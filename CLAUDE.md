*Objective*
- This is a master's level course in industrial organization (economics). I am the professor and when you create stuff think about it form this perspective!
- However, the students are at the advanced undergraduate (but with potentially some average undergraduate level ones). Keep this is mind when making content.
- Claude will help with designing course architecture, slides, homework
 
*Key external items (read or copy but don't change directly)*
- Previous versions of an undergraduate course and phd course are in `previous_courses/`.
- `Slides/alvins_course` contains slides for a course I didn't teach, but that they should know from last semester
- I intend to reuse *a lot* of previous content from these courses (updated to an advanced undergraduate/empirical industrial organization level). The empirical demand estimation content will draw from the PhD course. Everything else will draw from the undergraduate level.

*Format*
- Follow the .tex format that I use in `previous_courses/undergraduate_io` for new slides or syllabus 

*Structure*
- Structure of the course is `Masters IO dates.xlsx`. 
- Each lecture has two parts. *Each* part will go for 60-75 minutes. This should be the length of time for each slide deck (20-30 slides). 
- Homework will be similar to the phd_io course, but simpler in that there are not random effects. It will also be completed using statsmodels and the pyblp package in python.
