Lecture’s Objective
In this lecture we will go over some well-known models of oligopoly
There are a few ﬁrms in the market and large number of consumers
Classic models of oligopoly are Bertrand, Cournot, and Stackelberg
We will ﬁrst cover Bertrand oligopoly model
Firms in the market compete by choosing prices
We will then study Cournot oligopoly with many ﬁrms
Firms in the market compete by choosing quantities
Finally, we will analyze Bertrand oligopoly with diﬀerentiated products
In each case we study Nash equilibrium in pure strategies and its properties
We will leave Stakelberg model for later since it is a sequential game

Bertrand Oligopoly
Consider the following market for a homogeneous product:
There are two ﬁrms, ﬁrm 1 and ﬁrm 2
The market demand is given by x(p), strictly decreasing, continuous, with
x(p) > 0 for all 0 < p < ¯p < ∞, and x(p) = 0 for p ≥¯p
Firms have no ﬁxed costs and constant returns to scale production function,
and thus they have constant cost per unit and marginal cost c > 0
The competitive market quantity x(c) is strictly positive and less than inﬁnity
Firms simultaneously announce their prices per unit, p1 and p2
The quantity demanded from ﬁrm i, i = 1, 2 and j ̸= i, is
xi(pi, pj) =







x(pi)
if pi < pj
1
2x(pi)
if pi = pj
0
if pi > pj
Firms produce to order, so they incur cost only for output level that it sells
Firm i’s proﬁt is equal to (pi −c)xi(pi, pj)

Bertrand Oligopoly
It is easy to write the strategic form of the game:
Two players, ﬁrm 1 and ﬁrm 2
Strategy sets are S1 = [0, ∞), S2 = [0, ∞) with pi ∈Si, i = 1, 2
Payoﬀs are (p1 −c)x1(p1, p2) and (p2 −c)x2(p1, p2)
We will focus on pure strategies and derive the Nash equilibrium
There is a unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, given by
(p1, p2) = (c, c), and both ﬁrms make zero proﬁts
A remarkable feature is that despite the fact that the market has only two
ﬁrms, we obtain the perfectly competitive outcome
Intuition is that competition makes each ﬁrm face an inﬁnitely elastic
demand at the price charged by the competitor


## Page 7

Bertrand Oligopoly
Proof of unique Nash equilibrium (p1, p2) = (c, c)
Given that ﬁrm 2 charges p2 = c, then by charging p1 = c ﬁrm 1 makes 0,
while if it charges more it makes zero while if it charges p1 < c makes losses.
Similarly for ﬁrm 2 given that p1 = c. Hence, this is indeed a NE
If pi < pj < c or pi < c < pj, then ﬁrm i has incentives to raise pi to avoid
strictly negative proﬁts. Hence, there is no NE with these prices
If pi = c < pj, then ﬁrm i can increase proﬁts by setting a price between c and
pj (say pi = c + 0.5(pj −c)) and make strictly positive proﬁts. Hence, there is
no NE with these prices
If c < pi ≤pj, then ﬁrm j has incentives to deviate and charge pi −ε for
ε > 0 but small and sell to the entire market. For ε small,
(pi −ε −c)x(pi −ε) > 0.5(pj −c)x(pj), where the right side is the largest it
can make at the original prices. Hence, there is no NE with these prices
We have ruled out all alternative prices. Thus (c, c) is the unique NE


## Page 8

Bertrand Oligopoly
Remarks:
Similar result holds if there are n ≥2 ﬁrms
Assume that if k ﬁrms tie at the lowest price ˜p, then each receives 1
kx(˜p)
Then it is easy to show that (p1, p2, ..., pn) = (c, c, ..., c) is a NE (other NE?)
Note that the equilibrium is in weakly dominated strategies: pi = c is weakly
dominated by charging any pi > c (check)
Note that if the ﬁrms agree to behave as a monopolist, then they would each
charge the price that solves maxp(p −c)x(p), with FOC
x(p) + (p −c)x′(p) = 0 or p = c −x(p)
x′(p) > c, so ﬁrms would make strictly
positive proﬁts (each, say, half of proﬁts, or 1
n of them)
If no way to enforce this agreement, each has incentives to deviate (check)
What if the two ﬁrms have diﬀerent costs, say c1 < c2?
What if there are n ﬁrms with diﬀerent marginal costs ci, i = 1, 2, ..., n?

Cournot Oligopoly Model


## Page 10

Cournot Oligopoly
Consider Cournot duopoly but with homogeneous products
Firm 1 and ﬁrm 2 simultaneously choose q1 and q2
The inverse demand for the product is p(q1 + q2), where p(·) = x−1(·)
Assume p′(q) < 0 at all q = q1 + q2 ≥0
Both ﬁrms produce at constant marginal cost c > 0, with c < p(0)
We will assume there is a unique q0 ∈(0, ∞) such that p(q0) = c or
x(c) = q0, where q0 is the competitive market quantity
Each ﬁrm i chooses qi to maximize p(qi + qj)qi −cqi, i = 1, 2, j ̸= i
We will restrict attention to pure strategies


## Page 11

Cournot Oligopoly
Let us show that in any NE, the market price is strictly above c
To see this, obtain the FOC for ﬁrms 1 and 2 (check)
p′(q1 + q2)q1 + p(q1 + q2) = c
p′(q1 + q2)q2 + p(q1 + q2) = c
One can actually show that solution is interior (check)
Add the two FOCs to obtain
p′(q1 + q2)q1 + q2
2
+ p(q1 + q2) = c
Since p′(q) < 0, we obtain
p(q1 + q2) = c −p′(q1 + q2)q1 + q2
2
> c
In any NE ﬁrms obtain strictly positive proﬁts, unlike Bertrand


## Page 12

Cournot Oligopoly
Next, let us show that in any NE, q1 + q2 > qm, the monopoly quantity
We ﬁrst show that we cannot have qm > q1 + q2
If so, then ﬁrm i could deviate and produce qi = qm −qj, which would
increase joint proﬁts and reduce price
But this means that ﬁrm j is worse oﬀ, and thus ﬁrm i’s proﬁts are strictly
higher, contradicting NE
We next show that we cannot have q1 + q2 = qm
If so, then form addition of the FOCs we obtain
p′(qm)qm
2 + p(qm) = c
which cannot hold since in monopoly p′(qm)qm + p(qm) = c (why?)
Thus, q1 + q2 > qm, which implies that p(q1 + q2) < p(qm)
Hence, Cournot duopoly leads to aggregate quantity strictly below the
competitive one but strictly above the monopoly one

All the results extend to n ﬁrms
Suppose that there are n ﬁrms each with c > 0
Deriving the FOCs and then adding them yield the following equation (check)

Note that if n = 1 we obtain the monopoly FOC
As n →∞we obtain that p(Pn

To see this, note that from above Pn

produces aggregate output below the perfectly competitive output)
But then, 0 ≤

As an example, assume p = a −bq, where q = Pn

and check properties above

Cournot Oligopoly
Remarks:
Intuition for strictly positive proﬁts is that now ﬁrms do not face an inﬁnitely
elastic demand: if a ﬁrm reduces its quantity, it increases the price by
approximately −p′(q) (q total quantity)
Diﬀerent marginal costs easy to accommodate: try it for n = 2 and c1 < c2
(what does your intuition tell you?)
We have an analogue of the mark-up equation we saw in the monopoly case.
From the FOC of ﬁrm i, we obtain
p(q) −c
p(q)
= −p′(q)
p(q) qi = −p′(q) q

Bertrand Oligopoly with Diﬀerentiated Products


## Page 16

Bertrand with Diﬀerentiated Products
If ﬁrms in oligopoly choose prices but the products are diﬀerentiated, then
they make strictly positive proﬁts in NE
Assume the following market structure:
There are two ﬁrms, ﬁrm 1 and ﬁrm 2
Each ﬁrm has constant marginal cost c > 0
Firm i faces a demand for its product given by xi(pi, pj) = a −pi + bpj,
i = 1, 2, j ̸= i, a > c, and 0 < b < 2
Each ﬁrm i chooses pi to maximize proﬁts (pi −c)xi(pi, pj)
Strategic-form of the game:
Players: ﬁrm 1 and ﬁrm 2
Strategies: pi ∈Si = [0, ∞), i = 1, 2
Payoﬀs: ﬁrm i’s payoﬀ(pi −c)xi(pi, pj), i = 1, 2


## Page 17

Bertrand with Diﬀerentiated Products
Let us ﬁnd the unique NE of the game:
Firm 1 solves maxp1≥0(p1 −c)(a −p1 + bp2), and FOC is
a −2p1 + bp2 + c = 0 ⇒p1 = a + c + bp2
2
Firm 2 solves maxp2≥0(p2 −c)(a −p2 + bp2), and FOC is
a −2p2 + bp1 + c = 0 ⇒p2 = a + c + bp1
2
Solving the two equations in two unknowns (p1, p2) we obtain the NE
p1 = p2 = a + c
2 −b
The proﬁt for each ﬁrm is u1(p1, p2) = u2(p1, p2) = (a+(b−1)c)2
(2−b)2
> 0
Remark:
Intuition is that consumers do not consider the products as perfect substitutes,
so if a ﬁrm that charges more does not lose all of its sales
Firms beneﬁt from product diﬀerentiation or from cost reduction technologies

Leader-Follower Market
Consider the following market structure:
Two ﬁrms, ﬁrm 1 (leader) and ﬁrm 2 (follower)
Firms produce a homogeneous product at constant marginal cost c > 0
Firm 1 chooses its production level ﬁrst, then ﬁrm 2 observes the quantity
produced by ﬁrm 1, and chooses its own production level
Market inverse demand p(q1 + q2) determines the price per unit
p(q) strictly decreasing with p′(q) < 0, p(0) > c, and p′′(q) ≤0
The items of the extensive representation of this game are:
Players: ﬁrm 1 and ﬁrm 2
Order of moves: ﬁrm 1 chooses ﬁrst and ﬁrm 2 second
Actions sets of each player: q1 ∈[0, ∞), q2 ∈[0, ∞)
Information: ﬁrm 2 observes q1 before choosing q2
Payoﬀs: ui(qi, qj) = p(qi + qj)qi −cqi, i = 1, 2


## Page 20

Leader-Follower Market
Note that this is a game with complete and perfect information
Unlike examples we saw, it has a continuum of strategies
Let us ﬁnd the SPE of this game by backwards induction
After each q1 there is a node at which ﬁrm 2 chooses q2
max
q2 p(q1 + q2)q2 −cq2 ⇒p′(q1 + q2)q2 + p(q1 + q2) = c ⇒q2(q1)
Let us move backwards and solve the problem of ﬁrm 1, which anticipates that
in the continuation of the game ﬁrm 2 responds with q2(q1)
max
q1 p(q1 + q2(q1))q1 −cq1 ⇒p′(q1 + q2(q1))(1 + q′
2(q1))q1 + p(q1 + q2(q1) =
Solving FOC for q1 we obtain optimal quantity ﬁrm 1 produces, q∗
1
Then the SPE is (q∗
1, q2(q1)), and SPE outcome is (q∗
1, q2(q∗
1)) = (q∗
1, q∗
2)


## Page 21

Leader-Follower Market
Let us show that the output of ﬁrm 1 is larger and that of ﬁrm 2 smaller than
in the Cournot duopoly case, and ﬁrm 1’s proﬁts are strictly higher
FOC of ﬁrm 2 is exactly the same as in Cournot (interpretation is diﬀerent)
FOC of ﬁrm 1 has an extra term, p′(q1 + q2(q1))q′
2(q1)
We show that q′
2(q1) < 0; diﬀerentiating FOC of ﬁrm 2 with respect of q1
p′′(q1+q2(q1))(1+q′
2(q1))q2(q1)+p′(q1+q2(q1))q′
2(q1)+p′(q1+q2(q1))(1+q′
2(q1))
Therefore, q′
2(q1) is equal to
q′
2 = −p′′q2 + p′
p′′q2 + 2p′ < 0
But then the marginal beneﬁt of expanding q1 is higher than in Cournot
duopoly, since extra term is strictly positive, and thus ﬁrm 1 produces strictly
more than in Cournot case
Since ﬁrm 1 could have picked the q1 from the Cournot case but chooses
something diﬀerent, its proﬁts must be strictly higher


## Page 22

Leader-Follower Market
How about aggregate output produced compared to Cournot duopoly?
Note that aggregate quantity produced is q1 + q2 = q1 + q2(q1)
We know that q∗
1 is strictly higher than in Cournot duopoly
Now, the derivative of the raggregate quantity is 1 + q′
2(q1), where
q′
2 = −p′′q2 + p′
p′′q2 + 2p′ < 0
But then
1 + q′
2(q1) = p′′q2 + 2p′ −(p′′q2 + p′)
p′′q2 + 2p′
=
p′
p′′q2 + 2p′ > 0
Thus, aggregate output strictly increases


## Page 23

Leader-Follower Market
How about and proﬁts of ﬁrm 2?
Since aggregate output is strictly higher in Stackelberg than in Cournot, , the
price per unit decreases
Since price is lower, aggregate proﬁts are lower in Stackelberg than Cournot
To see this, let us compute aggregate proﬁts as a function of q1 + q2:
p(q)q1 −cq1 + p(q)q2 −cq2 = p(q)q −cq = Π(q)
Then Πq = p′q + p −c; at Cournot quantities this is equal to zero (why?)
But since Πqq = p′′q + 2p′ < 0, and since aggregate quantity in Stackelberg is
strictly higher than in Cournot, it follows that Π(q) is strictly decreasing at q
equal to Stackelberg aggregate quantity
Thus, aggregate proﬁts are strictly lower than in Cournot
And since ﬁrm 1’s proﬁts go up, it must be that ﬁrm 2’s proﬁts go down


## Page 24

Leader-Follower Market
Remarks:
There are lots of NE that are not SPE in this game
Example: ﬁrm 2 produces same quantity as in Cournot no matter what ﬁrm 1
produces; then optimal response for ﬁrm 1 is to produce Cournot quantity
Formally, ﬁrm 2 uses the strategy q2(q1) is constant and equal to the Cournot
quantity no matter what q1 is
But this is clearly not SPE since it is not optimal for ﬁrm 2 to produce the
Cournot quantity if ﬁrm 1 produces a q1 diﬀerent from Cournot (check)
Many more (an inﬁnite number of) NE can be constructed in a similar way
This application illustrates how much power SPE can have over NE
Easy to extend the analysis with multiple followers (try it!)

Collusion


## Page 26

Repeated Cournot Oligopoly
There n ﬁrms that compete as in Cournot model
Demand is linear and given by p = a −bq, q = Pn
i=1 qi
Cost of each ﬁrm is c(qi) = cqi, 0 < c < a
Proﬁts of ﬁrm i are πi(qi, q−i) = (a −b(qi, q−i))qi −cqi
We assume these ﬁrms play an inﬁnitely repeated game, in which the stage
game that is repeated is the static Cournot model
Each ﬁrm discount future payoﬀs with δ ∈(0, 1)
Using what we learned from repeated game, we show tacit collusion can
emerge, and each ﬁrm can make more proﬁts than in static Cournot model
Intuitively, this will require suﬃciently patient ﬁrms (large δ)


## Page 27

NE of Stage Game and Collusive Proﬁts
Recall the NE of the stage game
Each ﬁrm i solves
max
qi (a −b(qi + q−i) −c)qi ⇒(a −b(2qi + q−i) −c = 0
Solving the system of FOCs, we obtain a symmetric NE in which

NE of Stage Game and Collusive Proﬁts
If these ﬁrms behave jointly as a monopolist (collusion), then
They solve maxq(a −bq)q −cq, FOC a −2bq −c = 0 and qm = a−c

If they split output equally, then the collusive output is qc

Each ﬁrm then makes

NE of Stage Game and Collusive Proﬁts
Remarks:
Calculated NE quantity of stage game, collusive one, and deviation quantity
It is easy to check (do it) that for each i, qc
i < qne
i
< qd
i
Under collusion ﬁrms restrict production to maximize joint proﬁts, so collusive
quantity is lower for each ﬁrm than in NE, but in turn the best deviation is an
even larger quantity than NE
We have also calculated the proﬁts in each of those cases
It is intuitive and easy to check (do it) that for each i, πne
i
< πc
i < πd
i
Now, we know in static Cournot oligopoly there is no way to sustain collusion
But collusion can occur in inﬁnitely repeated game if ﬁrms are patient enough


## Page 31

Collusion in Inﬁnitely Repeated Cournot Oligopoly
Consider the following trigger strategies: each ﬁrm i plays
Firm i: si(h0) = qc
i ; at any t ≥1, si(ht) = qc
i if ht consists of t −1 repetition
of (qc
1, ..., qc
n); for any other ht, play si(ht) = qne
i
Each ﬁrm conjectures that the other ﬁrms will play according to this strategy
This partitions histories into two kinds: those in which qc
i for every i has been
played in every previous period, and all the other histories
In all other histories, (qne
1 , ..., qne
n ) in every period, a NE in each subgame
Consider histories of the ﬁrst kind: if player i plays qc

We thus have the following result:
Every player i will have incentives to play qc

If δ is above this threshold, then the trigger strategies are a SPE, and its
outcome is qc

Note that it is enough for the players to understand or believe that every other
player behaves according to the above trigger strategy
There is no need for communication among ﬁrms: tacit collusion
Important real-world problem repeated games have shed light on: it is a very
relevant problem for antitrust policy and for economic analysis of markets
There are many variations and extensions of this type of construction
An interesting variation is one in which ﬁrms do not observe the quantities
produced by other ﬁrms, and the demand is subject to random shocks, so price
is a noisy signal of quantities. Important application: OPEC
