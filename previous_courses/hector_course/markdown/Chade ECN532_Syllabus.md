Course Description 
This core class is the second course in microeconomic theory. It provides the students with a solid 
background in game theory and information economics. Regarding game theory, this course covers 
static and dynamic games of complete information, with applications to oligopoly markets, bargaining, 
and repeated interactions, and static and dynamic games with incomplete information, with applications 
to auctions and signaling in markets.  theory, production and cost, choice under uncertainty, perfect 
competition, monopoly, games with complete information, and oligopoly. Regarding information 
economics, the course covers contracting problems with moral hazard, markets with adverse selection, 
and screening and signaling in markets. Students will obtain the requisite background in these topics 
that are needed for understanding fundamental real-world economic applications.

Items in bold have significant coverage in this course. 
Course Learning Objectives 
1. Provide a solid foundation on microeconomic analysis of individual units, markets, and strategic 
settings  
2. Provide a deep understanding of fundamental optimization problems solved by agents in different 
contexts, be it a consumer choosing a bundle of goods, or an insurance policy, or a firm choosing 
the pricing of its output 
3. Provide a thorough coverage of standard equilibrium concepts used in economic theory: 
competitive equilibrium, Nash Equilibrium, Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium 
4. Illustrate the applicability of each topic with carefully chosen real-world economic problems 
 
Required Textbook and Other Materials  
The class is based on the detailed slides that will be created for each topic, complemented by the notes 
you will take in class.  
On top of your class notes, here are some recommended textbooks:  
Varian, Hal and Marc Melitz, Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach, tenth edition, 2024. 
This is an excellent reference for intuition and a basic treatment of the topics we will cover in class. 
Tadelis, Steven, Game Theory: An Introduction, 2013. This is an excellent reference on game theory that 
which covers all the game theoretic concepts we will develop in class.

Assignments and Examinations   
Every week there will be an assignment corresponding to the topic covered that week, to be turned in 
the following week on Canvas before the class starts. Late work is not accepted. 
The midterm exam will cover approximately the first half of the course material and will take place on 
November 12th during class time.  
The final exam will cover the second half of the course material (it is not cumulative) and will take place 
the last day of class, December 10th, during class time.

Course Outline 
The course assumes as a pre-requisite a good command of the topics covered during the math boot 
camp, and also those covered in ECN 530. We will cover the following topics in this course: 
1) Normal Form Games: definition and examples. 
2) Static Games with Complete Information: dominated strategies, iterative elimination of 
dominated strategies, rationalizability, Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, Cournot and 
Bertrand oligopoly models, mixed strategies, Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies, examples, 
existence of Nash equilibrium. 
3) Extensive-Form Games: definition and examples. 
4) Dynamic Games of Complete Information: sequential rationality, backward induction, 
subgames, subgame-perfect equilibrium, Stackleberg oligopoly model, sequential bargaining. 
5) Repeated Games: Multi-stage games, one-shot deviation principle, finitely and infinitely 
repeated games, collusion in oligopoly, the folk theorem. 
6) Static Games of Incomplete Information: Bayesian Games, Bayesian equilibrium, auctions. 
7) Dynamic Games of Incomplete Information: Sequential rationality and beliefs, Perfect-Bayesian 
equilibrium, signaling games. 
8) Moral Hazard: principal-agent problem, participation and incentive constraints, optimal 
incentive contract. 
9) Adverse Selection: Akerlof’s market for lemons, screening models, signaling in markets.
