\section{The discrete Bertrand game (p186)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Question}: Two firms set prices simultaneously. Consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price and split their demand equally across the two firms if prices are equal. Market demand is $q=10-p$, $MC=2$. Sellers can only set the following prices: $3,4,5$.
		\item 1. Write down the normal form game.
		\item 2. Solve for the equilibrium of the game.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Ex. 7.7 HDTV Standards}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Question:} US and Japan simultaneously decide whether to invest a high or low value into HDTV research. If both countries choose `low' payoffs are (4,3) for the US and Japan respectively. If US chooses low level and Japan a high level, payoffs are (2,4). If US chooses high level and Japan low, payoffs are (3,2). If both countries chooses a high level, payoffs are (1,1). 
		\item 1. Are there any dominant strategies in this game? What is the Nash equilibrium? What are the implicit rationality assumptions?
		\item 2. Suppose the US now has the option of committing to a strategy ahead of Japan. How would you model this situation? What are the subgame-perfect Nash equilbria of this game?
		\item 3. Comparing your answers to 1. and 2., what can you say about the value of commitment for the US?
	\end{itemize}

\section{Price match guarantee in the market for luxury cars}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two firms are competing on prices. Each firm can choose to set a high price $p_H$ or a low price $p_L$, where $p_H > p_L$. Profits are given by:

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Draw the extensive form if firm 1 moves first. Solve for the subgame perfect equilibrium.
			\item Suppose firm 1 offers consumers to match its price with the lowest price in the market. Solve for the SPE of the modified game (Hint: modify the game to three stages, allowing firm 1 to make a move in the third stage only in the case where it chose $p_H$ in the first stage and firm 2 chose $p_L$ in the second stage.)

\section{Question from practice exam}
Consider the following game (where `x' stands for a number).

\begin{figure}[h]

	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\matrix[matrix of math nodes,every odd row/.style={align=right},every evenrow/.style={align=left},every node/.style={text width=1.5cm},row sep=0.2cm,column sep=0.2cm,ampersand replacement=\&] (m) {
			50 \& 50 - x \\
			0 \phantom{---------} \& 0 \phantom{--------} \\
			20 \& -20\\
			10 \phantom{--------} \& -20 \phantom{------}  \\
		};
		\draw (m.north east) rectangle (m.south west);
		\draw (m.north) -- (m.south);
		\draw (m.east) -- (m.west);
		
		% Player 1
		\coordinate (c) at ($(m.north west)!0.25!(m.south west)$);
		\coordinate (d) at ($(m.north west)!0.75!(m.south west)$);

		\node[left=2pt of d,text width=1cm]  {B};

		\node[above=18pt of m.north] (firm b) {Player 2};
		\node[left=1.6cm of m.west,rotate=90,align=center,anchor=center] {Player 1};
		
		%\node[above=5pt of firm b]  {Payoff Matrix};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Assume that $x=0$. What are all the Nash equilibria?
	\item Provide a value of $x$ where (B,L) is the \textit{unique} Nash equilibrium?
	\item Assume that $x=0$ and that the players play (B,L) in the simultaneous game. How much would player 2 pay to commit to moving first? (Hint: it might be helpful to write out the sequential game.)
	\item Assume that player 2 moves first. Provide a value of $x$ to ensure that $(B,L)$ is the unique subgame-perfect equilibrium.
