	\vspace{11pt}
	\question Depending on the question, write either: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a number 
		\item one of: True, False, or NEI (Not Enough Information)
		\item a definition (i.e. one or a few words)

	\begin{parts}
		\part[3] What `problem' can occur in vertical relationships if one firm needs to make a relationship-specific investment, but the other firm cannot commit to pay them until after the investment has been made?
		
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] What is one \textit{benefit} (that we discussed in class) from vertical integration?
		
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] Suppose there is an upstream manufacturer $M$ selling an input to two downstream retailers $R_1$ and $R_2$ (and these downstream retailers are competing against each other). If the manufacturer merges with $R_1$, would you expect the wholesale price between $M$ and $R_1$ to increase or decrease, compared to vertical separation?
		
		\answerline[answer]
		
		%\part[3] True, False, or Not Enough Information: If firms have the same constant marginal cost, the `follower' firm in Stackelberg competition makes a higher profit than the `leader' firm.
		\part[3] Consider again the merger in the previous question. Would you expect the wholesale price between $M$ and $R_2$ to increase or decrease, compared to vertical separation?
		
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] True, False, or Not Enough Information: If price cuts are difficult to observe, then occasional price wars may be necessary
		to discipline collusive agreements.
		
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] True, False, or Not Enough Information: As the number of firms in a market increases it \textit{typically} makes it \textit{harder} for firms to form a collusive agreement.
		
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] Suppose there are three firms in a market with market shares 0.5, 0.25, and, 0.25, respectively. Compute the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.

		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] What is the value of the Lerner index in a monopoly market?
		
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] What is the value of the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index under perfect competition?

		\answerline[answer]
				
		\part[3] Consider an identical n-firm Cournot market with market size $S=1$, total demand $p=10-Q$ (where Q is the total market quantity), and the total cost for each firm is $C(q)=1+q$. Assuming that firms continue to enter so long as profit is not negative, how many firms will enter the market in equilibrium?
		\answerline[answer]

		\part[3] Give the reason (discussed in class) why the beer market in the US has approximately the same number of firms as the beer market in Portugal, despite being 30x-50x its size.
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] What is the value of the `four-firm concentration index' if there are three firms in a market?
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] True, False, or Not Enough Information: If barriers to entry are not very high, then mergers tend to be followed by new
		firm entry.
		\answerline[answer]

		\part[3] True, False, or Not Enough Information: Provide one concern (that we discussed in class) that a regulator might have when deciding whether to approve a merger.
		\answerline[answer]
		
		\part[3] True, False, or Not Enough Information: Provide one benefit (that we discussed in class) that a regulator might consider when deciding whether to approve a merger.

	\subsection*{Movie Theater Question (30 points)}
	\question Suppose you are the owner of a movie theater. There are two types of customers: students (denoted `s') and non-students (denoted `ns'). The demand for movie seats for each of these segments is:
	\begin{align*}
		\text{Student: } &q_{s} = 75 - 2p_{s} \\
		\text{Non-student: }& q_{ns} = 80 - p_{ns}
	\end{align*}
	\begin{parts}
		\part [30] Assume that you cannot distinguish between students and non-students, and so you can only set a single \textit{uniform price} for all consumers. Assume that the marginal cost of a seat is \$15. What is the optimal uniform price? 
		%\vspace{500pt}
		%\answerline[answer] 
	\end{parts}
	
	\subsection*{Stackelberg Competition (30 points)}
	\question There are two firms in a market with total demand $p=100-2Q$. Firm 1 moves first and Firm 2 moves second. Firm 1's total cost is $C(q_1)=1+2q_1^2$.  Firm 2's total cost is $C(q_2)=0$. 
	\vspace{11pt}
\begin{parts}
	\part[30] Suppose that the firms compete in a Stackelberg equilibrium. What is the equilibrium quantity for \underline{Firm 1}?
	%\vspace{500pt}
	%\answerline[answer]
	%\part[15] Suppose now that Firm 2 (the potential entrant) now chooses whether to enter after Firm 1 makes its production decision. If Firm 2 enters then it pays an entry cost $E=16$. Which values of $q_1$ deter Firm 2's entry?
\end{parts}

	\subsection*{Hotelling Model (30 points)}
\question Suppose 100 consumers are uniformly distributed on a 1 mile stretch of road. There are two supermarkets on the road: Supermarket 1 is located at the west end of the road (at location = 0), and Supermarket 2 is part way along the road (at location = 0.3). Transport costs for consumers are \underline{\$1.0 per mile}. The supermarkets' marginal costs are 0. The supermarkets compete on prices: denote Supermarket 1's price $p_1$ and Supermarket 2's price $p_2$.
\begin{parts}
	\part[20] What is the demand for each supermarket?\footnote{When computing consumer choices, only consider the transport costs to get to the supermarket, don't worry about the return journey.}
	%\vspace{500pt}
	%\answerline[answer]
	%\newpage
	\part[10] If Firm 2 chooses a price $p_2=0.2$, what is Firm 1's best response $p_1$?
\end{parts}

	\subsection*{Collusion (30 points)}
\question Consider the following game and suppose that it is repeated an infinite number of times. Players have a discount value of $\delta$.

\end{figure}

\begin{parts}
	\part[30] For what values of $\delta$ can collusion on (T,L) be sustained under the following grim trigger strategy:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Play (T,L) if (T,L) has been played in all previous periods
		\item Otherwise play (B,R).
	\end{itemize}
\end{parts}

	\subsection*{Vertical Relationships (30 points)}
\question Suppose that there are two firms in a supply chain: a manufacturer who sells to a retailer. The timing is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Manufacturer has a constant marginal cost $c=1$ and sets input price $w$ to maximize profit.
	\item Retailer buys input from manufacturer for price $w$. Retailer sets price $p$ to maximize profit with demand $D(p)= 8-p$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{parts}
	\part[20] What are the joint profits of the firms (i.e. the sum of the profit of the manufacturer and the retailer) under vertical separation?
	\part[10] Explain in one to two sentences why the joint profits will be higher under vertical integration than under vertical separation.
