- Key questions: market power, firm strategy, welfare implications
- Historical development: SCP paradigm → game theory approach

### Chapter 2: Basic Microeconomics
- Profit maximization: MR = MC
- Consumer surplus and welfare analysis
- Market structures: perfect competition to monopoly

### Chapter 3: Market Structure and Market Power
- Concentration measures: CR4, HHI = Σsᵢ²
- Lerner Index: L = (P - MC)/P = 1/ε
- Market definition and SSNIP test

### Chapter 4: Technology and Cost
- Production functions and returns to scale
- Cost curves: FC, VC, TC, AC, MC
- Economies of scale and scope
- Minimum efficient scale (MES)

## Part Two: Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice (Chapters 5-8)

### Chapter 5: Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing
- **First-degree:** Perfect price discrimination, extracts all surplus
- **Third-degree:** Group pricing based on observable characteristics
  - Optimal pricing: Higher price for less elastic group
  - Welfare effects: Ambiguous - may increase or decrease total welfare
  - Requires: Identifiable groups, no arbitrage

### Chapter 6: Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Nonlinear Pricing
- **Second-degree:** Menu of quantity-price bundles
- **Two-part tariffs:** Fixed fee F + per-unit price p
  - Single consumer type: p = MC, F = consumer surplus
  - Multiple types: Trade-off extraction vs. participation
- **Block pricing:** Declining marginal prices
- **Incentive compatibility:** High types prefer their bundle
- **No distortion at top:** Efficient quantity for highest type

### Chapter 7: Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly
- **Vertical differentiation:** Quality choice
  - Spence (1975): Monopolist may over- or under-provide quality
  - Mussa-Rosen model: Quality discrimination via versioning
- **Horizontal differentiation:** Product line breadth
- **Damaged goods:** Deliberately degraded versions for price discrimination

### Chapter 8: Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales
- **Pure bundling:** Only bundle available
- **Mixed bundling:** Bundle and components available
- **Tie-in sales:** Require purchase of tied good
- **Leverage theory:** Extend monopoly power to competitive market
- **Efficiency explanations:** Cost savings, quality assurance
- **Welfare effects:** Can increase or decrease welfare

## Part Three: Strategic Interaction and Oligopoly (Chapters 9-11)

### Chapter 9: Static Games and Cournot Competition
- **Nash equilibrium:** Mutual best responses
- **Cournot model:** Simultaneous quantity choice
  - Reaction functions: qᵢ = (a - c - qⱼ)/2b
  - Equilibrium: qᵢ* = (a - c)/3b (duopoly)
  - N firms: qᵢ* = (a - c)/(N+1)b
  - As N → ∞, approaches perfect competition
- **Comparative statics:** Cost changes, demand shifts

### Chapter 10: Bertrand Competition and Price Wars
- **Bertrand paradox:** Two firms → competitive price (P = MC)
- **Capacity constraints:** Edgeworth cycles, Cournot-like outcomes
- **Product differentiation:** Softens price competition
  - Higher differentiation → higher equilibrium prices
- **Bertrand vs. Cournot:** Bertrand more competitive
- **Resolution:** Capacity choice (Cournot) then price (Bertrand)

### Chapter 11: Dynamic Games and First/Second Mover Advantages
- **Sequential games:** Backward induction
- **Stackelberg competition:**
  - Leader commits to quantity first
  - Leader advantage: qL = (a-c)/2b > qC
  - Follower accommodates: qF = (a-c)/4b < qC
- **First-mover advantage:** Commitment value
- **Second-mover advantage:** Learn and respond (some contexts)
- **Subgame perfect equilibrium:** Nash in every subgame

## Part Four: Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy (Chapters 12-14)

### Chapter 12: Entry Deterrence and Predation
- **Limit pricing:** Price low to signal high cost/deter entry
  - Bain-Sylos-Labini: Assumes entrant expects incumbent output unchanged
  - Criticized for non-credible threat
- **Capacity expansion (Dixit 1980):**
  - Sunk capacity investment K₁ makes threat credible
  - Changes incumbent's marginal cost from w+r to w for q ≤ K₁
  - Shifts reaction function, can deter entry
- **Preemption (Eaton-Lipsey 1979):** Spatial preemption
- **Bundling to deter entry (Nalebuff 2004)**
- **Empirical cases:** Alcoa, DuPont titanium dioxide

### Chapter 13: Predatory Conduct
- **McGee (1958):** Merger dominates predation
  - But: Merger attracts entry
- **Chicago School:** Predation irrational (equally costly to predator)
- **Post-Chicago models with asymmetric information:**
  - **Bolton-Scharfstein (1990):** Financial constraints
    - Bank uses low-profit report as signal, cuts funding
    - Predator induces low profits to trigger exit
  - **Milgrom-Roberts (1982):** Limit pricing with incomplete information
    - Low price signals low cost, deters entry
- **Areeda-Turner rule:** Price below AVC is predatory
- **Contracts as barriers (Aghion-Bolton 1987):**
  - Exclusive dealing with breach penalty
  - Can block efficient entry

### Chapter 14: Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust
- **Cartel problem:** Prisoner's dilemma
- **Repeated games:**
  - **Selten's Theorem:** Finite repetition → defect in all periods
  - **Folk Theorem:** Infinite repetition with high discount factor → cooperation sustainable
- **Critical discount factor:**
  - Bertrand: ρ* = 0.5
  - Cournot: ρ* = (N²+2N-1)/(N+1)² ≈ 0.529 (duopoly)
  - General: ρ* = (πᴰ - πᴹ)/(πᴰ - πᴺ)
- **Factors facilitating collusion:**
  - Few firms: ρ*(N) = 1 - 1/N
  - High entry barriers
  - Frequent/regular orders
  - Cost/technology symmetry
  - Multi-market contact
  - Product homogeneity
  - Stable/growing demand
- **Antitrust enforcement:**
  - Detection probability q, fine F
  - Need q × F > gain from deviation
  - Leniency programs: Reduce cartel formation ~40% (Miller 2009)
