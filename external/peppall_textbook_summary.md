## Part Two: Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice (Chapters 5-8)

### Chapter 5: Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing
- **First-degree:** Perfect price discrimination, extracts all surplus
- **Third-degree:** Group pricing based on observable characteristics
  - Optimal pricing: Higher price for less elastic group
  - Welfare effects: Ambiguous - may increase or decrease total welfare
  - Requires: Identifiable groups, no arbitrage

### Chapter 6: Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Nonlinear Pricing
- **Second-degree:** Menu of quantity-price bundles
- **Two-part tariffs:** Fixed fee F + per-unit price p
  - Single consumer type: p = MC, F = consumer surplus
  - Multiple types: Trade-off extraction vs. participation
- **Block pricing:** Declining marginal prices
- **Incentive compatibility:** High types prefer their bundle
- **No distortion at top:** Efficient quantity for highest type

### Chapter 7: Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly
- **Vertical differentiation:** Quality choice
  - Spence (1975): Monopolist may over- or under-provide quality
  - Mussa-Rosen model: Quality discrimination via versioning
- **Horizontal differentiation:** Product line breadth
- **Damaged goods:** Deliberately degraded versions for price discrimination

### Chapter 8: Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales
- **Pure bundling:** Only bundle available
- **Mixed bundling:** Bundle and components available
- **Tie-in sales:** Require purchase of tied good
- **Leverage theory:** Extend monopoly power to competitive market
- **Efficiency explanations:** Cost savings, quality assurance
- **Welfare effects:** Can increase or decrease welfare

---

## Part Three: Strategic Interaction and Oligopoly (Chapters 9-11)

### Chapter 9: Static Games and Cournot Competition
- **Nash equilibrium:** Mutual best responses
- **Cournot model:** Simultaneous quantity choice
  - Reaction functions: qᵢ = (a - c - qⱼ)/2b
  - Equilibrium: qᵢ* = (a - c)/3b (duopoly)
  - N firms: qᵢ* = (a - c)/(N+1)b
  - As N → ∞, approaches perfect competition
- **Comparative statics:** Cost changes, demand shifts

### Chapter 10: Bertrand Competition and Price Wars
- **Bertrand paradox:** Two firms → competitive price (P = MC)
- **Capacity constraints:** Edgeworth cycles, Cournot-like outcomes
- **Product differentiation:** Softens price competition
  - Higher differentiation → higher equilibrium prices
- **Bertrand vs. Cournot:** Bertrand more competitive
- **Resolution:** Capacity choice (Cournot) then price (Bertrand)

### Chapter 11: Dynamic Games and First/Second Mover Advantages
- **Sequential games:** Backward induction
- **Stackelberg competition:**
  - Leader commits to quantity first
  - Leader advantage: qL = (a-c)/2b > qC
  - Follower accommodates: qF = (a-c)/4b < qC
- **First-mover advantage:** Commitment value
- **Second-mover advantage:** Learn and respond (some contexts)
- **Subgame perfect equilibrium:** Nash in every subgame

---

## Part Four: Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy (Chapters 12-14)

### Chapter 12: Entry Deterrence and Predation
- **Limit pricing:** Price low to signal high cost/deter entry
  - Bain-Sylos-Labini: Assumes entrant expects incumbent output unchanged
  - Criticized for non-credible threat
- **Capacity expansion (Dixit 1980):**
  - Sunk capacity investment K₁ makes threat credible
  - Changes incumbent's marginal cost from w+r to w for q ≤ K₁
  - Shifts reaction function, can deter entry
- **Preemption (Eaton-Lipsey 1979):** Spatial preemption
- **Bundling to deter entry (Nalebuff 2004)**
- **Empirical cases:** Alcoa, DuPont titanium dioxide

### Chapter 13: Predatory Conduct
- **McGee (1958):** Merger dominates predation
  - But: Merger attracts entry
- **Chicago School:** Predation irrational (equally costly to predator)
- **Post-Chicago models with asymmetric information:**
  - **Bolton-Scharfstein (1990):** Financial constraints
    - Bank uses low-profit report as signal, cuts funding
    - Predator induces low profits to trigger exit
  - **Milgrom-Roberts (1982):** Limit pricing with incomplete information
    - Low price signals low cost, deters entry
- **Areeda-Turner rule:** Price below AVC is predatory
- **Contracts as barriers (Aghion-Bolton 1987):**
  - Exclusive dealing with breach penalty
  - Can block efficient entry

### Chapter 14: Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust
- **Cartel problem:** Prisoner's dilemma
- **Repeated games:**
  - **Selten's Theorem:** Finite repetition → defect in all periods
  - **Folk Theorem:** Infinite repetition with high discount factor → cooperation sustainable
- **Critical discount factor:**
  - Bertrand: δ* = 0.5
  - Cournot: δ* = (N²+2N-1)/(N+1)² ≈ 0.529 (duopoly)
  - General: δ* = (πᴰ - πᴹ)/(πᴰ - πᴺ)
- **Factors facilitating collusion:**
  - Few firms: δ*(N) = 1 - 1/N
  - High entry barriers
  - Frequent/regular orders
  - Cost/technology symmetry
  - Multi-market contact
  - Product homogeneity
  - Stable/growing demand
- **Antitrust enforcement:**
  - Detection probability q, fine F
  - Need q × F > gain from deviation
  - Leniency programs: Reduce cartel formation ~40% (Miller 2009)

## Part Five: Contractual Relations Between Firms (Chapters 15-18)

### Chapter 15: Horizontal Mergers
- **Merger paradox:** In Cournot model, mergers often unprofitable unless:
  - Merger creates Stackelberg leader position
  - Significant cost synergies exist
  - Many firms merge simultaneously
- **Merger simulation:**
  - PCAIDS (Proportionally Calibrated AIDS) system
  - Estimate demand elasticities, compute post-merger prices
  - Lerner condition: L = (P - MC)/P
- **HHI thresholds:**
  - <1500: unconcentrated
  - 1500-2500: moderately concentrated
  - >2500: highly concentrated
- **Merger evaluation tools:** Divestiture, "fix-it-first" approach

### Chapter 16: Vertical Integration
- **Double marginalization:** Two successive monopolies → price too high
  - Vertical integration solves this problem
- **Vertical mergers in Cournot:**
  - Upstream and downstream foreclosure effects
  - Raising rivals' costs strategy
- **GE-Honeywell case:** Concerns about bundling post-merger

### Chapter 17: Vertical Price Restraints
- **Resale Price Maintenance (RPM):**
  - Minimum RPM: Sets price floor
  - Maximum RPM: Sets price ceiling
- **Service provision model:**
  - Retailers provide costly services that increase demand
  - Free-riding problem: Discount stores benefit from full-service stores
  - RPM can solve free-riding by guaranteeing retail margins
- **RPM and collusion:**
  - Can facilitate manufacturer collusion (easier to monitor)
  - Can facilitate retailer collusion
- **Legal evolution:**
  - *Dr. Miles* (1911): Per se illegal
  - *Leegin* (2007): Rule of reason

### Chapter 18: Non-Price Vertical Restraints
- **Exclusive territories:** Prevent intra-brand competition
- **Exclusive dealing:** Prevent inter-brand competition
  - Can foreclose rivals from distribution
- **Franchising and divisionalization:**
  - Franchise fees extract retailer surplus
  - Divisionalization can increase competitive intensity

## Part Six: Non-Price Competition (Chapters 19-21)

### Chapter 19: Advertising
- **Dorfman-Steiner condition:**
  - A/R = εₐ/|εₚ|
  - Advertising/sales ratio equals ratio of elasticities
- **Advertising as information:**
  - Informative: Expands market awareness
  - Persuasive: Shifts preferences, may reduce competition
- **Signaling through advertising:**
  - High advertising signals high quality (experience goods)
  - Nelson (1974): "Burning money" as quality signal

### Chapter 20: Research and Development
- **Innovation types:**
  - Process innovation: Reduces production cost
  - Product innovation: Creates new/improved goods
- **Drastic vs. non-drastic innovations:**
  - Drastic: Monopolist's ideal price < competitive price
  - Non-drastic: Must limit price to deter fringe
- **Schumpeterian hypothesis:**
  - Large firms and concentrated markets → more innovation
  - Arrow (1962): Competitive firms have more incentive
  - Empirical evidence: Mixed, inverted-U relationship
- **Patent races:**
  - Winner-take-all competition
  - May lead to over-investment in R&D
  - Dasgupta-Stiglitz model

### Chapter 21: Patents and Patent Policy
- **Optimal patent life:**
  - Trade-off: Innovation incentives vs. deadweight loss
  - Nordhaus model: Balancing considerations
- **Optimal patent breadth:**
  - Narrow: Many substitutes possible
  - Broad: Few substitutes, more monopoly power
  - Gilbert-Shapiro: "Long and thin" may be optimal
- **Patent licensing:**
  - Royalty vs. fixed fee
  - Can increase welfare by spreading technology

## Part Seven: Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment (Chapters 22-24)

### Chapter 22: Network Effects and Network Goods
- **Network externalities:**
  - Direct: Value increases with users (telephone, social media)
  - Indirect: Value through complements (hardware-software)
- **Critical mass:** Minimum adoption for market takeoff
- **Multiple equilibria:** Low-adoption and high-adoption possible
- **Installed base:** Source of competitive advantage
- **Standards competition:**
  - Compatibility vs. proprietary strategies
  - Tipping: Market converges to single standard
- **Path dependence:** Historical accidents affect outcomes
- **Two-sided markets:** Platforms must attract both sides

### Chapter 23: Auctions
- **Auction types:**
  - English (ascending): Bid true value (dominant strategy)
  - Dutch (descending): Shade bid below value
  - First-price sealed bid: Shade bid below value
  - Second-price sealed bid (Vickrey): Bid true value

- **Key results:**
  - With uniform [0, V_max] and n bidders: E[v(k)] = k/(n+1) × V_max
  - First-price optimal bid: b(vᵢ) = ((n-1)/n) × vᵢ
  - **Revenue Equivalence Theorem:** All auction types yield same expected revenue

- **Common value auctions:**
  - **Winner's curse:** Winning means you likely overestimated
  - Must shade bid to account for information in winning

- **Auctions and IO:**
  - Bertrand pricing as auction: p(cᵢ) = C_max/n + ((n-1)/n)cᵢ
  - Asymmetric bidders: Incumbent vs. entrant dynamics

### Chapter 24: Strategic Commitments and International Trade
- **Strategic subsidies (Brander-Spencer 1985):**
  - Government subsidizes domestic "national champion"
  - In Cournot duopoly, optimal subsidy: s* = (A - c)/4
  - Achieves Stackelberg leader output: q(s*) = (A - c)/2

- **Strategic tariffs with scale economies:**
  - Tariff raises foreign firm's cost
  - Scale effects amplify advantage (Krugman 1986)
