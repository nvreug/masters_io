However, an alternative derivation of (24.8) is perhaps more insightful if more involved.
As we know from Chapter 9, any increase in _s_ will shift firm _a_ ’s best response curve out
and slide it along the best response curve of firm _b_ . Symmetry and equation (24.2) tell us
that response curve has slope −0.5, i.e., a small increase in _qa_ will lead to a reduction of 0.5
units in _qb_ . Since the demand curve has slope 1, this implies a consequent price increase
                  of 0.5. Thus, as a first approximation, a small unit increase in _qa_ will raise the price at
which all existing _qa_ units sell by 0.5, so that the marginal revenue from that small increase
is approximately 0.5 _qa_ . The marginal cost of subsidizing one more unit is of course just
_s_ . The optimal subsidy _s_ [∗] balances the marginal revenue against the marginal cost. With
_qa_ _(A_ _c_ 2 _s)/_ 3, the optimal subsidy must therefore satisfy:
=  - +



_s_ [∗] = 0.5 _qa_ = _[(A]_ [ −] _[c]_ 6 [ +][ 2] _[s)]_



(24.9)
6



From which it follows that _s_ [∗] _[A]_ [ −] _[c]_
= 4



From which it follows that _s_ [∗] just as in equation (24.8).
= 4

Two key results may now be derived. First, substitution of the optimal subsidy value _s_ [∗]



from equation (24.8) into the net benefit _NB(s)_ function of equation (24.7) quickly reveals
that when done optimally, the net benefit is positive and equal to



_NB(s_ [∗] _)_ _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_ [2] (24.10)
= 72





Second, substitution of the optimal subsidy _s_ [∗] into equation (24.3) shows that firm _a_ ’s
output _qa(s_ [∗] _)_ is:

_qa(s_ [∗] _)_ = _[A]_ [ −] 2 _[c]_ (24.11)


This last expression should look familiar to you. It is the output that would be chosen by a
Stackelberg leader when both firms have identical unit costs. As we emphasized in Chapter
12 (recall Dixit’s (1980) model of entry deterrence), however, achieving the Stackelberg
leader first-mover advantage requires the ability to credibly commit to that higher output
level. This is the insight of the strategic trade literature. Government intervention—here in
the form of a subsidy—acts as such a commitment in a manner that Alexander Hamilton
would have readily understood. As a result of that subsidy and the production commitment
it enables firm _a_ to make, the additional profit more than covers the subsidy cost and overall
benefits are positive for Country A.


B. Demand in the market is described by the equation _P_ = 1000 − _Q_ . Each firm has a
constant marginal cost of _c_ = 400.

a. What is the Nash equilibrium output and profit of each firm in the absence of any
subsidy?
b. If Country A subsidizes its “national champion” optimally, what is i) firm A’s profit?
ii) the cost of the subsidy? and iii) the net gain from the subsidy?

24.1.2 Strategic Tariffs and Scale/Scope Economies


The foregoing analysis of a strategic subsidy captures much in the spirit of Alexander
Hamilton’s goal of assisting the domestic industry. However, because he was interested in
raising tax revenue and paying off the debt, Hamilton focused more on protective tariffs to
encourage the expansion of domestic manufacturing. As it turns out, the use of tariffs as the
strategic weapon actually adds a further dimension to the analysis that is worth exploring.

We again assume a Cournot model with two firms, firm _a_ and firm _b_, from Country A
and Country B, respectively, and assume that each country functions as a separate market,
perhaps because the goods produced for A and B are not identical. That is, the firms are
competing for the Country A widget market in which demand is described by _Q_ = _A_ - _P_,
and the Country B gadget market, in which demand is again described by _Q_ = _A_ - _P_ . To
simplify the impact of a tariff, we also assume that each firm has a unit cost of not _c_ but _c_ - _s_ .

From our earlier work, it is straightforward to work out the equilibrium in each case.
Within each country the firms _a_ and _b_ produce and earn profit as shown in Table 24.3
below.

Firm _a_ sells _(A_  - _c_ + _s)/_ 3 in Country A and also sells _(A_  - _c_ + _s)/_ 3 in Country B. The
same is true for firm _b_ . Now suppose that Country A puts a tariff of _s_ per unit on imports.
Effectively, this translates into a cost increase of _s_ for firm _b_ on all units sold in Country A.
In other words, firm _b_ now has a cost of _c_ per unit within Country A. From the previous
section, we know that this results in a reduction in firm _b_ ’s output and profit in Country A
and a corresponding rise in these values for firm _a_ . If this were the end of the story, the new
output and profit configuration would be as described in Table 24.4 below.

The outcome described in the table above implies that the tariff does not have any
impact on the rivalry between the two firms in Country B. In that country, the two firms
produce and earn profit just as before. The tariff so far affects only the market outcomes in
Country A.

As Krugman (1986) shows, however, the foregoing results change if there are scale or
scope economies. The reduction in firm _b_ ’s output in Country A is also a reduction in its
total output globally. If there are scale or scope effects such that a firm’s unit cost rises as
its output across the two markets declines, the production decline for firm _b_ will mean that
its unit cost is no longer _c_ - _s_ but something higher. Likewise, the expansion in firm _a_ ’s
output may allow it to achieve even lower costs.

To work out the complete equilibrium would require that we fully specify the nature of
the scale or scope effects and determine the Cournot equilibrium as those effects grow or
diminish. Instead we adopt a convenient short cut here and simply assume that scale effects
are exhausted for firm _a_ so that its unit cost remains _c_ - _s_, but that as the result of its output
reduction firm _b_ does experience a cost rise to _c_ per unit in both countries. The consequent
output and profit levels are shown in Table 24.5 below.

A comparison of Tables 24.5 and 24.3 shows that firm _a_ ’s total profit has increased by
6 _s(A_ - _c)_ + 11 _s_ [2], while total output in Country A has fallen by 2 _s/_ 3. Given that aggregate
demand in Country A is _Q_ = _A_ - _P_, this means that 2 _s/_ 3 measures the rise in price in
Country A. Hence, Country A suffers a consumer surplus loss of 2 _s_ [2] _/_ 9. However, firm _a_
now earns [2 _s(A_ - _c)_ + 3 _s_ [2] ] _/_ 9 more in profit in Country B than it did previously. This
is more than enough to compensate for the domestic welfare loss. Moreover, there is the
additional profit firm _a_ now earns in its home country that previously went to firm _b_ . The
tariff does more than protect domestic production. It acts as a commitment that firm _a_ will
be advantaged in Country A and therefore larger globally than its rival firm _b_ . It is therefore
a commitment to insure that firm _a_ will have a lower unit cost than firm _b_ . This leads firm
_b_ to lose additional market share and profit to firm _a_ in _both_ countries A and B.”

The commitment role of the tariff merits emphasis. As Hamilton implicitly understood,
the tariff allows Country A to insure that firm _a_ will operate on a relatively large scale in its
home market. Because that market is an oligopoly, that commitment acts as a non-negotiable
claim for a larger share of the domestic oligopoly profit. Credibility of the commitment is
cemented by the fact that it also prevents firm _b_ from enjoying scale economies. Hence firm
_a_ is also advantaged in Country B further offsetting the tariff cost.

of $2 per unit, the loss in production raises firm _b_ ’s unit cost to $14 everywhere. Determine
the net change in consumer and producer surplus in Country A as a result of the tarrif.


24.1.3 Strategic R&D Subsidies


One problem with either the direct subsidy or the tariff policy just described is that each
violates the international trade laws negotiated by the World Trade Organization (WTO)
to promote free, unfettered trading arrangements. As a result, they are likely to lead to
punishments and trade sanctions that will undermine their net benefits. We return to consider
the WTO and trading policies later. At this point, we wish to explore an alternative and
slightly less direct route to assist the domestic firm, namely, to subsidize its R&D.

There are many ways to subsidize R&D. Large grants to universities and hospitals, the
provision of information to farmers about crop rotation and other techniques, and the award
of production grants that permit firms to work their way down the learning curve may all be
viewed as government support for the creation and dissemination of technical information.
While each of these may be justified for other reasons, there can be little doubt that each may
also provide advantages to domestic firms. American pharmaceutical and bioengineering
firms likely benefitted from the research support provided to university medical schools and
faculty. American farmers clearly benefitted from the Agriculture Department’s Extension
Service, and Boeing’s strong position in the aircraft market may well reflect the head start
it received from developing aircraft for the US military. The same assertions could be made
regarding firms in most other countries as well. In general, R&D subsidization of some sort
is common. Indeed, this is what makes R&D subsidization so difficult to monitor as an
unfair method of trade competition. It is difficult to distinguish policies meant purely to give
a domestic firm an advantage over foreign rivals from policies to promote economic growth.

Modeling the impact of a strategic R&D subsidy requires modeling the impact of R&D on
the firm’s production technology as well as the cost of doing that R&D. This is complicated
and we save the details for the Appendix. However, the intuition can be readily understood.

We will continue to assume a Cournot duopoly with quantity competition. When it comes
to R&D, we will now make the further assumption that while R&D spending works to
lower a firm’s unit production cost _c_, this effect is subject to diminishing returns. As a
result, the R&D cost of reducing _c_ grows quickly as one tries to push it lower and lower
with more and more R&D. In this plausible scenario, the R&D spending choices for the
two firms are, like their output choices, strategic substitutes. As _firm a_ increases its R&D
spending _xa_, firm _b_ ’s best response is to curtail its own _xb_ .

The market outcome is now described by Figures 24.1 and 24.2. In the first of these,
the best response function for each firm in terms of its R&D is shown by the heavy black
curves. In the absence of any subsidies, the Nash equilibrium would be where these curves
intersect at A. However, if Country A subsidizes firm _a_ ’s R&D, its best response curve
shifts out as shown by the dashed curve, and the new equilibrium now moves to B. Notice
that in this equilibrium, firm _b_ now does less R&D.

Because the subsidy changes the R&D level at both firm _a_ and firm _b_, it also alters
their unit costs and, hence, their equilibrium outputs. Figure 24.2 illustrates these effects.

**Figure 24.2**
Competition in output levels


In the absence of any subsidy, the R&D equilibrium at A in Figure 24.1 would yield
symmetric research efforts and therefore identical unit costs at the two firms. In Figure 24.2,
the resultant Cournot equilibrium is where the two heavy black best response functions
intersect at _A_ [′] . The subsidy though has a double barrel effect of both lowering firm _a_ ’s
cost and, by way of less R&D, raising firm _b_ ’s cost. This is shown in Figure 24.2 by
the outward shift of firm _a_ ’s best response function and the inward shift of firm _b_ ’s best
response function. The result is a two-fold assault on firm _b_ ’s output, which now shrinks
dramatically as the equilibrium in Figure 24.2 moves from _A_ [′] to _B_ [′] .


24.2 TRADE AGREEMENTS AS COMMITMENT DEVICES


We have now worked through three separate cases in which a country may enjoy net
gains by intervening in international markets so as to advantage the domestic firm vis-`a-vis
foreign rivals. A natural question that arises in this context is why Country B should not


Strategic Commitments and International Trade 669


react to Country A’s intervention by doing the same thing. What happens if both impose
tariffs or subsidize domestic firms?

Essentially, these questions point to a deeper level game than the ones we have so
far considered. This is the game between the governments of each country in which the
variable of strategic choice is either a tariff, or production cost subsidy, or R&D subsidy. In
general, the Nash equilibrium of this game has a prisoners’ dilemma in which both countries
subsidize or impose tariffs to a greater extent than they would if they played cooperatively.
Absent any formal agreement mechanism, however, cooperative play is not feasible.

This is where international trade agreements and organizations such as the WTO have
become important. By joining such institutions, the member countries pledge themselves
not to give in to the short-run temptation of intervening on behalf of domestic firms. Two
features make this commitment more credible. First, such organizations act to police and to
punish members who violate their free trade promises. In this view, organizations such as
the WTO may be analyzed using the same logic that we used to discuss the ability of firms
to cooperate in Chapter 14. The necessary elements are an ability to detect violations and
then to punish them. In this respect, one feature that is helpful in the case of the WTO is
that while violations are typically directed by one country at another, punishment is meted
out by all members. Thus, if the United States imposes tariffs or intervenes to aid domestic
producers of LCD screens against the Korean giant, Samsung, and if this action is deemed
a violation of the WTO agreement, the penalty may include restrictions on US exports to
all member nations and not just South Korea.

A second source of credibility is that to some extent, joining the international agreement
insulates domestic politicians from political pressure. When pressured by domestic industry
representatives for unfair assistance, the domestic authorities can respond by saying that
while they would like to help, the rules of membership are clear and “their hands are tied.”
The strengths of such commitment devices should not be minimized. A central feature of
the US Constitution was that it reserved jurisdiction over interstate commerce to the federal
government. Prior to the Constitution’s adoption, when the US government was organized
under the Articles of Confederation, the states had considerable power to levy taxes and
otherwise hinder the products of other states in an effort to protect their own. The result
was a nightmare web of barriers to trade and inefficiencies as each state tried to protect its
industry and raise revenue to pay its debts by taxing the products of out-of-state producers.
In this light, the interstate commerce clause may be seen as a conscious effort to bind
the states more fully to their commitment to trade freely with each other. Perhaps it is no
wonder then that it was that student of commitment, Alexander Hamilton, who was one of
the leading advocates for the Constitution’s adoption.


24.3 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: STRATEGIC SUBSIDIES AT
THE CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD


We have seen that strategic intervention by a government can, in the case of imperfectly
competitive international markets, serve as a commitment that enhances the competitive
position of domestic firms. In turn, the additional profit that this allows the domestic firm(s)
to earn can more than offset the cost of the intervention, e.g., more than offset the cost of
a subsidy to production or research. A compelling example of such intervention may be
the case of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), as work by Hamilton and Stiegert (2002)
reveals.


670 Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment



![](/Users/nicholasvreugdenhil/ASU Dropbox/Nicholas Vreugdenhil/masters_io_2026/external/peppall_textbook_chunks/markdown/peppall_textbook_chunk28_p676-700_images/peppall_textbook_chunk28_p676-700.pdf-6-2.png)





The CWB is an example of State Trading Enterprise (STE). STE’s are either explicitly
government agencies or quasi-public agencies closely associated with government policy
designed to control either exports or imports or both of a particular set of commodities.
In the case of the CWB, the central commodity is durum wheat for which the CWB
has total monopoly power. In brief, the CWB buys wheat from Canadian producers at
a specified price _w_ and then acts as the sole exporter of wheat from Canada to the
rest of the world. Canadian producers are expected to meet the production demands of
the CWB at price _w_, knowing that the CWB will subsequently distribute the profits
from its sales back to the producers based primarily on each producer’s share of the
production.

A moment’s thought will reveal how the CWB payment system may be structured to
achieve precisely the subsidy effect discussed earlier in this chapter. By setting _w_ below


Strategic Commitments and International Trade 671


marginal cost, the input price to the CWB is lowered. The agency’s best response function
shifts out accordingly with the result that Canadian wheat exports expand while those of
other producers shrink. If the market behaves as in our earlier analysis and if _w_ is chosen
correctly, then the resultant increase in total profit is more than enough to compensate wheat
producers for their initial selling at a price below marginal cost.

Hamilton and Stiegert (2002) collect data on wheat prices ($ _/_ ton) and quantities for the
period 1972 through 1995, which they use to estimate a model of the world wheat market
with more general demand and supply behavior and more than two firms. The underlying
intuition of the model, though, is the same as outlined above. These data allow the authors to
calculate estimates of both the actual implicit subsidy and the theoretically optimal subsidy
in each of the twenty-four years. How well these two values match then provides a test of
the extent to which the CWB structured its payments to Canadian wheat producers so as to
maximize their net surplus.

We need to note first, however, that our derivation of the optimal implicit subsidy _s_
was based on a standard assumption reflected in all Cournot best response functions of
which equation (24.2) is a good example. The standard Cournot best response function
for any firm is derived under the assumption that the output of the rivals is given, i.e.,
that the firm’s action will not induce further responses. Another way to say this is that in
the standard Cournot game, each firm believes that a change in its own output will map
one-for-one into a change in total market output as no other firms will react. In turn, this
means that the optimal subsidy we derived is predicated on the assumption that for any one
firm _�Q_ _�qi_ . Of course, this may not be the case. In the wheat market, for example, the
=
CWB may anticipate that its best response will induce further output changes from rivals.
This means that any test of the CWB price-setting is really a test that of the assumption
that _�Q_ = _�qC_ as well as a test of strategic subsidization given that assumption. For
this reason, Hamilton and Stiegert (2002) structure their analysis so that it also yields an
estimate of the parameter _λ_ in the equation:


_�Q_ _λ�qc_ (24.12)
=


Here, _λ_ is the conjectural variations parameter described in Chapter 9. It measures how
much the CWB conjectures the production of other exporters will respond to the CWB’s
choices.

The key results of the Hamilton and Stiegert (2002) analysis are shown in Table 24.6,
below. We first show the estimated value of the conjectural variations parameter _λ_, along
with its standard error. We then display the observed and estimated optimal value of the
subsidy for each year in the data.

The first thing to notice is that Hamilton and Stiegert (2002) estimate of the conjectural
variations parameter _λ_ is very close to 1. In fact, the hypothesis that it is equal to 1 cannot
be rejected by the data implying less than fully independent production choices. Thus, we
can now turn to comparing the observed subsidy against the hypothetically optimal subsidy
assuming that _λ_ is in fact 1 just as the Cournot model predicts.

In this respect, note that while the observed unit subsidy _s_ and the optimal unit subsidy
_s_ [∗] are notably different in a few specific years, they are generally close in most years and
also close—judging by the mean and the median—over the entire twenty-four year sample
period. Hamilton and Stiegert (2002) test this similarity further using nonparametric tests
such as the Wilcoxen signed rank and Spearman coefficient of rank tests that do not assume

the underlying distributions to be normal. Here, again, they cannot reject the null hypothesis
that _s_ and _s_ [∗] are the same over the sample period.

In short, the evidence in Hamilton and Stiegert (2002) is broadly consistent with the view
that during the years 1972 through 1995, the CWB structured its payments to Canadian
wheat producers so as to subsidize exports implicitly and thereby to appropriate additional
rent or surplus from the world wheat market. The observed annual subsidy implicit in the
initial below-market price to wheat producers is close to the estimated optimal value each
year. It therefore appears that the behavior of the CWB in these years is exactly what
strategic trade theory predicts. [2] The implication, then, is that while Canadian consumers
may have been hurt by higher prices, the gains to Canadian wheat farmers and to the CWB
may have been enough to more than offset consumers’ loss.


2 It is important that the analysis ends in 1995 as that is about the time that the World Trade Organization
emerged along with stricter rules on the behavior of State Trading Enterprises.


Strategic Commitments and International Trade 673



**Summary**


Threats or promises can only be effective if the
threats are credible, i.e., part of a subgame perfect strategy. In many cases, this credibility can
only be obtained by making some commitment
that binds the player to carrying out that threat
or promise in the event that a rival takes the
action that the threat or promise was designed to
prevent. Commitment is the key to credibility.

International trade is an area in which understanding the role of commitment can have dramatic implications for public policy. In particular,
the economist’s traditional admonition that tariffs
and other trade interventions will be detrimental
to domestic welfare may be overturned when one
allows for imperfect competition and therefore
a role for strategic commitment. Imperfect completion and economies of scale and scope offer a
role for the strategic use of trade barriers and subsidies to domestic firms that enable them to claim

Such tactics effectively commit the domestic firm
to an aggressive strategy that often results in a
gain similar to a first-mover advantage.

Unfortunately, other countries will likely pursue the same policies and the non-cooperative
outcome of this game between nations will typically exhibit a prisoners’ dilemma feature in
which both countries are worse off than if neither
had intervened. In this light, trade institutions
like the WTO can be seen as a mechanism by
which countries truly commit to their free trade
promises. Yet this effort may ultimately trigger retaliation. The success achieved by the US
adoption of the interstate commerce clause and
by institutions such as the WTO suggests that a
commitment to permit free competition may be
the best policy both in theory and in practice.

## **Formal Analysis of Research Subsidies** **& International Trade**

Here, we present formally the strategic subsidy model originally due to Spencer and Brander
(1983). We again assume a Cournot duopoly in which there is now just one international
market with inverse demand _P_ = _A_ - _Q_ . The output and profit of firm _a_ and firm _b_ initially
are:



_qa_ = _[(A]_ [ −] [2] _[c]_ 3 _[a]_ [ +] _[ c][b][)]_




_[c][a]_ [ +] _[ c][b][)]_

3 ; _qb_ = _[(A]_ [ +] _[ c][a]_ 3 [ −] [2] _[c][b][)]_




_[b]_ (24.A1)

3



_πa_ = _[(A]_ [ −] [2] _[c]_ 9 _[a]_ [ +] _[ c][b][)]_ [2]




_[a]_ [ +] _[ c][b][)]_ [2]

9 ; _πb_ = _[(A]_ [ +] _[ c][a]_ 9 [ −] [2] _[c][b][)]_ [2]




_[b]_ (24.A2)

As in the Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1980) model (Chapter 20), each firm’s unit cost _c_ is
a function of its R&D spending _x_, i.e., _c_ _c(x)_, with _c_ [′] _(xa) <_ 0 and _c_ [′′] _(xa) <_ 0. We
=
therefore rewrite equations (24.A1) and (24.A2) as follows:



_qa_ = [[] _[A]_ [ −] [2] _[c(x]_ 3 _[a][)]_ [ +] _[ c(x][b][)]_ []]




_[a][)]_ [ +] _[ c(x][b][)]_ []]

3 ; _qb_ = [[] _[A]_ [ +] _[ c(x][a]_ 3 _[)]_ [ −] [2] _[c(x][b][)]_ []]




_[b]_ (24.A3)

3



_πa_ = [[] _[A]_ [ −] [2] _[c(x][a]_ 9 _[)]_ [ +] _[ c(x][b][)]_ []][2]




_[)]_ [ +] _[ c(x][b][)]_ []][2]

9 - _xa_ ; _πb_ = [[] _[A]_ [ +] _[ c(x][a][)]_ 9 [ −] [2] _[c(x][b][)]_ []][2]



9 _[b]_ - _xb_ (24.A4)



Because each firm’s unit cost, output, and profit depends on its R&D spending, that
spending is the ultimate strategic variable. Differentiating equation (24.A4) with respect


Strategic Commitments and International Trade 675


to _xa_ yields the following first-order condition, which implicitly defines _a_ ’s best R&D
response function:

[ _A_  - 2 _c(xa)_ + _c(xb)_ ] _c_ [′] _(xa)_ = − [9] 4 (24.A5)


The slope of the implicit best response function _dxa/dxb_ is:



_dxa_
_dxb_




    - _c_ [′] _(xa)c_ [′] _(xb)_ (24.A6)
= [ _A_ 2 _c(xa)_ _c(xb)_ ] _c_ [′′] _(xa)_ 2[ _c_ [′] _(xa)_ ] [2]
  - +   


The numerator of equation (24.A6) is definitely negative. The denominator will be
positive so long as _c_ [′′] _(xa)_ is relatively large, which we assume here. Hence, the best
response function for firm _a_ (and by symmetry firm _b_ ) slopes downward in a curve as
shown in Figure 24.1. The positions of the output best response functions, shown in
Figure 24.2 depend on the unit cost of each firm and therefore the R&D equilibrium. An
R&D subsidy in Country A, shifts out firm _a_ ’s best R&D response and commits the firm
to a level of R&D that it could not credibly threaten on its own. Because R&D levels are
strategic substitutes, firm _b_ now does less R&D. The resultant increase in the equilibrium
value of _xa_ lowers _ca_ . The decrease in _xb_ has the opposite effect for firm _b_ . Output market
equilibrium moves from _A_ [′] to _B_ [′] . Spencer and Brander (1983) show that the optimal R&D
subsidy is always positive.

2.1 .a. Profit Maximization implies MC = 2 _q_ + 10 = _P_ . Hence, _q_ = _(P_  - 10 _)/_ 2.
b. With 50 firms, horizontal summation of the individual marginal cost curves yields:
_Q_ _[S]_ = 50 _(P_    - 10 _)/_ 2 = 25 _P_    - 250.
c. Equilibrium: _P_ = $30 and _Q_ = 500.
d. _q_ = _(P_     - 10 _)/_ 2 = 10. Revenue = _Pq_ = $300. Total cost = 100 + _q_ [2] + 10 _q_ = $300.
Profit = 0.

2.2 .a. Inverse demand curve is: _P_ = _(_ 6,000 − 9 _Q)/_ 50. Hence, MR = 120 − _(_ 18 _Q/_ 50 _)_ =
120 − _(_ 9 _Q/_ 25 _)_ .
b. MC = 10 + _Q/_ 25. Equate with MR to obtain: _Q_ = 275. At this output, _P_ = $70.50.
c. Total revenue = $19,387.50. Each plant produces 5.5 units and incurs a total cost of
$185.25. Each plant earns a revenue of $387.75. Profit at each plant is $202.50.


2.3 .a. Consumer surplus is the area of the triangle above the equilibrium price but below
the demand curve = _(_ 1 _/_ 2 _)(_ $120 − $30 _)_ 500 = $22,500. Producer surplus is the area of
the triangle below the equilibrium price but above the supply curve = _(_ 1 _/_ 2 _)(_ $30 −
$10 _)_ 500 = $5,000. Total Surplus = $22,500 + $5,000 = $27,500. Note: Surplus is a
marginal concept. Producer fixed cost is not considered.
b. Total surplus falls by area of deadweight triangle. Height of triangle is given by reduction
in output which is 500 − 275 = 225. Marginal cost at _Q_ = 275 is $21. Base of triangle
is given by price less marginal = $70.50 − $21 = $59.50. So deadweight triangle has
area equal to: = _(_ 1 _/_ 2 _)(_ $49.50 _)_ 225 or $5,568.75. The new total surplus is the competitive
surplus less the deadweight loss = $27,500 − $5568.75 = $21,931.25.

2.4 .a. Efficiency requires _P_ = _MC_ . Marginal cost is $10. So, _P_ = $10 _(Q_ = 30 _)_ is efficient
outcome.
b. Profit maximization requires setting the monopoly price. Because inverse demand is
_P_ = 25 − _Q/_ 2 _,_ MR = 25 − _Q_ . Equating _MC_ and _MR_ then yields 10 = 25 − _Q_ or
_Q_ = 15 and _P_ = $17.5 is profit maximizing output and price.
c. Welfare loss is WL = 0.5 _(_ $17.5 − $10 _)(_ 30 − 15 _)_ = $56.25.

3.1 .a. CR4 [A] = 70%; CR4 [B] = 76%. HI [A] = 2698; HI [B] = 1660. Industry A has one firm that
dominates the industry. Industry B has five firms that control 90 percent of the production.
But these five firms may compete fiercely. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index seems to
better capture the greater potential for monopoly power in Industry A.

CR4 [A] = 80%; HI = 2992. Both measures rise.

4.1 In this case, we have discrete and not continuous changes in output. Hence we have to use the
average value of marginal cost at output 11. This is calculated as the average of the marginal
cost of increasing output from 10 to 11 units ($137) and the marginal cost of increasing output
from 11 to 12 units ($165), which is just $151. Average or unit cost at 11 units is equal to
$1407 _/_ 11 = $127.91. Hence, _S_ = _AC/MC_ = $127.91 _/_ 151 = 0.847 ≈ 0.85.

4.2 .a. _AC_ = _TC/q_ = 50 _/q_ + 2 + 0.5 _q. AC(q_ = 4 _)_ = 16.5; _AC(q_ = 8 _)_ = 12.25;
_AC(q_ = 10 _)_ = 12; _AC(q_ = 12 _)_ = 12.167; _AC(q_ = 15 _)_ = 12.833.
b. _MC_ = _�TC_ per unit change. For decreases: _�TC_ = 50 + 2 _q_ + 0.5 _q_ [2]     - [50 + 2 _(q_     1 _)_ + 0.5 _(q_     - 1 _)_ [2] ] = 2 + _q_     - 0.5. For increases: _�TC_ = 50 + 2 _(q_ + 1 _)_ + 0.5 _(q_ + 1 _)_ [2]     
[50 + 2 _q_ + 0.5 _q_ [2] ] = 2 + _q_ + 0.5. The average of these two value is 2 + _q_ .
c. _S >_ 1 for _q <_ 10; _S_ = 1 for _q_ = 10; _S <_ 1 for _q >_ 10.

5.1 .a. Total moviegoers is the sum of daytime and evening moviegoers. Note that we assume
the price is the same in the daytime and in the evening. This allows us to derive
an overall demand function for daytime and evening, which is _Q_ Total 100 10 _P_ D
140 10 _P_ E 240 20 _P_ . The monopolist maximizes the profit function = _�_     - _Q(P_ + _c)_

5.3 Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus (profit). Consumer surplus
is the total amount “saved” by all consumers who paid less than they were willing to pay for
the movie. Geometrically, on a graph of price and quantity in the movie market, consumer
surplus is the triangle bounded on the left by the y-axis (the line _Q_ = 0), on top by the demand
curve, and on the bottom by the price curve ( _P_ = _P_ ).



In the non-discriminatory market, the theater’s profit _�_ = 405. Inverse demand curves are
_P_ D 10 _Q_ D _/_ 10 and _P_ E 14 _Q_ E _/_ 10. From these curves it is clear that the reservation
price of the consumers with greatest willingness to pay in the daytime and evening markets = - = are 10 and 14, respectively. The consumer surplus is sum of the areas of the triangles
with heights _(_ 10 − 7.5 _)_ and _(_ 14 − 7.5 _)_ and bases 25 and 65. Total consumer surplus is



1 _/_ 2 _(_ 10 − 7.5 _)(_ 25 _)_ + 1 _/_ 2 _(_ 14 − 7.5 _)(_ 65 _)_ = 242.5. Total surplus is 405 + 242.5 = $647.5.



In the discriminatory market, consumer surplus is once again the sum of the consumer
surpluses in the daytime and evening markets. Total consumer surplus is1 _/_ 2 _(_ 14 − 8.5 _)(_ 55 _)_ = 212.5. Total surplus is 425 + 212.5 = 637.5, which is $10 less than the [1] _/_ 2 _(_ 10 − 6.5 _)(_ 35 _)_ +

non-discriminatory total surplus.

6.1 . a. Because the demand curve is linear, it must be the line that passes through the two
points, (5, $40) and (10, $25). The slope of this line is _(_ $40 − $25 _)/(_ 5 − 10 _)_ =
−3 _,_ so _P_ = −3 _Q_ + _b_ . Plug in a point and solve for _b_ to find the inverse demand
equation, _P_ = 55 − 3 _Q._ The reservation price of the consumer with the greatest
willingness to pay is $55, the price when quantity is 0. At this point, the good is
at its scarcest, so only the consumer with greatest willingness to pay will buy the
good.
b. We can think of total demand as being the sum of demand for a first unit and demand
for a second unit. Because every consumer is willing to pay $8 less for the second
unit, the demand curve for a second unit is just the demand for the first unit shifted
down by $8, or _P_ 47 3 _Q_ 2. Plugging in _P_ 34, we find 7 first units will be sold
=           - =
and 4.333 second units will be sold, for a total of 11.333 units sold.

6.2 . a. The price per ride should be set at marginal costs, which is _k_ + _c_ so _p_ = _k_ + _c_ . The
number of rides bought at this price is _q_ 1. The admission fee T should be set to
consumer surplus at this price _p_, which is the area under the demand curve and above
_k_ + _c_ .
b. The price per ride _p_ 0 at which price the number of rides bought is _q_ 2. The admission
=
fee should be set to consumer surplus at this price, which is the total area under the
demand curve.
c. In Policy A, the park’s profit per customer is T. The price per ride just covers costs. In
Policy B, the park’s profit per customer is T [′] minus the cost of _q_ 2 rides. However, the
cost of each ride is only _c_, because there is no need to issue tickets. Total profit will
be the area under the demand curve minus a box of dimensions _c_ by _q_ 2. Which policy
is better is uncertain without further information. Policy B gains profit whose area is
the trapezoid bounded by _c_, _k_ + _c_, and the demand function, but loses profit given by
the triangle above the demand curve and below _c_ .

b. If the number of high- and low-demand customers is the same, then for each highdemand customer there is one low-demand customer. Thus, for each pair, the profit is
profit from a low-demand package plus profit from a high-demand package. This sum
is greatest when the low-demand package has 4 units and the high-demand package
has 12 units, so that combined profit is $24 + $56 = $80.
c. For each high-demand customer, there are now two low-demand customers. We
want to pick the low-demand package to maximize 2 [∗] profit low + profit high. This is
maximized when the low-demand package has 6 units, so the profit from 2 low-demand
customers and 1 high-demand customer is $108.
d. From the table, the profit maximizing prices would be $54 for the low-demand package,
and $120 for the high-demand package. We want to know at what ratio the profit from
only selling the high-demand package exceeds that of selling the high- and low-demand
_N_ packages. This is equivalent to asking when $72Low _._ This equality reduces to _N_ High _/N_ Low _>_ 1.125. Therefore, the monopolist should [∗] _N_ High _>_ $44 [∗] _N_ High + $31.50 ×

7.1 He should locate in the middle, where he will have the greatest access to consumers.
Consumers will buy from Henry as long as the price plus the travel cost is less than the
reservation price, or _P_ + .5 _d <_ 10, where _d_ is the distance from Henry’s in tenths of a mile.
The marginal consumer will be located where _P_ + .5 _d_ = 10 _,_ or _d_ = 20 − 2 _P._ The number
of customers is just 2 _d_, because people come to Henry’s from both directions. However, 2 _d_
cannot exceed 21, because that is the maximum number of people in the town. Henry’s profit
is _�_ = 2 _d (P_     - _c)_ = 2 _(_ 20 − 2 _P )(P_     - 2 _)_ . To maximize profit, we set d _�/dP_ = 0 and solve
for _P_, which in this case is _P_ = $6. At this price, _d_ is 8 so the total number of customers
supplied is 16, and _�_ = $64.

With the mobile smithy, Henry can charge every customer their $10 reservation price, but
the travel cost of $0.75 per tenth of a mile cuts into his profits. Henry will visit consumers
as long as .75 [∗] _d_ + 2 _<_ 10, so _d_ = 10.67. This would imply Henry would service 21.33
customers, but because there are only 21 customers, Henry just serves everyone in the
town. He earns $10 in revenue from the person at his position, $9.25 from the two next
nearest consumers, $8.50 from the two second-nearest consumers _. . ._ giving him revenue
minus transport costs of $10.00 + 2 _(_ 9.25 + 8.50 + 7.75 + _. . ._ + 2.50 _)_ = $127.50 and profit
of $125.50 − $42 = $85.50. The profit from traveling is clearly greater than the profit from
staying in the same place, so Henry should travel.

7.2 .a. The demand curve for a given quality is a line with slope −1 _/z_, crossing the y-axis at

output is _Q_ = 2. For _z_ = 2 _, P_ = 4 − _Q/_ 2 and _C_ = 4. Profit _�_ = _Q(_ 4 − _Q/_ 2 _)_      - 4.
The profit maximizing output is _Q_ = 4. For _z_ = 3 _, P_ = 4 − _Q/_ 3 and _C_ = 9. Profit

and the cable operator makes profit _�_ = 11 [∗] 3 − 3 [∗] 3 = 24. If the price for the Disney Channel is $15, then students, schools, and young adults subscribe, and profit is

_�_ = 15 [∗] 3 − 3 [∗] 3 = 36.
b. The bundled service is the Basic Service and the Disney Channel together. Notice that
the reservation prices for the bundled service for students, families, hotels, schools,
young adults, and pensioners, are respectively $20 _,_ $20 _,_ $20 _,_ $20 _,_ $17 _,_ and $17. Thus,
the price of the bundle should be $20. The prices of individual items must be $17, so
that young adults and pensioners will still buy the individual services. The profit from
mixed bundling is _�_ = 20 [∗] 4 + 17 [∗] 2 − 8 [∗] 3 − 2 [∗] 3 = $84. Students, families, hotels, and
schools buy the bundled service. Young adults only buy Disney, and pensioners only buy
Basic. The cable company is clearly better off with the mixed bundling strategy.
c. The best that the cable operator can do with mixed bundling is price the bundle at $20 and
the individual services at $17, as in part (b). This generates zero profit from sales of the
bundle, because the marginal cost of the bundle is $20 and $7 each from sales of Disney to
young adults and Basic Service to pensioners, giving a total profit from mixed bundling of
$14. The best that the cable operator can do is price the Basic Service at $14, selling this
to hotels and pensioners, and the Disney Channel at $15, selling this to students, schools
and young adults. Profit from this strategy is _�_ = 14 [∗] 2 − 2 [∗] 10 + 15 [∗] 3 − 3 [∗] 10 = $23 _._



8.2 If film is sold separately from the camera, then the price charged to low- and high-demand
customers must be the same. We can find the overall demand _Q_ Total _Q_ High _Q_ Low
28 − 2 _P_ . Notice the profit is composed of two parts: Profit from the film and profit from leasing = + =
the camera. The profit from film is _�_ film 1000 [∗] _(_ 16 _P )(P_ 2 _)_ 1000 [∗] _(_ 12 _P )(P_ 2 _)_ .
The fee for leasing the camera is what would have been consumer surplus for the low-demand =    -    - +    -    customers, but all 2,000 customers now have to pay it, so _�_ camera 2000 [∗] [1] _/_ 2 _(_ 12 _P )_ [2] . Total
profit is _�_ = 1000 _(_    - _P_ [2] + 8 _P_ + 88 _)_, so d _�/dP_ = 1000 _(_ −2 _P_ + = 8 _)_ = 0, and _P_    - = 4.



With the 8- and 14-shot varieties, there is no charge for film and all profit comes from the
lease. The 8-shot camera lease must be priced so as to leave no surplus for the low-demand
customers but be less attractive to high-demand customers than the 14-shot variety. Likewise,
the 14-shot variety must not generate surplus for the low-demand customers, and must be
attractive to high-demand customers. When the low-demand customers take 8 shots, they are
effectively paying a price of $4 per shot, and are receiving $32 in surplus. Thus the price of
the 8 shot camera should be $32 + $4 [∗] 8 = $64. At this price, all of the consumer surplus
is extracted from the low-demand customers and turned into profit. However, high-demand
customers can buy this package and get $8 [∗] 8 + $32 − $64 = $32 of surplus, because 8
shots are worth $8 apiece to a high-demand customer. That means that the 14-shot camera
must be priced to leave high-demand customers with at least $32 of surplus if they are
to choose it over the 8-shot. 14 shots are worth $2 apiece to the high-demand customer,
and after paying $2 [∗] 14 they also get $98 of consumer surplus. Therefore, the price for
the 14-shot should be just less than $98 + $2 [∗] 14 − $32 = $94, so the 14-shot should be
priced at $93.99 to ensure the high-demand customers will buy. Notice that the high-demand
customer still makes $32.01 of consumer surplus from buying the 14-shot camera. Profit is

_�_ = 1000 [∗] _(_ $64 − 8 [∗] $2 _)_ + 1000 [∗] _(_ $93.99 − 14 [∗] $2 _)_ = $113,990 _._

Prices are strategic complements. With sequential price setting, the firms can exploit this

16.89 firms have to merge. That is, at least seventeen firms must merge. This can be double
checked. If sixteen firms merge this leaves five firms in the industry, each with profit of
$277.78, whereas aggregate profit of these firms pre-merger is 16 [∗] 22.67 = $362.81. By
contrast if seventeen firms merge this leaves four firms in the industry, each with profit of
$400 whereas aggregate profit of these firms pre-merger is 17 [∗] 22.67 = $385.49.

Chapter 16


16.1 The retailer’s marginal revenue curve is _MR_ = 3,000 − _Q_ and the retailer maximizes profit
by equating MR and MC, giving _r_ = 3,000 − _Q,_ which is also the manufacturer’s demand
curve. If the retailer has additional marginal costs of _c_ _[D]_ then profit maximization gives
3,000 − _Q_ = _r_ + _c_ _[D]_, which gives _r_ = _(_ 3,000 − _c_ _[D]_ _)_    - _Q_ as the manufacturer’s demand
curve.

total profit = ; = = $700. ; = ; = = ; = ; = ;
b. If WM and WW merge, then their cost of combined operation is $15. Demand curve facing
merged firm is _W_ W 95 2 _Q_ . Profit maximization implies: 95 4 _Q_ 15 _Q_ 20.
Wholesale price to retailer falls to $55. Price charged to consumers falls to $80. Profit of the =       -       - = ⇒ =
merged firm is _(_ 55 − 15 _)_ × 20 = $800. Profit of the retailer is _(_ 80 − 60 _)_ × 20 = $400.
Total profit has increased, the merged firm has greater profits and the retailer has greater
profits. Consumers are offered lower prices.

If WW and WR merge, WW will supply WR at marginal cost, which is 5 _wm_ . WR

then equates MR with MC giving 100 − 2 _Q_ = 10 + _wm_ giving the demand function for
WM of _wm_ 90 2 _Q_ . Equating MR with MC gives 90 4 _Q_ 10 or _Q_ 20. This
gives _wm_ = $50. Profit to WM is $800. The final product (retail) price is $80. Profit to −      - = =
the merged firm is $ = _(_ 80 − 10 − 50 _)_ × 20 = $400.
c. If all three firms merge, total cost of bringing good to market is $20. Merged firm faces retail
demand of _P_ = 100 − _Q_, hence, _MR_ = 100 − 2 _Q_ = 20 implies _Q_ = 40 and _P_ = 60.
Merged firm profit is: $1600 _>_ $1200 above.

16.3 .a. Suppose that WI sets a wholesale price of _w_ . GI maximizes profit by setting MC =
_w_ 0.1 + 0.75 _w_ = MR0.4 = _Qgn_ 1, so that − 2 _Qgb_ so _Qgn Qgb_ 1.625 = 0.45 −2.5 _ww/_ 2. TI maximizes profit by setting 0.1. This gives aggregate demand for WI +
of = _Q_ = 2.075 −      - 3 _w_ or _w_ = 2.075 = _/_ 3 − _Q/_ −3. Marginal revenue for WI is then MR =
2.075 _/_ 3 − 2 _Q/_ 3 and MC = 0.1. This gives profit maximizing total output _Q_ = 0.8875.
The wholesale price is _w_ = $0.396. Sales in Boston are 0.252 and in New York are
0.635. The price of gizmos in Boston is $0.748 and in New York is $0.623. Profits are:
WI = $0.263; GI = $0.063; TI = $0.081.
b. Suppose that WI sets a price _w_ b for widgets in Boston and _wn_ for widgets in New
York. GI sets MR 1 2 _Qgb_ MC 0.1 _w_ b, giving derived demand to WI of
_w_ b 0.9 2 _Qgb_ . Marginal revenue is =    - = = _MR_ + 0.9 4 _Qgb_ . Equating with MC of 0.1
gives = _Qgb_        - 0.2. The wholesale price is _w_ b = $0.5. The Boston gizmo price is $0.8. −
Profit of GI is $0.04. Profit of WI in Boston is $0.08. Similarly, derived demand for WI in = =
_Q_ New York is _n_ 0.8125. Wholesale price is $0.425. The New York gizmo price is $0.5875. Profit _wn_ = 0.75 − 0.4 _Qgn_ . Equating MR = 0.75 − 0.8 _Qn_ with MC = 0.1 gives
of TI is $0.051 and of WI from sales in New York is $0.264. Profit for WI increased and =
for TI and GI decreased.
c. Suppose that WI merges with GI in Boston. Widgets are supplied to GI at marginal
cost. GI equates MR 1 2 _Qgb_ MC 0.2, giving _Qgb_ 0.4. Price of gizmos in
Boston = $0.6, profit of the merged firm from Boston is $0.16, aggregate profit is $0.349. =       - = = =
Now suppose that WI merges with TI in New York. Widgets supplied to New York at
marginal cost. GI sets MR 0.75 0.4 _Qgn_ MC 0.2, giving _Qgn_ 1.375. Price of
Gizmos in New York $0.475. Profit of the merged firm is $0.458. So merger with TI is =      - = = =
preferred.
d. .i. Price in Boston rises and in New York falls. There is the opposite effect on consumer
surplus.
ii. Price and consumer surplus in Boston are unaffected. Price in New York falls and
consumer surplus increases.

16.4 .a. Competitive price is equal to marginal cost equals _r_ . Demand facing _WI_ is _r_ = 100 − _Q_,
so _MR_ = 100 − 2 _Q_ = 10 for profit maximization, or: _Q_ = 45 and _r_ = _P_ = $55. _WI_
profit is $2,025. Competitive retailers earn zero profit.
