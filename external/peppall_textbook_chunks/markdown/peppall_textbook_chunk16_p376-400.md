factor _ρ_ [∗] . Take our Bertrand model [11] and assume that there are _n_ identical firms in the
market. Each has profit _πm/n_ per period if it participates in the cartel and one-off total
monopoly profit _πm_ if it deviates. Deviation is not profitable, therefore, if

Note that if _n_ = 2, equation (14.8) gives the critical probability adjusted discount factor
_ρ_ [∗] _(_ 2 _)_ = 0.5 found earlier. If, by contrast, _n_ = 4 we have _ρ_ [∗] _(_ 4 _)_ = 0.75 and if _n_ = 10
we have _ρ_ [∗] _(_ 10 _)_ = 0.9. The intuition is easy to see. A firm in the cartel has to share the
cooperative profits with other cartel members. As a result, the returns to collusion fall as
the number of cartel members increases. By contrast, the returns to deviation typically do
not decrease with _n_ . Deviation is, in other words, more profitable as industry concentration
falls, i.e., as _n_ increases.

Hay and Kelley (1974) provide compelling support for this proposition that successful
cartels are more likely in concentrated industries. Their analysis of the prosecutions of
sixty-two cartels by the US Department of Justice from 1963–1972 is summarized in
Table 14.4 below. These data show a direct correlation between the four-firm concentration
ratio and the likelihood of cartel formation. [12]


_Significant Entry Barriers_


Easy entry undermines collusion because one of two things must happen when a new firm
enters a cartelized market. Either the entrant does not join the cartel and then is free to
compete against the cartel members forcing them to act more competitively, or the entrant
joins the cartel so that the cooperative profits must now be shared across more members.
In either case, the profitability of the cartel and therefore the motivation to maintain
cooperative behavior is diminished.


_Frequent and Regular Orders_


An industry in which firms receive infrequent orders will not be one conducive to
price-fixing. When orders are infrequent, it takes longer to punish a firm that cheats on the

cartel agreement and this obviously makes cheating more attractive. The math behind this
intuition is straightforward. The critical discount factor _ρ_ [∗] is a per period discount factor
(day, week, month _. . ._ ) that can be converted into an annual discount factor if we know
the relevant time period. The longer the time between orders, the higher the critical factor
will be. Imagine, for example, that orders are monthly and _ρ_ [∗] = 0.9. This is equivalent to
an annual discount factor of 0.9 [12] = 0.28. By contrast, if the period between orders is six
months, then the annual discount factor is 0.9 [2] = 0.81. Simply put, less frequent orders
implies that it takes longer to detect and punish a firm that cheats on the cartel agreement.

Irregularly sized orders also hamper collusive efforts. Take our Bertrand case, but suppose
that in the current period _(t_ 0 _)_ a large order is received that has profit _λπm_, with _λ >_ 1,
=
while all later profits are expected to return to _πm_ per period. A slightly modified equation
(14.8) gives the condition for the cartel to be self-sustaining in the face of this large order:



_ρ_
_λ_
+ _(_ 1 _ρ)_
   


_ρ_

_> λπm_ ⇒ _λ_ + _(_ 1 _ρ)_ _[> λ][n]_ (14.9)
       






_m_

_[π][m]_
_n_ _[(λ]_ [ +] _[ ρ]_ [ +] _[ ρ]_ [2][ +] _[ . . . )]_ [ =] _n_







_πm_



_n_



Solving this for _ρ_ gives the critical probability-adjusted discount factor


_λ(n_ 1 _)_
_ρ_ [∗] _(λ, n)_  - (14.10)
= 1 _λ(n_ 1 _)_
+       
Suppose that _n_ = 2 and _λ_ = 1 (no large orders). Then we have the earlier Bertrand
condition that the probability-adjusted discount factor necessary for collusion must exceed
_ρ(_ 1, 2 _)_ = 0.5. If, by contrast, _n_ = 2 and _λ_ = 2, then the critical discount factor necessary
for collusion is _ρ > ρ(_ 2, 2 _)_ = 2 _/_ 3. From equation (14.10), it is easy to show that the critical
discount factor _ρ_ [∗] _(λ, n)_ is increasing in the parameter _λ_ . Again, the intuition is clear. The
temptation to “steal” the profits from a one-time extra large order can be sufficiently great
to undermine what otherwise would have been a successful cartel. [13]


_Rapid Market Growth_


Cartels are more likely to be sustainable in growing markets and more likely to be unstable
in declining markets. Once again, the intuition is simple to see. Take the case where the
market is expected to grow over time. Deviation “early” in the market’s growth generates
profits as usual but now runs the risk of sacrificing the larger profits that the cartel will
generate as the market grows. The opposite argument applies, of course, if the market is
expected to decline over time. In this case, there is a stronger temptation to cheat and get
out now while the gains from doing so are reasonably good.


_Technological or Cost Symmetry_


Symmetry among industry firms in terms of technology and costs is another market feature
that can support cartel formation. Our earlier analysis suggests one reason why this should
be the case. When two firms have different costs it will be more difficult to formulate a
collusive agreement that they both find satisfactory. A firm is more able to formulate a
collusive agreement with a firm that “looks like” it does rather than one that does not. In


13 The same argument applies regarding demand uncertainty. With random demand, there will occassionally
be a positive demand shock and this is essentially equivalent to a large unexpected order.


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 367


addition, detailed negotiations over prices and market shares are much more straightforward
when firms are similar.

To see this point more formally, think of a Bertrand model in which each firm has a
marginal cost that rises with its output. At any price set by the cartel, the firms whose
marginal cost rises fastest will have the smallest output in the cartelized equilibrium. Let
there be _n_ firms in the cartel and denote the profit of firm _i_ as firm _i_ ’s share _si_ times the total
industry profit _πm_, i.e., as _siπm_, we can number the firms in decreasing order of their profit
For firmshares, so that _i_ to be willing to remain in the cartel the condition is: _s_ 1 ≥ _s_ 2 ≥ _s_ 3 ≥ _. . ._ ≥ _si_ ≥ _. . ._ ≥ _sn_ with, of course _s_ 1 + _s_ 2 + _. . ._ + _sn_ = 1.


_siπm(_ 1 + _ρ_ + _ρ_ [2] + _. . . )_ = _(_ 1 _siπmρ)_ _[> π][m]_ [ ⇒] _[s][i][ >]_ [ 1][ −] _[ρ]_ [ ⇒] _[ρ(s][i][) >]_ [ 1][ −] _[s][i]_ (14.11)
              
If all the firms have equal profit shares _si_ 1 _/n_ this simplifies to our “standard” Bertrand
case of equation (14.8). By contrast, when profit shares are different, the firm with the lowest =
profit share determines the binding probability-adjusted discount factor used in equation
(14.11). The smaller the share of the smallest firm, the higher that discount factor has to be
for collusion to be sustainable.


_Multi-Market Contact_


The fact that the same firms in an industry meet many times, i.e., the fact that the game
is repeated, is perhaps the crucial element facilitating collusion. It is therefore tempting to
suspect that a similar force is at work when rival firms compete in several distinct markets.
That is, competing against the same set of rivals in many markets at one point in time
is similar in some respect to competing against the same set of rivals in one market over
several periods. Cheating in one period risks punishment and the loss of cartel profits in
many subsequent periods, whereas cheating in one market could risk punishment and the
loss of cartel profits in the other markets. This intuition would suggest that multi-market
contact should again be a feature that facilitates collusion.

Unfortunately, the foregoing intuition is somewhat misleading because time is in fact
different from space. In the multi-market case a firm can cheat on all of its collusive
arrangements across different markets at the same point in time whereas it requires the
passage of time to cheat across different time periods. Nevertheless our intuition may well
be correct when the colluding firms have asymmetric market shares in the different markets
in which they compete. [14]

For example, suppose that two firms _A_ and _B_ each operate in two markets, 1 and 2.
Let aggregate cartel profits in each market be _πm_ per period. The profit share for firm
_A_ in each of these markets is _sA_ 1 and _sA_ 2, respectively, and we assume that _sA_ 1 _>_ 1 _/_ 2
whilewords, firm _sA_ 2 _< A_ 1 _/_ is the “large” firm in market 1 and firm2. Hence, for firm B _sB_ 1 = 1 − _sA_ 1 _<_ 1 _/ B_ 2 and is the “large” firm in market 2. _sB_ 2 = 1 − _sA_ 2 _>_ [1] _/_ 2. In other
As an example, _A_ might be a US firm and _B_ a European firm with market 1 being the US
and market 2 being the EU. To keep matters simple, further assume that the two firms have
the same time preferences and the same discount rates. In other words, they have the same
probability-adjusted discount factors. Finally, assume that in each market competition, if it
occurs, is in prices (Bertrand).


14 See Bernheim and Whinston (1990) for a more complete analysis of this insight.


368 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


If we treat the two markets separately, we know from our discussion in the previous
section that collusion is sustainable in market 1 only if the probability-adjusted discount
factor for each firm is greater than 1 − _sB_ 1 _>_ 1 _/_ 2 and in market 2 only if the probabilityadjusted discount factor for each firm is greater than 1 − _sA_ 2 _>_ [1] _/_ 2. Now consider the
two markets together. Take firm _A_ . Firm _A_ knows that if it deviates from the collusive
agreement in either market then it will be punished in both. If firm _A_ is contemplating
deviation it should deviate in both markets. In these circumstances, for deviation _not_ to be
profitable it must be that:



_(sA_ 1 _sA_ 2 _)πm(_ 1 _ρ_ _ρ_ [2] _. . . )_ _[(s][A]_ [1][ +] _[ s][A]_ [2] _[)π][m]_
+ + + + = _(_ 1 _ρ)_



_(_ 1 _[A]_ _ρ)_ _[m]_ ≥ 2 _πm_
 


⇒ _(sA_ 1 + _sA_ 2 _) >_ 2 _(_ 1 − _ρ)_ ⇒ _ρ(sA_ 1 _, sA_ 2 _)_ ≥ 1 − _[(s][A]_ [1][ +] 2 _[ s][A]_ [2] _[)]_




_[A]_ (14.12)

The analogous result applies for firm _B_ : _ρ(sB_ 1 _, sB_ 2 _)_ ≥ 1 − _[(s][B]_ [1][ +] 2 _[ s][B]_ [2] _[)]_



1
 - _[(s][B]_ [1][ +] 2 _[ s][B]_ [2] _[)]_



2 _ρ(sB_ 1 _, sB_ 2 _)_ ≥




_[B]_ .

2



To see the point about multi-market contact let’s make it simple and suppose that firm
_A_ has profit share _sA_ 1 _s_ in market 1 and 1 _s_ in market 2, with _s >_ 1 _/_ 2 to reflect
asymmetric positions. Analogously, firm = _B_ has profit share − _sB_ 1 1 _s_ in market 1 and _s_
in market 2. From (14.12) the cartel between firms _A_ and _B_ is sustainable when they operate = in both markets for any probability-adjusted discount factor greater than or equal to 1/2
(which is the standard Bertrand result again). However, the probability adjusted discount
factor would have to be greater than _s_, which by assumption is greater than 1/2, if the
firms collaborate in only one market. Multi-market contact can then support cooperation.
What is necessary is first, that the colluding firms have asymmetric positions in the markets
in which they jointly operate and second, that the asymmetry is reduced when all the
markets in which they compete our considered. In our example, each firm had a share in
excess of 1/2 in any one market. However, aggregated across both markets each firm has a
share of 1/2.



_Product Homogeneity_


The empirical evidence reported in Hay and Kelley (1974) and the conventional wisdom
of government authorities and the courts is that collusion is easier to sustain when the
cartel members produce homogeneous or nearly homogeneous products. Again, there is
an intuitive basis for this finding that stems from the complexity of the cartel agreement.
First, homogeneous products implies that a price-fixing cartel has to set and monitor only
one price, while by contrast, collusion in pricing differentiated products requires agreeing
on and monitoring a different price for each product. This raises a second issue. Setting
such a set of distinct prices when the products are differentiated requires that the cartel
members agree on just how much differentiation there really is. This is a far from simple
matter especially as its resolution will largely determine each firm’s share of the cartel
profits. Thirdly, punishment of deviation becomes more complex in a differentiated products
context. Should all non-deviating firms punish a deviant or should punishment be confined
to those whose products are the closest substitutes to the deviant’s product? If the latter,
can punishment be targeted to affect only the deviant firm or will there be spillover effects
to other members of the cartel?


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 369


It should be noted, however, that there is a potential advantage to product differentiation
for cartel sustainability. When the cartel members sell differentiated brands, each of which
has substantial brand loyalty, then the temptation to cheat falls. If consumers exhibit
considerable loyalty to their favorite brand then a deviant firm will find it hard to win much
business even when it secretly cuts its price. However, the weight of the evidence suggests
that cartels will be more successful—and therefore more likely—when they offer fairly
homogenous products.


_Other Factors_


Severalother importantfactors facilitate the formation and continuation of cartelagreements.
Monitoring the cartel agreement is easier when prices are _observable_ . Factors that facilitate
a cartel’s task of monitoring its members and responding to transgressions swiftly therefore
favor collusion. Regulations that require government agencies to publish the bids they have
received assist price monitoring by bid-rigging cartels. On private sector contracts, a _trade_
_association_ among the companies can help to facilitate collusive bidding behavior. The Hay
and Kelley study noted above (Table 14.4) provides evidence of the importance of such
trade associations in sustaining “large number” cartels.

In many consumer product markets _most-favored-customer_ and _meet-the-competition_
_clauses_ can help to maintain a price-fixing agreement among firms. [15] _Most-favored-_
_customer clauses_ guarantee that if the seller offers the same product to another buyer at a
lower price, the first buyer will receive a rebate equal to the difference in the two prices,
whereas _meet-the-competition clauses_ guarantee that a firm will match any lower price
offered by another seller. It might seem surprising to think of these clauses as being antirather than pro-competitive but a moment’s thought should indicate how they each can
work to maintain cartel discipline.

The _most-favored-customer clause_ severely restricts the temptation of any seller to
reduce its price because the price reduction has to be offered to all previous buyers as well.
Similarly, _meet-the-competition clauses_ make the process of detecting cheating particularly
effective, because now the firms offering these guarantees have vast numbers of unpaid
market watchers in the person of every consumer who has bought the product. At the same
time, such clauses effectively bind the hands of the firms that offer them.

If meet-the-competition clauses have anticompetitive effects why are consumers lured
by such guarantees? A price-matching clause is valuable to any one buyer who is assured
of getting the very best deal possible. However, because that buyer then becomes implicitly
a monitor of prices on behalf of the colluding firms, there is an externality to the buyer’s
purchase of which the buyer may be unaware. Moreover, such monitoring will lead to prices
being set higher (albeit identical) for all consumers. So, in fact, the equilibrium outcome
will be one in which all buyers are worse off.

Meet the competition clauses can also strengthen the trigger strategies that support
collusive behavior among firms. To get some idea as to just how powerful this effect can be,
consider a simple one-period pricing game between two firms. The payoff matrix shown in
Table 14.5 describes this prisoners’ dilemma game. The one-shot nature of the game leads
the firms to the only Nash equilibrium in which both firms price low. Now consider what
happens when we permit both firms to publish meet-the-competition guarantees that are


15 See Salop (1986) for more details on these competition clauses.

legally and instantaneously binding. [16] These guarantees render the off-diagonal price pairs
in Table 14.5 unattainable. There is no opportunity to undercut one’s cartel partner when
each firm has announced a meet-the-competition policy that goes into effect immediately.
Because the combinations of one firm pricing low and the other firm pricing high are
unattainable, neither firm has any incentive to deviate from the Price High policy. The cartel
works even in this simple one-period setting.

One way for a cartel in an unstable market to reinforce the trigger strategy is to establish
a _centralized sales agency_, as in the famous De Beers diamond cartel, or a trade association.
Either institutional arrangement can monitor and report upon both market conditions and
individual firm performance. Monitoring may be further facilitated by agreements to divide
the market explicitly, say by percentage of total sales or by geographic territory.

To summarize, cooperative price-fixing agreements are facilitated when an industry
exhibits characteristics that make the detection and the deterrence of cheating easier.
Such factors include the presence of only a few firms selling homogeneous products on
a reasonably frequent basis and under relatively stable market conditions. All of these
factors have been found to be present in the prosecution of numerous recent international
cartels. [17] Agreements on market division, whether by geography or sales, also make it
easier to monitor the behavior of cartel members. The potential for punishment, in some
cases, violence, is greatly enhanced by such features and should never be understated. [18]

The number of price-fixing conspiracies prosecuted each year suggest that the conditions
described above are often met. In turn, this is clear support for the Folk Theorem. Cartels
happen. Moreover, we only know about the cartels that are detected. There may be many
more collusive agreements that we do not (yet) know. The next question then becomes how
policy and policy makers should deal with the potential for collusion. [19]


14.4 COLLUSION: THE ROLE OF THE ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES


While cartels may eventually fail as a result of their inherent internal conflicts, the evidence
of active cartels makes it clear that the authorities cannot rely on this force alone if they
wish to limit collusive agreements. Indeed, Levenstein and Suslow (2006) note in a recent
survey of various cartels that “in many case studies _. . ._ cheating was simply not a problem
for the cartel” (78). Hence, the authorities will have to take explicit action themselves if
they wish to limit cartel formation. [20]


16 This is perfectly legal because the price-matching guarantees are offered to buyers rather than communicated to other sellers.
17 See Connor (2001) for a detailed and very readable analysis of these cartels.
18 A number of cartels in New York City have used violence to enforce their market power.
19 _The Informant_ (2000) by Kurt Eichenwald provides an informative and amusing illustration of the lysine
cartel that operated in the 1990s and the difficulties this case raised for the antitrust authorities.
20 Kaplow (2011) provides an excellent discussion of policy with respect to cartels.


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 371


14.4.1 Antitrust Enforcement: Detection and Fines


Common to all law enforcement effort, antitrust officials enforcing the prohibition of
price-fixing agreements have essentially two distinct but related tools. The first of these is
detection (which we will take to include successful prosecution). Stricter enforcement can
take the form of closer monitoring thus increasing the probability _q_ that the cartel will be
uncovered and successfully prosecuted in any period: but only, of course, at an increased
cost associated with stricter enforcement. (Such costs are why the authorities are unlikely to
set q = 1.) The second tool is the penalty _F_ applied when a cartel is uncovered and brought
to justice. Rather than expend resources to increase the probability _q_ that this happens, the
authorities can instead raise the penalty _F_ paid by guilty conspirators.

Modeling antitrust enforcement in terms of the detection rate _q_ and the penalty _F_
that is paid upon successful detection may seem quite limiting. The justification for this
simplification though is that it permits the role of detection and fines to be illustrated by
a reasonably simple modification of our earlier analysis. Assume that the authorities set
the probability of detection _q_ . Cartel investigation takes one period. If detected by the
end of period _t_ the cartel is disbanded at the end of the period and the firms return to
the noncooperative game permanently. Detection in period _t_ also leads to the imposition
of a fine _F_, where _F_ is set by the antitrust authorities. It is convenient to think of _F_ as
being backdated to the beginning of period _t_ . We assume that the basic probability that the
game will continue is as before as given by _p_ and that this is independent of the detection
probability.

Now consider what happens at the beginning of some initial period, _t_ = 0. With
probability _(_ 1– _q)_ the cartel is not detected in which case the cartel operates in that period
and continues to period 1 with probability _p_ . Expected profit is:


_V_ 1 _(_ 1 _q)(π_ _[M]_ _ρV_ _[C]_ _)_
=   - +

The first term in the second bracket is profit in the current period (0) given that the cartel
is not detected. The second term uses the same reasoning as we used to derive equation
(14.3). Given that cartel is not detected in period 0 the “cartel game” begins again in period
1 and so has expected profit _V_ _[C]_, which has to be probability discounted one period.

With probability _q_ the cartel is detected by the end of period 0, in which case each cartel
member has to pay the fine _F_, the cartel stops operating but the firms continue to compete
in each subsequent period with probability _p_ . Expected profit in this eventuality is:




   
_V_ 2 _q_
=



_ρ_
_π_ _[M]_ _F_

 - + 1 _ρ_ _[π]_ _[N]_
      






Putting these equations together, the expected present value of profit for a cartel member is
_V_ _[C]_ = _V_ 1 + _V_ 2 :



_ρ_
_π_ _[M]_ _F_

 - + 1 _ρ_ _[π]_ _[N]_
      






_V_ _[C]_ = _(_ 1 − _q)(π_ _[M]_ + _ρV_ _[C]_ _)_ + _q_


Solving for _V_ _[C]_ gives:

_V_ _[C]_ =



_π_ _[M]_ - _qF_ +



(14.14)

372 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


As before, this must be compared with the gains from defecting from the cartel, namely,
_ρ_
_π_ _[D]_
+ _(_ 1 _ρ)_ _[π]_ _[N]_ [. A little more algebra then reveals that the condition required for the]

cartel to succeed now is: −



_π_ _[D]_ _π_ _[M]_
_ρ_ _ρ_ [∗] ≥ = _(_ 1 _q)(π_ _[D]_



_π_ _[D]_ _π_ _[M]_ _qF_

  - (14.15)

_(_ 1 − _q)(π_ _[D]_ - _π_ _[N]_ _)_ [+] _(_ 1 − _q)(π_ _[D]_ - _π_ _[N]_ _)_



It is straightforward to see that equation (14.15) collapses to our earlier condition (14.7),
as both the probability _q_ of uncovering the cartel and the fine _F_ paid by price conspirators
goes to zero. As both _q_ and _F_ rise, however, equation (14.15) shows that the critical
discount factor _ρ_ [∗] also rises. Yet while both _q_ and _F_ are important, they are not symmetric.
It does not matter how large the fine _F_ is if _q_ equals zero because then there is zero chance
of having to pay the fine. The implication of _F_ falling to zero, though, is less severe. This
would mean that the second term in (14.15) vanishes, but from the first term we can see
that increases in _q_ still work to raise _ρ_ [∗] . This is because while detection does not lead to
a fine any longer, it does still impose a cost on the cartel in that once uncovered, we have
assumed that the cartel must revert back to the noncooperative equilibrium.

While the foregoing model is relatively simple, it does carry one very important point.
This is that the role of antitrust policy is not to remedy collusive activity after it has happened
but to prevent it from happening in the first place. By raising the discount factor necessary
for successful cartelization, it becomes less likely that the cartel members can refrain
from cheating. Take our Bertrand example. We know that _π_ _[M]_ = 1,800 _, π_ _[D]_ = 3,600,
and _π_ _[N]_ = 0, so that in the absence of any enforcement policy, i.e., if _q_ = _F_ = 0, the
critical probability factor is _ρ_ [∗] = 0.5. However, if _q_ alone is increased to 0.25, we then
have _ρ_ [∗] = 0.67. If, in addition, we add a penalty _F_ equal to the firm’s collusive profit
of $1800 _, ρ_ [∗] rises further to 0.8333. Moreover, the reality may be that the probability of
detection _q_ itself depends on how aggressively the cartel pursues monopoly profits, as
noted early on by Block, Nold, and Sidak (1981). If so, then to avoid detection the cartel
may need to collude on a price that, while greater than the noncooperative price, is still
well below that of pure monopoly. In this case, the threat of antitrust action has a doubly
preventive effect. First, by limiting the profit from collusion, it again makes collusion less
likely. Second, by inducing cartel members to collude on a lower price, antitrust policy
limits the harm from collusion should it still occur.

Which tool—fines or increased probability of apprehension and conviction—should
the authorities use? Uncovering and prosecuting price-fixing conspiracies requires careful
surveillance and legal work, which is expensive. In contrast fines may be imposed rather
costlessly. This suggests that a heavy reliance on substantial punishment is likely to be
the more cost-effective strategy. In turn, this helps to explain why the law imposes treble
damages in private antitrust lawsuits. The general rule is that some reliance on both detection
and fines is appropriate, though the latter may play the dominant role.


14.4.2 Detecting Collusion


As just noted, uncovering a price-fixing conspiracy is difficult. Knowing the conditions
that make collusion more likely can help the authorities focus their scarce resources in the
right places but even then detection is not easy. In practice, most detection is the result of
complaints by customers and, increasingly, by one member of the cartel “finking” on its
partners so as to escape or limit its own prosecution. In addition, the authorities sometimes
get lucky and the conspiracy will be revealed by firms in the industry who have been unhappy


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 373


either with the shares that they have been allocated in the cartel or because they have been
excluded altogether. [21] However, such luck cannot be counted on as a practical procedure.

The difficulty is that detection in our sense means more than simply uncovering cartel-like
behavior. It means legally proving that a collusive agreement existed. This is harder than
it may at first appear because the cartel members have one very powerfull advantage over
government prosecutors: they are the ones with the true information about the nature of
market demand and production and transportation cost. Indeed, even if one firm admits to
colluding the others can still plead not guilty. The best the authorities can do is to review
market data and internal firm documents and so present as compelling a case as possible.
An obvious obstacle in such effort though is that much of that data will be provided by
the very same firms who are being investigated. In this setting, a collusive outcome can be
made to appear to be competitive. This problem has been termed the _indistinguishability_
_theorem_ by Harstad and Philips (1990). [22]

To show the indistinguishability theorem in action, we consider a case in which
the European Commission ultimately rendered a verdict against ICI and Solvay,
the two firms that control the European market for soda ash, which is a raw
material used in glass manufacture. ICI and Solvay had operated a number of
cartel agreements for many years. Solvay supplied continental Europe while ICI
supplied the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the British Commonwealth. These explicit
agreements terminated in 1972, but there was no subsequent market interpenetration
by the two producers. In the 1980s, prices in the United Kingdom rose some
15 to 20 percent above those in continental Europe, which the Commission argued was
greater than the transport costs across the English Channel. The Commission judged that the
lack of market invasion by either firm into the other’s historic regional market—especially
in the face of such price differentials—was strong evidence of continued tacit collusion by
the two firms.

While the Commission’s judgment may appear to be sound, there is a counter argument.
If each firm has the same marginal cost schedule and if each sets its price equal to marginal
cost plus the cost of transportation across the Channel, no cross-market penetration will ever
occur. Such pricing behavior would reflect true rivalry, would lead to prices well below the
collusive level, and yet there would be no market invasion of one firm by the other. Unless
the regulatory agency has independent data on transportation costs, the nature of demand
on each side of the Channel, and also on production costs, it cannot make a definitive case
that the continued market segmentation is the result of collusive action. Given the available
information, authorities may have great difficulty distinguishing between the collusive and
competitive explanations of the observed data.

The situation facing government authorities is not hopeless. Careful analysis of the data
can provide evidence sufficiently convincing that either a conviction or a settlement in which
the cartel members agree to desist will result. Otherwise, we would see no successful pricefixing prosecutions at all. Studies by Porter and Zona (1993) and (1999) are good illustrations


21 A classic example of this is the garbage-hauling business in New York, which was controlled by a trade
association between firms who carved up the city between them. If a firm in the cartel took business away
from another member, then the association forced the offending company to pay compensation amounting
to “up to forty times the monthly pickup charge.” Any firm attempting to enter the industry was met by
arson and physical violence. Ex-mobsters who had been the victims of the financial penalties and violence
provided some of the evidence necessary to break the cartel. (S. Raab, “To Prosecutors, Breakthrough
After 5 Years of Scrutiny,” _The New York Times_, June 23, 1995, p. 3)

LaCasse (1995).


374 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


of the kind of hard and thoughtful work that is necessary. Both of these studies use differences
between the bidding behavior of cartel members and non-cartel members to identify the
former. The first of these concerned a cartel of construction firms involved in bidding on
highway paving projects on Long Island in the early 1980s. Here Porter and Zona (1999)
found that the while non-cartel members with losing bids had bids that were closely related
to their costs, this was not true of cartel members who submitted losing bids. Similarly,
Porter and Zona (1999) looked at school milk procurement auctions in which a cartel was
active, but in which there were also non-cartel members bidding in the auctions. Here they
found that non-cartel members’ bids increased with distance from the firm to the school
district, as would be expected, while cartel members’ bids often decreased with distance.

Osborne and Pitchik (1987) propose a capacity-based test for detecting collusion. Recall
our discussion in Chapter 12 of the Spence (1977) and Dixit (1980) models in which a large
firm invests in extra capacity as part of its strategy toward rivals. Osborne and Pitchik argue
that extra capacity may play a similar disciplinary role in cartels. In the case of Bertrand
price competition, for example, only a firm with a large capacity can threaten retaliation
against cartel cheaters. Hence, there is a reason for cartel members to acquire large amounts
of capacity even if it will not be used if a collusive agreement is reached and output is held
well below capacity. Yet, as Osborne and Pitchik (1987) note, it is likely that the firms
choose their capacities before the collusive agreement is implemented and that therefore it
is unlikely that each will choose exactly the same amount of capacity. Accordingly, when
collusion subsequently begins, the price versus marginal cost distinction may be the same
for each firm but the profit per unit of capacity will be greater for the firm with the smaller
amount of capacity. Not only will the smaller firm have a higher profit per unit of capacity,
but Osborne and Pitchik (1987) also show that this difference will increase as the total
amount of excess capacity grows. [23] Philips (1995b) subsequently used this result to confirm
the suspicion voiced by a number of British analysts, namely that there was a collusive
agreement between the two main British producers of white salt, British Salt (BS) and ICI
Weston Point (WP). He found that the BS profit per unit of capacity varied from 30 percent
to over 100 percent more than the WP profit per capacity, and that this multiple increased
precisely as the ratio of industry sales per unit of capacity rose.

Some recent papers suggest that a little significant price variation both across firms and
over time may signal collusive activity. [24] Athey, Bagwell, and Sanchirico (2004) show that
while random cost shocks would lead Bertrand competitors to change their prices from one
period to the next, colluding firms will hold prices steady if they are sufficiently patient,
i.e., if the discount factor is close to one.

Harrington and Chen (2006) offer a different model that has a similar result in which
colluders are aware that their customers may recognize that a cartel has formed. In their
model, prices rise relative to cost as the cartel forms and then stabilize with very little
response to cost shocks. Here again, the collusive price tends to be somewhat rigid.

Abrantes-Metz, Froeb, Geweke, and Taylor (2006) look at a cartel comprised of suppliers
of “fin-fish” (cod, haddock, perch, and flounder) to US Army bases from 1984–89. That
cartel collapsed at the end of this period at which point, the average price fell by 16 percent.


23 Davidson and Deneckere (1990) offer a similar analysis.
24 The recent papers are similar in spirit to Sweezy’s (1939) paper suggesting that each colluding firm faces
a “kinked” demand curve at the cartel price. A firm that raises its price even a bit will find itself the
high-priced firm and lose much of its market—the firm’s demand curve is relatively flat. Yet if the firm
reduces it price, it will launch a price war in which all firms cut price with little increase in the amount
sold by any one firm—the firm’s demand curve is relatively steep. As a result, firms tend to keep prices
unchanged even in the face of shocks.


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 375


More critically, these authors note that with the cartel over, the variation in prices across
firms and types of fish increased by nearly three-fold as measured by the coefficient of
variation (the standard deviation divided by the mean). This tends to confirm the theoretical
arguments that a lack of price variation can serve as a marker for collusive activity.

In a similar vein, Marshall, Marx, and Raiff (2008) study the famous lysine cartel of the
1990s. They find that the creation of the cartel was accompanied by a change in the nature of
price announcements. Prior to the cartel, price announcements were made by different firms
at different times and were close to simultaneous with the date of the price change in itself.
Once the cartel was established, however, price announcements were made at much more
regularly timed intervals and quickly supported by all firms. These announcements were
now made with substantial lead time before the price actually changed and they seemed to
bear little relation to cost.

These studies are all useful in alerting authorities to possible clues regarding the existence
of a collusive agreement. Empirically however, they all have the advantage of reviewing a
cartel that has already been discovered. It is the question of how best to do this that lies at
the heart of the issue.


14.4.3 Leniency (Amnesty) Programs and Cartel Detection


Interestingly enough, many if not most of the antitrust success against cartels in recent
years has come about as the result of a member of the cartel confessing to the authorities.
The reason for this is clear. An increasing number of regulatory authorities have enacted
leniency or amnesty programs as a way of combating cartels. While the actual programs
enacted in different regions differ in their details, they typically have the form: “The first
member of a cartel to provide evidence that leads to successful prosecution of the cartel
receives lenient treatment. Everybody else is subject to heavy fines.” Since 1993, the
US authorities have granted complete immunity to the first firm to come forward if the
authorities have not yet started to investigate. However, even if an investigation has been
started, a lighter sentence or even total amnesty might still be offered. This granting of
total amnesty to the first confessing firm in the absence of an active investigation has also
recently been introduced in Europe and has proven central to successful prosecution of the
cartels. [25] Such new programs have been wildly successful in the eyes of the authorities. As
the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice has said:


Today, the Amnesty Program is the Division’s most effective generator of large cases, and it is
the Department’s most successful leniency program. Amnesty applications over the past year
have been coming in at the rate of approximately two per month—a more than _twenty-fold_
_increase_ as compared to the rate of applications under the old Amnesty Program. Given
this remarkable rate of amnesty applications, it certainly appears that the message has been
communicated. (http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/2247.htm)


Why has granting amnesty proven so successful in breaking cartels? One reason is that
such a program encourages finking by cartel members if they believe that an investigation
has been started. Leniency programs effectively put the prisoners’ dilemma to work on
behalf of the authorities. However, as Motta and Polo (2003) and Spagnolo (2004), among
others, have pointed out, that explanation cannot be the whole story. For while leniency


25 For further details of the precise conditions under which amnesty might be granted, see the speech by the
Deputy Assistant Attorney General at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/2247.htm.


376 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


encourages confessions once an investigation is under way, it also raises the possibility of
getting out of the cartel free of prosecution and thereby increases the expected net gains
from starting a cartel in the first place.

The fundamental difficulty is really one that bedevils all attempts to measure the impact
of deterrence efforts. One only sees the outcome when deterrence fails, i.e., when a cartel is
formed—and caught. One does not know how many cartels are formed but escape detection
and, even more important, how many cartels might have been formed but were not because
of the threat of being caught and fined.

Miller (2009) addresses precisely these issues in a very original and important paper.
He develops a stochastic model of endogenous cartel information and then examines
what happens when an amnesty program is introduced. The model makes two very clear
predictions. The first is that the introduction of the amnesty program should, if it leads
to increased detection, cause an immediately noticeable rise in the number of cartels
detected and prosecuted. The second prediction is that if the first prediction is validated—if
the number of cartels detected rises significantly with the introduction of the amnesty

Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 377


program—and then falls to a rate below that observed before the amnesty program began,
then one can infer with certainty that the program is deterring cartel formation. Working
with US data, Miller’s (2009) simulations suggest that the US amnesty program may have
cut the rate of cartel formation by roughly 40 percent. That would certainly justify the
claims of success for this program made by antitrust officials.


14.5 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS
OF PRICE-FIXING


As noted earlier in this chapter, detecting and prosecuting price-fixing agreements requires
real resources. Indeed, much of the analysis above makes clear just how difficult and
therefore expensive it is to achieve a serious rate of detection. Even if cartels would
otherwise be relatively common—and we think the evidence is that they would be—it
may still not be cost effective to allocate any significant amount of scarce resources to
combating them if they only raise prices a small amount. Moreover, the fines to be imposed
on successful cartel members should in principle be related to the damage that they cause.
For both reasons, we need to have estimates of the price effects of collusive agreements. In
turn, this requires that the authorities, or more properly their expert econometric witnesses,
estimate three sets of outcomes: the duration of the cartel, the price(s) charged and quantity
(or quantities) sold by the cartel during the period the cartel is active, and the price(s) that
the cartel would have charged if there had been no cartel—the “but for” price(s).

Of these, undoubtedly the most challenging is determining the “but for” price because
this requires estimating something inherently unobservable in any direct manner. Several
approaches have been suggested for estimating the “but-for” price. First, we could estimate
key demand and cost parameters and use these to simulate a model of noncooperative
behavior, thereby obtaining the “but for” price from the simulated market equilibrium.
Second, we could use a before-and-after approach. That is, identify a period during which
the cartel was not active and generate a measure of the prices charged in that period relative
to the price observed during the operation of the cartel. Third, we could specify and estimate
a reduced-form, time-series econometric model to estimate demand and supply interactions
in the market and include a dummy or other variable to capture the impact of the cartel. Of
these, the second and third are the most commonly used. [26]

The econometric method is typically applied [27] by estimating a reduced-form price
equation of the form:


_Pit_ _α_ _β_ **y** _it_ _γ_ **w** _it_ _δ_ **s** _it_ _λ_ **D** _it_ _εit_ (14.16)
= + + + + +

Here, _Pit_ is price in region _i_ at time _t,_ **y** _it_ is a vector of variables that affect demand (income,
prices of other goods), **w** _it_ is a vector of variables that affect supply (factor prices), **s** _it_
is a vector of market structure variables (concentration, some measure of the strength of
economies of scale), **D** _it_ is a vector of dummy variables intended to capture the impact of
the cartel, and _εit_ is an error term. This is referred to as a reduced form equation because it
is derived from an equilibrium condition equating demand and supply functions, which are
functions themselves of underlying structural parameters that are not directly estimated.


26 Connor (2001) provides a detailed discussion of the use of the before-and-after method in estimating
impact of the lysine cartel.
27 Baker and Rubinfeld (1999) discuss the use of this method.


378 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


A potential drawback of this approach is, of course, that it is very demanding on data.
There needs to be sufficient “before and after” the cartel observations to give reliable
estimates of the dummy variable coefficients and some of the variables in **w** _it_ such as
factor costs can only be obtained with the consent of the firms that are accused of being
parties to the cartel. There will often also be problems with endogeneity of the right-hand
side variables requiring an instrumental-variables estimation technique, with the “correct”
choice of instruments.

There are, however, examples where a variant of the econometric technique has been
used with great effect. One such example is Kwoka (1997), who estimated the price impact
of a long-running cartel to rig prices in a particular set of real estate auctions held in the
District of Columbia.

The auctions related to properties that were either foreclosed as a result of mortgage
default or were being sold under court supervision: the latter are referred to as nisi auctions.
The cartel members constituted a relatively small and stable set of real estate investors who
specialized in the purchase and subsequent resale of this type of property. They operated the
cartel by designating a bidder who would submit an agreed winning bid at the auction while
the other cartel members either did not bid or deliberately bid low. A non-cartel member
who turned up at such an auction was discouraged in various ways. For example, the cartel
members might make negative remarks about the property, or the non-member might be
paid not to bid or might be allowed to purchase just one property. One measure of the
success of this cartel at deterring entry and sustaining the cartel is that the cartel appears to
have operated successfully for roughly fourteen years, from January 1976 to August 1990.

At the end of each public auction the cartel members then conducted a second, private,
“knockout” auction among themselves to determine the final ownership of the property.
Because this auction was conducted as a normal ascending bid auction, the property went to
the high bidder: presumably the cartel member who valued the property most highly. The
winner of the public auction would then be reimbursed for the price that had been paid, and
the remaining difference between the public auction price and the knockout auction price
would be distributed as side payments to the members of the bidding ring.

To see how this collusive arrangement works among _N_ members in the bidding ring, we
denote the true value of the property by _V_, the public auction-winning bid by _P_, and the
knockout auction bid by _K_ . Only _P_ and _K_ are observable. There are _N_ –1 losing bidders
who each receive a pay-off of _S_ where


_S_ _[K]_ [ −] _[P]_ (14.17)
= _N_ 1

    
Every member of the ring knows that a member will be paid at least _S_ if the member
loses in the knockout auction. The winner of the knock out gets _V_ - _K_ and so in equilibrium
_S_ = _V_ - _K_ . In other words, the true value of the property is _V_ = _K_ + _S_ . Using equation
(14.17) this condition implies gives:


_N_ _P_ _N_

_V_ _K_ _[K]_ [ −] _[P]_ (14.18)
= + _N_ 1 _(N_ 1 _)_ _[K]_ [ −] _(N_ 1 _)_ _(N_ 1 _)_ _[(K]_ [ −] _[P)]_

      - [=]      -      - [=] _[ P]_ [ +]      

Kwoka adds a bit more structure to the model by assuming that the fixed public auction
price _P_ on which the bidding ring agreed was a “constant fraction of a property’s competitive
valuation.” If this fraction is _m_ then _m_ = _V/P_ . Substituting _V_ = _mP_ in (14.18) and solving


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 379


for _K_ we have the reduced form equation to be estimated:

_K_ _P_ _(m_ 1 _)P_ _[(N]_ [ −] [1] _[)]_ (14.19)
= +  - _N_


where the independent variables in the regression are _P_ and _P(N_ –1 _)/N_ and _m_ is to be
estimated.

Members of the cartel kept detailed records of the identities of all the bidders in each
auction and the payoffs made to each losing bidder. These records were central to the
eventual prosecution of the cartel. They are also essential to the estimation of the cartel’s
impact on prices. However, of the twelve individuals that were charged with Sherman Act
violations, ten pleaded guilty before trial. Because of this, data are unavailable for these
cases. This left Kwoka with data for thirty of the 680 properties affected by the cartel, all
of which were auctioned between 1980 and 1988.

Summary statistics for these auctions are reported in Table 14.6. The average number
of bidders was 4.6 and ranged from 2 to 9. The average knockout price was 28 percent in
excess of the public auction price, or, alternatively, the rigged public auction price was on
average 22 percent less than the knockout price.

This is not, however, the full impact of the cartel, because we know that _V_ = _K_ + _S_ .
Moreover it can be seen from Table 14.6 that there is considerable variance in _K/P_ .
Kwoka, therefore, estimated equation (14.19) directly, obtaining the results in column (a)
of Table 14.7.

In the first regression in column (a), observe that the coefficients on the two terms _P_
and _P(N_ –1 _)/N_ are significant and have the expected signs and the fit is remarkable. In
addition, the coefficient on _P_ is (just) insignificantly different from unity, as required by
equation (14.19). The coefficient on _P(N_ –1 _)/N_ is an estimate of _m_ –1, giving _m_ = 1.86.
Because _P/V_ = 1 _/m_, this tells us that _P/V_ = 0.54. In other words, the cartel results in
public bid prices 46 percent lower than the true valuation of the properties being auctioned.

Kwoka then estimated two refinements on the simple model of equation (14.19). First,
of the thirty properties in his sample, nineteen were foreclosure auctions and eleven were
nisi auctions. Because the latter are held under court supervision it is possible that the cartel
members would be more careful in their public auction bidding. Suppose, therefore, that
on nisi actions we have that _V/P_ = _m_ - _d_ . Introduce a dummy variable _D_ that takes the
value of unity for nisi auctions and zero otherwise. Then the reduced form to be estimated
becomes:




[ −] [1] _[)]_

_dDP_ _[(N]_ [ −] [1] _[)]_
_N_ - _N_



_K_ _P_ _(m_ 1 _)P_ _[(N]_ [ −] [1] _[)]_
= + - _N_



(14.20)
_N_



The results are given in column (b) of Table 14.7. The coefficient on _DP(N_ –1 _)/N_ is the
estimate of _d_ . It has the correct sign (negative) but is statistically insignificant.

(3.08)
_R_ [2] 0.979 0.980 0.995
_S_ 667 433 694


The second refinement modifies the mechanism by which losing bidders in the cartel
were compensated. In some auctions, losing bidders were compensated equally while in
others the compensation was based on each losing bidder’s final but losing bid. The impact
of unequal compensation is potentially ambiguous. On the one hand, it might make bidders
more aggressive to secure themselves a higher share. On the other hand, aggressive bidding
might result in a bidder winning an auction the bidder did not want to win. To test for
this impact, Kwoka added a dummy variable UNEQUAL to equation (14.20) and ran the
regression for the eighteen auctions in which it was possible to distinguish the compensation
mechanism.

The results are given in column (c) of Table 14.7. The coefficient on UNEQUAL is
positive and significant, implying that unequal compensation increased the subsequent
knockout price. Moreover, the coefficient on _P(N_ –1 _)/N_ gives a revised estimate for _m_ of
1.48, implying that the cartel rigged the public auction prices to 32.5 percent below the true
property values. From this and the rest of Kwoka’s (1997) results, this cartel is seen to have
had an unambiguous and significant impact on the prices at which these properties were
traded in the public auctions.

Kwoka’s (1997) findings are broadly consistent with those of many other researchers.
For example, Froeb, Koyak, and Werden (1993) found that a price-rigging scheme involved
in supplying frozen fish to the US military raised prices by 23 to 30 percent. Connor (2001)
found that the lysine cartel raised the market price by 17 percent, while Morse and Hyde
(2000) argue the effect was twice as high at 34 percent. In two exhaustive reviews of the
evidence, Lande and Connor (2005) and Connor and Bolotova (2006) find that the median
cartel price effect over all time periods and across all cartel types is on the order of 22 to
28 percent, with the effect higher for international rather than purely domestic cartels. [28] All
of these suggest that the losses associated with price fixing are substantial and well worth
trying to combat—especially given the additional finding by Connor and Bolotova (2006)
that the typical cartel lasts eight to nine years.


28 Sproul (1993) is the one contrary study, finding that industry prices rise slightly _after_ an indictment,
which he interprets as evidence that cartels keep costs low. Apart from notable data problems, Sproul’s
(1993) analysis suffers from the difficulty that indictments only come after a long investigation. If the
investigation itself triggers a breakdown in the cartel, then prices will fall long before the indictment.
What happens at the indictment date then gives little guidance as to the actual cartel price effect.


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 381



**Summary**


At least since the time of Adam Smith, there
has been the fear that firms in the same industry
may collude and raise prices above the level that
would otherwise prevail. The good news over
the last dozen years or so is that a large number of such collusive cartels have been caught
and successfully prosecuted in the courts both
in Europe and North America. The bad news
is that this same evidence also reveals that collusion remains a real problem. Somehow firms
are able to work out and implement cooperative
strategies rather than noncooperative ones. So,
while the competition authorities can feel good
about the cartels that have been broken, they must
also worry that there are many other price-fixing
agreements that they have not uncovered.

It is the repetition of strategic interaction that
makes cartels possible. Firms rarely meet on the
corporate battlefield just once. Instead, they can
expect to meet many times, and perhaps in many
other markets as well. When a game is played
only once, each firm has a strong incentive to
cheat on the collusive agreement. Because the
agreement is not legally enforceable, there is little any firm can do to deter others from cheating.
However, when the game is played repeatedly
over a number of periods, the scope for cooperation widens considerably. This is because a
firm can threaten to “punish” any cheating on the
collusive agreement in one period by being more
aggressive in the subsequent periods.


**Problems**


1. Suppose that two firms compete in quantities (Cournot) in a market in which demand
is described by: _P_ = 260–2 _Q_ . Each firm
incurs no fixed cost but has a marginal cost
of 20.
a. What is the one-period Nash equilibrium market price? What is the output
and profit of each firm in this equilibrium?
b. What is the output of each firm if they
collude to produce the monopoly output? What profit does each firm earn
with such collusion?


2. Return to the cartel in Problem 1. Suppose
that after the cartel is established, one firm
decides to cheat on the collusion, assuming



While repetition of the game is necessary for
firms to collude successfully, it is not by itself
sufficient. In addition to the game being repeated,
it must have an indefinite end point. That is, in
any given period, there is always a positive probability that the game will be played one more
time. Absent these conditions, Selten’s Theorem
makes clear that a finitely repeated game with
a unique noncooperative Nash equilibrium will
simply result in that Nash equilibrium being the
outcome in each period. However, for repeated
games that go on indefinitely, the Folk Theorem
makes clear that collusion that allows for all firms
to gain relative to the one-shot Nash equilibrium
is possible.

We have further shown that an active antitrust
policy reduces the likelihood of a cartel being
self-sustaining. However, this by no means guarantees that cartels will not be formed. Based on
the historical evidence, it appears that the conditions for successful collusion are often met and
that when they are formed, cartels significantly
raise prices—typically on the order of 20 to 30
percent above the price that competitive behavior
would yield. Antitrust concern with price fixing
agreements thus appears justified. In this connection, the recent tactic of granting amnesty to the
first cartel member who discloses the collusive
agreement to the authorities appears to have been
very helpful in detecting and deterring collusive
behavior.


that the other firm will continue to produce
its half of the monopoly output.

a. Given the deviating firm’s assumption,
how much will it produce?
b. If the deviating firm’s assumption is
correct, what will be the industry price
and the deviating firm’s profit in this
case?


3. Suppose that the market game described in
Problems 1 and 2 is now repeated indefinitely. Show that the collusive agreement
can be maintained so long as the probability
adjusted discount factor, _ρ >_ 0.53.


4. Suppose again that market demand is given
by _P_ = 260–2 _Q_ and that firms again have


382 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy



a constant marginal cost of 20, while incurring no fixed cost. Now, however, assume
that firms compete in prices (Bertrand) and
have unlimited capacity.
a. What is the one-period Nash equilibrium price? Assuming that firms share
the market evenly any time they charge
the same price, what is the output and
profit of each firm in this market equilibrium?
b. What will be the equilibrium output
and profit of each firm if each agrees to
charge the monopoly price?


5. Return to Problem 4. Assume that the cartel is established at the monopoly price.
Suppose one firm now deviates from the
agreement assuming that its rival continues
to charge the monopoly price.
a. Given the deviating firm’s assumption,
what price will maximize its profit?
b. If its assumption is correct, how much
will the profit of the cheating firm be?
How much will be the profit of its
non-cheating rival?


6. Return again to the cartel in Problems 4
and 5. Now suppose that the market game
is repeated indefinitely. What probability
adjusted discount factor is necessary now in
order to maintain the collusive agreement?


7. Compare your answers in Problems 3 and
6. Based on this comparison, which market
setting do you think is more amenable to
cartel formation, one of Cournot competition or one of Bertrand competition?


8. Once again, assume Cournot competition
in an industry in which market demand is
described by _P_ = 260–2 _Q_ and in which
each firm has a marginal cost of 20. However, instead of two firms, let there now be
four.
a. What is the one-period Nash equilibrium market price? What is the
output and profit of each firm in this
equilibrium?
b. What is the output of each firm if they
collude to produce the monopoly output? What profit does each firm earn
with such collusion?


9. Return to Problem 8. Suppose that one firm
decides to cheat on the collusion, assuming



that each of the three other firms continue
to one-fourth of the monopoly output.
a. Given the deviating firm’s assumption,
how much will it produce?
b. Assuming that its assumption is correct, what will be the industry price
and the deviating firm’s profit?


10. Consider again your results in Problems 8
and 9. Suppose that the market game is
repeated indefinitely. Show that the collusive agreement can be maintained so long
as the probability adjusted discount factor,
_ρ >_ 0.610.


11. Compare your answers in Problems 10 and
3. Based on this comparison, what do you
infer about the ability of firms to sustain a
collusive agreement as the number of firms
in the industry expands?


12. Imagine that in the 1990s, the market
demand for the food additive, lysine, had
a price elasticity of 1.55. The structure of
that market and the (assumed to constant)
marginal cost per pound for each firm are
shown below:


_Firm_ _Market_ _Marginal_
_Share_ _Cost_


Ajinomoto 32% $0.70
Archer Daniels Midland 32% $0.70
Kiyowa Hakko 14% $0.80
Sewon/Miwon 14% $0.80
Cheil Sugar 4% $0.85
Cargill 4% $0.85


a. Use elasticity, market share, and cost
data above to determine the weighted
average industry equilibrium price if
the firms are competing in quantities.
b. During the 1990s, the lysine producers formed a (now famous) cartel that
maintained the shares shown in part
a. Under the cartel, the world price of
lysine rose to an average of $1.12 per
pound. Total world production at this
time was about 100 thousand metric
tons per year. A metric ton = 2,200
pounds. What was the total additional
profit that the industry earned as a result
of the cartel?


13. Suppose that a cartel has just been created
and it includes both large and small firms,


Price Fixing, Repeated Games, and Antitrust Policy 383



each having different average and marginal
costs curves. The cartel agreement is for
each member to reduce its output by 20
percent from the current level. Suppose that
the current level of industry output approximates the competitive output level. Will
this 20 percent reduction rule maximize the
cartel’s profit? Explain why or why not.


14. It has often been noted that cartel firms tend
to maintain excessive capacity. This is true,
for example, in the case of OPEC (especially for Saudi Arabia). It was also true in

## **Part Five**
# **Contractual Relations Between Firms**

In this part, we examine the various ways in which firms may interact that involve formal and
legally enforceable contracts. Such formal relationships employ strategic considerations
just as much as do the pricing and production decisions considered in the last several
chapters. However, the manifestation of these tactical issues is more nuanced because, by
its very nature, a formal contract involves some elements of cooperation as well as the usual
ingredient of self-interest.

Chapters 15 and 16 explore the implications of the most binding of all contracts, the
marriage agreement, which in the corporate world translates into the merger (or acquisition)
agreement. Chapter 15 explores the issues surrounding the merger of two firms that formerly
competed against each other in the same product market, a horizontal merger. We show
that these happen with greater frequency than simple oligopoly models predict, and some
time is taken to determine why. Of course, a merger between two former rivals may be
motivated by a desire to reduce competition. Therefore, the antitrust authorities and the
courts must often evaluate such mergers and try to forecast the post-merger market outcome.
The empirical application in this chapter aims at illuminating recent merger simulation
techniques used to evaluate the impact of proposed mergers.

Chapter 16 continues with the merger theme, this time in a vertical or conglomerate
setting. Mergers between upstream and downstream firms raise interesting questions of
organizational strategy and antitrust policy, such as the double-marginalization question,
foreclosure of rivals, and strategic commitment. We end with a discussion of the Hortac¸su
and Syverson (2007) study of vertical integration in the ready-mixed concrete industry.

In Chapter 17, we consider vertical price restraints wherein one firm, say an upstream
manufacture, imposes either an upper or lower limit on the price that the retailer selling its
product can charge. We show that such agreements can be potentially welfare-enhancing
for both producers and consumers, but that there is also a chance that they can foster
collusion and harm welfare. As an empirical analysis we offer the recent study by Smith
and MacKay (2007) on the impact of the _Leegin_ decision removing the _per se_ illegality of
vertical price restraints.

Last, in Chapter 18, we consider non-price vertical restrictions such as exclusive
territories, exclusive agency contracts, and the after-market issues raised by the 1992 Kodak
case. We also discussion divisionalization. We then use the Sass (2005) study of the US
beer industry to provide some evidence on common non-price vertical restrictions.


### **15** **Horizontal Mergers**

The merger mania that transformed much of corporate America through the 1990s largely
disappeared in the wake of the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, the corporate scandals
at Enron, Tyco, HealthSouth, and WorldCom, and the bursting of the dot.com bubble. There
was a resurgence in merger activity from 2004—2008 but that also disappeared with the
financial crisis that continues to affect economic activity in the United States. Despite the
recent downturn in merger activity, however, there were over 9,500 new merger deals with
a total value of $840 billion struck in the year ended 05/31/2011 and over 9,000 merger
deals with a total value of $759 billion struck in the year ended 05/31/2012. The urge to
merge may not be as strong as it was in the 1990s, but it is by no means absent.

The organization and reorganization of firms brought about by mergers and acquisitions
raises several issues. Perhaps the most important of these is: why merge? What is
the motivation behind the marriage of two (or more) firms? One possible answer is
that a merger creates cost savings by eliminating wasteful duplication or by improving
information flows within the merged organization. Similarly, a merger may lead to more
efficient pricing and/or improved services to customers. This is the case when two firms
producing complementary goods such as nuts and bolts merge. [1]

If the primary motivation for mergers is to reduce costs or rationalize complementary
production, mergers are likely to be beneficial to society as well as to the merging firms
and ought not to be discouraged. However, mergers can also be viewed as an attempt to
create legal cartels. The merged firms come under common ownership and control. Hence,
the new corporate entity coordinates what were formerly separate actions with a view to
achieving the joint profit-maximizing outcome. By placing such coordination within the
boundaries of one firm, a merger legitimizes precisely the kind of behavior that would have
been illegal had the two firms remained separate. In this light, mergers can be seen as an
undesirable attempt to create and exploit monopoly power in a market.

Mergers pose a difficult challenge for antitrust policy because policy makers need to
be able to distinguish between anticompetitive mergers, on the one hand, and those that
are not injurious to competition, on the other. This tension is openly acknowledged in the
Overview to the Merger Guidelines. “While challenging competitively harmful mergers,


1 See Section 8.3 in Chapter 8.


Horizontal Mergers 387


the Agency seeks to avoid unnecessary interference within the larger universe of mergers
that are either competitively beneficial or neutral.” [2]

We explore these issues in this chapter and the next. We examine what economic theory
can tell us about the profit rationale for mergers and whether the enhanced profit stems from
greater efficiency or from enhanced monopoly power. While the relevant theory is mainly
an extension of the Cournot and Bertrand models, we warn the reader in advance that it is
nevertheless somewhat challenging. The rewards of a deeper understanding of mergers and
merger policy justify, we hope, the necessary extra effort you will have to put in.

Before proceeding further, it is useful to classify merger types because not all mergers
are alike. An important source of distinction is the nature of the relationship that exists
between the merging firms prior to their combination. This gives rise to three different kinds
of mergers. First, there are horizontal mergers. These occur when the firms joining together
in the merger were formerly competitors in the same product market. A horizontal merger
involves two or more firms that, so far as their buyers are concerned, market substitute
products. The proposed 2011 merger of the mobile telecommunications carriers AT&T and
T-Mobile is one example of a horizontal merger. The 2008 merger of Delta and Northwest
Airlines is another.

Vertical mergers are the second type. Such mergers typically join firms at different stages
in the vertical production chain. Consider the proposed purchase by Google of Motorola.
These two firms are not direct competitors. Google is primarily a software and services
producer, whereas Motorola is a hardware company making products designed to run,
among others, Google software. The 2006 purchase of Murphy Farms, a major hog farming
enterprise by Smithfield Foods, the largest pork company in the world, is a similar vertical
combination. Vertical mergers include more than mergers between upstream-downstream
firms. They also include any combination of firms that, prior to the merger, produced
complementary goods. The merger between Hewlett-Packard, primarily a producer of
software, printers, and scanners, and Compaq, a major personal computer firm, would fall
in the vertical category. The merger of CSX and Conrail, two large freight rail companies
in the eastern United States, provides another example. An important rationale for this
merger was that the two firms provide complementary services to customers who wish to
transport goods on one continuous system from the southeast of the United States to the
northeast.

Finally, conglomerate mergers involve the combination of firms without either a clear
substitute or a clear complementary relationship. General Electric, a firm that produces
aircraft engines, electric products, financial services, and through its subsidiary NBC
television programming, is one of the world’s most successful conglomerate firms. Recent
examples of conglomerate mergers include, (1) the purchase of Duracell Batteries by
Gillette, (2) the purchase of Snapple (iced tea) and Gatorade (a sports drink) by Quaker
Oats, and (3) the merger of CUC International, a health and home-shopping company with
HFS, a major hotel firm.

In this chapter, we focus on horizontal mergers. Because these reflect combinations of
two or more firms in the same industry, they raise the most obvious antitrust concerns.
Vertical and conglomerate mergers are discussed in Chapter 16.

the potential adverse effects of mergers is particularly relevant.


388 Contractual Relations Between Firms


15.1 HORIZONTAL MERGERS AND THE MERGER PARADOX


As we noted above, horizontal mergers replace two or more former competitors with a
single firm. The merger of two firms in a three-firm market changes the industry to a
duopoly. The merger of duopolists creates a monopoly. The potential for a merger to create
monopoly power is clearly an issue in the horizontal case. Our first order of business is
therefore rather surprising. It is to discuss a phenomenon known as the _merger paradox_ .
The paradox is that it is, in fact, quite difficult to construct a simple economic model in
which there are sizable gains for firms participating in a horizontal merger _that is not a_
_merger to monopoly_ . [3] We illustrate the paradox using the Cournot model of Section 9.4. [4]

Let’s start with a simple example. Suppose we have three firms, each with a constant
marginal cost of _c_ = $30 and jointly facing an industry demand curve given by: _P_ =
150 − _Q_ . The Cournot equilibrium results in each firm producing one-fourth of the
competitive output, or 30, so that total output is 90. The price therefore is _P_ = $60 and
each firm earns a profit of 30 _(_ $60 − $30 _)_ = $900 _._

What happens if two of these firms merge? In the wake of a two-firm merger, the industry
contains two firms, each of which produces one-third of the competitive output, or 40, so
that total output now falls to 80. The price rises to $70 and each of the two remaining firms
earn a profit of $1,600 _._

What is the market impact of the merger? First, note that the merger is bad for consumers.
Output falls and price rises. Second, the merger is good news for the firm that _did not_
merge. The merger allows it to expand its output to 40 units and to sell these at a higher
price than previously so that it enjoys a profit increase of $1,600 − $900 = $700. Finally,
we come to the central element in the merger paradox. For the two firms that merge, the
merger does not pay off. Previously, each firm produced 30 units and earned a profit of
$900 for a combined pre-merger output and profit of 60 units and $1,800 _,_ respectively. In
the post-merger market, however, these two firms have a combined output of only 40 and
a total profit of $1,600. The merger has hurt the firms that merged and brought benefits to
their rival. If this example is reflective of a more general result, then we ought not to observe
many horizontal mergers. Of course, the paradox is that we do observe such mergers all
the time.

Even more paradoxically, the foregoing example is far from being a special case. It is
in fact easy to show that a merger will almost certainly be unprofitable in the basic Cournot
model so long as the merger does not create a monopoly. To see this more general result,
start by assuming a market of _N >_ 2 firms, each of which produces a homogeneous product
and acts as a Cournot competitor. The firms have identical costs given by the total cost
function


_C(qi)_ _cqi_ for i 1 _, .., N,_ (15.1)
= =


where _qi_ is an output of firm _i_ . Market demand is linear and, in inverse form, is given by
the equation


_P_ = _A_  - _BQ_ = _A_  - _B(qi_ + _Q_  - _i),_ (15.2)


3 A merger to monopoly is when all the firms in an industry combine into a single monopoly producer.
4 The paradox was first formalized in a slightly different form by Salant, Switzer, and Reynolds (1983).
