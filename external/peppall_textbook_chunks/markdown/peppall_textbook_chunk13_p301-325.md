Entry Deterrence and Predation 289


require that the actions taken by a firm are profitable _only if_ they drive existing rivals out of
the market or deter potential rivals from coming in to the market.

To put it somewhat loosely, predatory conduct must appear on the surface to reduce the
predator firm’s profit and seem to be “irrational.” The rationality for such conduct would
be the additional profit the predator earns _if and only if_ the conduct is successful at limiting
the competition.

When the “irrational” or predatory action in question is the firm’s setting an ultra-low
price that drives rival firms out of business it is called _predatory pricing_ . Historically,
accusations of such predatory pricing are among the most common cases of alleged
predation. However, setting a low price that instead deters potential rivals from entering
the market in the first place can also be predatory. The entry-limiting price is typically
referred to as the _limit price_ . If output is the strategic variable, we will refer to the analogous
entry-deterring output as the _limit output_ . We start the important work of this chapter by
reviewing two approaches to limit pricing. The first one is an earlier approach predating the
advent of a game theoretic treatment of the subject. The second approach takes the insight
of the first but derives a more fundamental explanation of such entry deterrence rooted in a
dynamic game between the incumbent and the entrant.


12.2.1 An Informal Model of Entry Deterrence


The traditional limit-pricing story of entry deterrence is told in the work of Bain (1956) and
later modeled in Sylos-Labini (1962). These earlier industrial organization economists were
shrewd observers of everyday business practices and had reasons to believe that predatory
pricing and entry-deterring behavior occurred. We can illustrate the essence of the limit
pricing strategy using a simple variant of the Stackelberg model. Recall from the previous
chapter that the strategic variable in the Stackelberg model is quantity. So, the analysis
we present might more properly be labeled a limit output model, rather than a limit price
one. Yet the basic idea of setting the strategic variable so as to deter entry is the same in
either case—especially because the dominant firm’s output choice will greatly influence the
industry price. That is, we might regard the resulting price in our model as the limit price.

Figure 12.1 illustrates the essential features of the model. The incumbent firm is the
Stackelberg leader and is allowed to choose its output first. We begin by making a simple
and yet strong assumption that whatever this choice is, the entrant believes that its own
entry into the market will not alter the leader’s choice of output. That is, the entrant regards
the incumbent as irrevocably committed to its output choice. A further crucial assumption
is that the entrant’s average cost declines over at least the initial range of low levels of
production. When both of these assumptions hold, then by the correct choice of its pre-entry
output level, the incumbent can manipulate the entrant’s profit calculation and discourage
entry.

In Figure 12.1, the appropriate production level to which the incumbent must commit to
deter entry is _Q_ ~~.~~ If the entrant stays out, this implies a market price _P_ ~~.~~ What would happen
to market price if the entrant now produced any positive output? The answer is also shown
in Figure 12.1. Because the entrant believes that the incumbent will maintain _Q_ ~~,~~ the demand
the new entrant faces at any price _P_ is the total quantity that is demanded at that price, _D(P)_,
less _Q_ ~~.~~ That is, the entrant faces a _residual demand curve R_ _[e]_ that, in this case, is simply
the market demand curve _D(P)_ shifted inward along the horizontal axis by the amount _Q_ ~~.~~
Corresponding to this residual demand curve is the entrant’s marginal revenue curve _MR_ _[e]_ .
The entrant maximizes its profit by selecting output _q_ _[e]_ at which its marginal revenue just

equals its marginal cost. As shown in Figure 12.1, this output is such that when it is added
to the output _Q_ of the incumbent firm market price becomes _P_ 0 and this price barely covers
the entrant’s average cost. In other words, by committing to the output _Q_ ~~,~~ the incumbent
firm removes any profit incentive for the entrant to actually participate in the market.


price, _Q_ is the output of the incumbent firm, and _q_ is the output of a potential entrant to
the market. The incumbent firm’s total cost function is _T C(Q)_ = 40 _Q_, whereas the cost
function of the entrant is _C(q)_ = 100 + 40 _q_, where 100 is a sunk cost incurred to enter the
market.


a. If the entrant observes the incumbent producing _Q_ 0 units of output and expects this
output level to be maintained, write down the equation for the residual demand curve
that the entrant firm faces.
b. If the entrant firm maximizes profit given the residual demand curve in (a) what output
_q_ _[e]_ will the entrant produce? (Your answer should be a function of _Q_ 0.)
c. How much output would the incumbent firm have to produce to just keep the entrant out
of the market? That is, solve for the limit output _Q_ ~~.~~ At what price will the incumbent
sell the limit output?


It should be clear that successful predation of the type just described depends crucially
on the entrant’s belief that the incumbent is truly committed to its action. In the language
of the last chapter, the strategy must be subgame perfect. The issue then becomes whether
this is possible. Can the incumbent truly commit to produce output _Q_ even if the entrant
enters the market?

Earlier scholars such as Bain (1956) and Sylos-Labini (1962) did not formally address the
credibility issue. Nevertheless, they do appear to have understood that in order deter entry
the incumbent firm had to commit or “lock in” to the predatory behavior. They assumed
that such commitment was achieved by further supposing that the incumbent’s output _Q_
was “very” costly to adjust. Hence, the potential entrant was correct to assume that the


Entry Deterrence and Predation 291


incumbent’s output would remain at _Q_ because it was too costly to change. In other words,
the presence of adjustment costs once the incumbent is already producing at a particular level
acted as a mechanism to commit the incumbent to the output _Q_ even in the face of entry.

The idea sounds plausible and may well be true. Unfortunately, as stated, it is a little
_ad hoc_ . Without a full specification of how such costs are generated and how they fit into a
complete analysis of strategic interaction between the two firms, the adjustment cost story
amounts to little more than a statement that the incumbent’s output is given because it is
given. Producing _Q_ is truly credible only if _Q_ is the incumbent’s best response to the entrant
coming into the market and choosing an output level to produce. Limit pricing can only
work if the incumbent firm can commit to producing the limit output even if entry occurs.


12.2.2 Capacity Expansion as a Credible Entry-Deterring Commitment


In a key article, Spence (1977) recognized that what may make limit pricing a credible
deterrent strategy is the incumbent firm’s ability to make a prior and irrevocable investment
in production capacity, and specifically an investment in the _capacity_ to produce the
limit output _Q_ ~~.~~ Spence’s work was followed by Dixit (1980) who worked out a precise
mechanism by which the incumbent could guarantee that in the post-entry market, it would
produce an output equal to its pre-entry capacity [See also Gilbert and Harris (1984) and
Gilbert (1989)]. As a result, the potential entrant’s belief that this will occur is reasonable,
i.e., the strategy is subgame perfect. We present the essentials of Dixit’s model below. We
warn the reader in advance that this model is hard work. While no one piece of the analysis
is difficult, considerable care is required in putting all the pieces together.

The game Dixit posits between the two firms is a dynamic, two-stage one in the spirit
of those covered in the previous chapter. In the frst stage, the incumbent firm is alone and
chooses a capacity level that we will denote as _K_ 1 ~~.~~ This commits the firm to a fixed cost of
_rK_ 1 where _r_ is the cost per unit of capacity. One unit of capacity provides one unit of the
input _K_ needed to produce one unit of output. Hence, by investing in capacity _K_ 1 in the
first stage of the game, the incumbent firm has the capability of producing any output less
than or equal to _K_ 1 when the second stage of the game begins. However, the incumbent’s
capacity can be further increased in stage two of the game. Again, this will cost _r_ per unit.
The difference is that this is a marginal decision at that time. One can add just one unit
of the input _K_ or many at a cost of _r_ apiece. In contrast, the initial _K_ 1 units of capacity
cannot be reduced. They represent a fixed cost in stage two, for which the firm will pay _rK_ 1
regardless of what its production level is.

The potential entrant observes the incumbent’s capacity choice in stage one. It is only
after that observation that the potential entrant makes its entry decision in stage two. If entry
does occur then, in the second stage of the game, the two firms play a Cournot game in
output. Market demand for the product in stage two is described by _P_ _A_ _B(q_ 1 _q_ 2 _)_ . It
is very important to note that the two firms simultaneously choose both their outputs = - + _(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_
and their levels of input _K(K_ 1 _, K_ 2 _)_ in stage two. For the incumbent, this input choice is
constrained because its capacity in the second stage cannot be less than the capacity chosen
in the first stage, i.e., _K_ 1 _K_ 1 ~~.~~ The incumbent firm can increase its capacity in stage two
but not decrease it below the precomitted level. ≥

We will denote any sunk costs incurred by the incumbent other than those associated
with its capacity choice _K_ 1 as _F_ 1. For simplicity, we will further assume that every unit
produced requires the input of one unit of labor as well as a unit of input _K_ . If labor can
be hired at the wage _w_, then the incumbent’s marginal cost of production in stage two for


292 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


output if _K_ 1 _K_ 1 is just _w_ . However, if the incumbent wishes to produce an output greater
than _q_ 1 then it must expand capacity by hiring additional units of ≤ _K_, again at the price of _r_
per unit, as well as hire more labor at a cost of _w_ per unit. That is, every unit of output above
_K_ 1 has marginal cost _w_ _r_ . These relationships are reflected in the following description
+
of the incumbent’s cost function in stage two of the game:



_C_ 1 _(q_ 1 _, K_ 1 _, w, r)_ = _F_ 1 + _rK_ 1 + _wq_ 1; for _q_ 1 ≤ _K_ 1 Marginal Cost = _w_

_C_ 1 _(q_ 1 _, K_ 1 _, w, r)_ = _F_ 1 + _rK_ 1 + _r(q_ 1 − _K_ 1 _)_ + _wq_ 1 _,_ for _q_ 1 _> K_ 1 Marginal Cost = _w_ + _r_

(12.4)
The incumbent’s marginal cost is _w_ for output up to _K_ 1 but _w_ _r_ for higher levels. Now
+
denote any sunk cost the entrant incurs as result of participating in the market as _F_ 2. The
entrant’s cost function implies that its marginal cost is always _w_ + _r_ no matter what output
it chooses, as shown below:

_C_ 2 _(q_ 2 _, w, r)_ = _F_ 2 + _(r_ + _w)q_ 2 Marginal Cost = _w_ + _r_ (12.5)

Note that for any output _q_ that fully utilizes its capacity equal to _K_ 1 ~~,~~ the incumbent’s
total cost will be the same as cost incurred by the entrant to produce that same output,
namely, _(w_ + _r)q_ . That is, the incumbent’s initial capacity investment does not give it an
advantage in terms of total cost. Instead, what that investment does achieve is a change
in the composition of the incumbent’s cost. Up to production level _K_ 1 ~~,~~ that cost now
reflects an additional fixed cost of _rK_ 1 ~~,~~ and variable cost of just _wq_ 1. In particular, firm
1’s advantage is that up to any output less than or equal to _K_ 1 ~~,~~ its _marginal_ cost is just
_w_ in stage two whereas the entrant faces a marginal cost of _w_ + _r_ for all output levels.
This difference is reflected in Figure 12.2, where we draw the marginal cost curve for both
firms. The diagram suggests why investment in capacity can have a commitment value.
The incumbent’s commitment to produce at least as much as _K_ 1 is made more believable
by the fact that up to that production level, its marginal cost is _relatively_ low.

In a sequential game, we begin by working out what happens in the last stage in order to
work out the incumbent firm’s optimal move in the first stage. To solve for a subgame perfect
equilibrium strategy for the incumbent firm, we need to determine how the incumbent’s
choice of capacity in stage one affects the market outcome when the two firms compete in
stage two. So, we start by working out what happens in stage two for any particular level

**Figure 12.2** The effect of previously acquired capacity on current marginal cost
The incumbent has previously acquired capacity _K_ 1 and therefore incurs a marginal cost of only _w_ up to this
level of production. For greater levels, its marginal cost is _w_ + _r_ . The entrant has no previously acquired
capacity. Its marginal cost is _w_ + _r_ for all production levels.


Entry Deterrence and Predation 293


of capacity chosen in stage one. We then determine what happens in stage one by choosing
the capacity that maximizes the incumbent’s profits in stage two.

In stage two, the firms are playing a Cournot game in quantities. From our analysis in
Chapter 9, we know that the marginal revenue for each firm is given by:


Incumbent Marginal Revenue : _MR_ 1 _A_ 2 _Bq_ 1 _Bq_ 2
=               -               
Entrant Marginal Revenue : _MR_ 2 _A_ _Bq_ 1 2 _Bq_ 2 (12.6)
=               -               
As always, the profit-maximizing output choice for each firm is to produce where
marginal revenue equals marginal cost. For the entrant, the implication of this rule is clear.
Because the entrant’s marginal cost is always _w_ + _r_, its optimal output choice will always
be given by the best response function:



2 [∗] _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_

[=] 2 _B_



_q_ 2 [∗]




_[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_

2 _B_ - _[q]_ 2 [1]



(12.7)
2



Recall, however, that the incumbent’s marginal cost depends on whether or not the firm is
producing beyond its initial capacity investment _K_ 1. Hence, the incumbent’s best response
function will also depend on where its production lies relative to _K_ 1. In particular, we have:



1 [∗] _[(A]_ [ −] _[w)]_

[=] 2 _B_



1 [∗] 1 [;][ and]

[≤] _[K]_

1 [∗] _[> K]_ 1 (12.8)



This means that the incumbent firm’s best response function jumps at the output level
_q_ 1 [∗][=] _[ K]_ 1 [. We can see the jump more clearly when we draw the incumbent’s best response]

function in the second stage of the game. We do this in Figure 12.3, where the best response
function when marginal cost is just _w_ is shown as _L_ [′] _L_, while the best response curve when
marginal cost is _w_ + _r_ is shown as _N_ [′] _N_ . Again, the incumbent’s actual best response curve
is a composite of these two line segments that switches from the low-cost curve _L_ [′] _L_ to the
high-cost curve _N_ [′] _N_ at _K_ 1, the incumbent’s capacity that is given in stage two but chosen
in stage one of the game.

One point worth stressing before going further is that the entrant’s best response function
(12.7) applies on the condition that the entrant chooses to produce any output at all, i.e.,
so long as _q_ 2 _>_ 0. The best response function is derived using the marginal conditions
and therefore does _not_ take account of the sunk cost _F_ 2 that the potential entrant incurs
should it actually decide to enter. The intercept of equation (12.7) with the _q_ 2 axis, namely,
_(A_ - _w_ - _r)/_ 2 _B_ is the entrant’s optimal output if the incumbent somehow decided to
produce nothing. That would correspond to the entrant being a monopoly and would almost
certainly imply positive profits (otherwise we could rule out entry from the start). However,
as one moves from left to right along the entrant’s best response function, the entrant’s
output becomes successively smaller as it adjusts to larger and larger output choices by the
incumbent. This decline limits the volume over which the entrant’s fixed cost _F_ 2 may be
spread. As a result, firm 2’s average total cost rises as its output falls. It is quite possible
that, at some point where the incumbent’s output _q_ 1 is sufficiently large, the market price
implied by the combined output of both firms will not cover the entrant’s average cost _even_
_when it produces the profit-maximizing output implied by its best response curve_ . If those

**Figure 12.3** The best response function of the incumbent firm depends on its first-stage choice of
capacity
For output less than _K_ 1, the incumbent will have a low marginal cost and operate on the higher response
function _L_ [′] _L_ . For output greater than _K_ 1, the incumbent will have a high marginal cost and operate on the lower
best response function _N_ [′] _N_ .


fixed costs had already been incurred they would be sunk and the entrant would continue
to produce. Yet because the cost _F_ 2 is only incurred if entry occurs, firm 2 can avoid this
expense by choosing not to enter. Obviously, it will do this if it foresees that the Nash
equilibrium if it does enter will not generate an operating profit sufficient to cover that cost
_F_ 2. We will return to this point below.

Now consider the incumbent’s initial capacity choice _K_ 1. It is clear that this choice will
critically affect the Nash equilibrium in stage two. The larger is _K_ 1, the more likely it is
that the state 2 equilibrium will occur along the best response function of the incumbent
that is further to the right, i.e., at a point at which the incumbent has a marginal cost of _w_
instead of _w_ + _r_ . How should the incumbent make this choice in stage 1?

A little reflection on our analysis in Chapter 11 should convince you that the incumbent’s
choice for _K_ 1 will never be less than the Stackelberg leader’s choice for output when it has

a marginal cost of _w_ _r_ . From that chapter we know that output level is _q_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_
+ = 2 _B_



2 _B_
and we will now denote this output level as _M_ 1. We also know that if firm 1 does produce



this level, firm 2’s best response is to set _q_ 2 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_
= 4 _B_



this level, firm 2’s best response is to set _q_ 2, an output level we will now
= 4 _B_

denote as _M_ 2. It is actually rather straightforward to understand why the incumbent will
never choose an initial capacity less than _M_ 1.

Consider the following. If the incumbent produces at the Stackelberg leader level, the
entrant will either stay out of the market entirely or, enter and produce its best response to
the Stackelberg output, namely, _M_ 2. The decision to stay out will reflect the fact that if it
does enter, the entrant’s fixed cost is sufficiently high that it will still lose money even if it
produces its best response to the incumbent’s Stackelberg output, i.e., when it produces _M_ 2.
In other words, if the incumbent’s production of _M_ 1 creates enough downward pressure on
price that the entrant cannot enter profitably at any output of _M_ 2 or less, then the incumbent
will be alone in the market as a monopolist. However, this means that the incumbent will
be producing exactly the right amount because we know that the Stackelberg leader output
_M_ 1 _is_ precisely the output level chosen by a monopolist. Indeed, that is why we designated
this output level as _M_ 1. Note that there is no real predation in this case. The incumbent is

**Figure 12.4** Possible incumbent capacity choices and entrant responses
The incumbent will make an initial capacity investment somewhere between points _M_ and _V_, i.e., in the interval
_M_ 1 to _V_ 1. The incumbent will choose the Stackelberg/monopoly capacity of _M_ 1 if: 1) the entrant cannot break
even at an output less than _M_ 2; or 2) the entrant can break even at output levels lower than _V_ 2. In the first case,
the incumbent is acting as a non-predatory profit-maximizing monopoly. In the second, entry can only be
limited—not prevented—by choosing the Stackelberg output. Predatory entry deterrence can occur when the
entrant can break even at output levels less than _M_ 2 but greater than _V_ 2 while on its best response curve _R_ 2.
Here, the incumbent’s investment in initial capacity in excess of _M_ 1 may prevent entry.


simply acting as the monopolist it is by producing the monopoly output and that in itself is
enough to block entry and confirm the incumbent’s monopoly status.

In the event that entry does occur, the incumbent will face an actual rival in stage 2. Yet
if entry cannot be prevented altogether it can still be limited. Moreover, the Stackelberg



leader output _M_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_
= 2 _B_



is by definition the best output choice for this purpose. It

limits the entrant to _M_ 2 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_

limits the entrant to _M_ 2 .
= 4 _B_

Note that for either of the two events above to be subgame perfect outcomes, the
incumbent’s commitment to producing the Stackelberg output _M_ 1 must be credible. In
particular, that output must be a best response to the entrant’s choice. Because _M_ 1 is
the monopoly output, this is clearly the case if the entrant does not enter. Yet unlike the
conventional Cournot model in which the incumbent faces a constant marginal cost of
_w_ + _r_ and therefore wishes to reduce its output below _M_ 1 when the rival produces _M_ 2,
the _ex ante_ investment in capacity also makes _M_ 1 a best response to the entrant’s choice
of _M_ 2 here. This is shown in Figure 12.4. In this diagram, the sloping dashed lines reflect
the incumbent’s best response curve under different marginal costs. The inner dashed curve
reflects a high marginal cost of _w_ + _r_ . The outer dashed line reflects the lower part of
the incumbent’s best response curve when it has a low marginal cost _w_ . The rest of that
best response is reflected in the solid line extension of the outer dashed line. That solid
incumbent’s best response function,line together with the vertical solid line through output _R_ 1. The entrant’s best response function _q_ 1 = _M_ 1 together describe the _R_ 2 is less
complicated as it reflects the high marginal cost _w_ + _r_ for all output choices.

_ex post_ Note that by investing in capacity marginal cost of just _w_ up to the output level _K_ 1 = _M_ 1 _ex ante_, the incumbent guarantees itself an _M_ 1. This is why we say that _R_ 1

We have just shown that the incumbent will never invest in initial capacity _K_ 1 _< M_ 1. In
addition to this lower bound on its initial investment there is also an upper bound. This is
the output level shown in Figure 12.4 as _V_ 1, corresponding to the Nash equilibrium when
the incumbent has the low marginal cost _w_ throughout its production. The reason should be
clear. While it is feasible for the incumbent to set _K_ 1 _> V_ 1, such higher outputs cannot be
part of a Nash equilibrium in a post-entry game. There is no point to the right of _V_ at which
the best response function of the incumbent _R_ 1 will intersect the best response function
of the entrant _R_ 2. Because the incumbent will never wish to produce more than _V_ 1 it will
never wish to invest in _K_ 1 _> V_ 1 initial capacity.

So far, we have shown that the incumbent will never make a stage one investment
The remaining question is whether the incumbent will ever choose an initial capacityin capacity either less than _M_ 1 or greater than _V_ 1, i.e., we must have _M_ 1 ≤ _K_ 1 ≤ _KV_ 11.
somewhere in between this upper and lower bound. That is, is it possible to have a subgame
perfect equilibrium in which _K_ 1 exceeds _M_ 1 but is less than _V_ 1? To see why this is possible,
consider Figure 12.4 again in which we have assumed an initial capacity choice of exactly



_K_ 1 _M_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_
= = 2 _B_



_K_ 1 _M_ 1 . This choice in turn implies that the stage two equilibrium will
= = 2 _B_

be at point _M_ (the Stackelberg point) with firm 1 producing at capacity _M_ 1 and firm 2
producing at _M_ 2 0.5 _M_ 1. Suppose though that in this equilibrium the entrant’s output _M_ 2
generates just enough operating profit to cover its fixed cost = _F_ 2. Hence, in this equilibrium
the entrant breaks even, i.e., the market price just covers the entrant’s average total cost.

Starting from this point, it is clear from equation (12.7) that if the incumbent increased
its output by one unit to _M_ 1 1, the entrant’s output would fall by [1] _/_ 2 unit. So, total output
would rise by a [1] _/_ 2 unit implying that the market price would fall. Yet because it would now +
be spreading its fixed overhead cost _F_ 2 over a smaller volume, the entrant’s average cost will
have risen. It follows that if it had just been breaking even in the previous market outcome,
the entrant will now be losing money because the price per unit has fallen and the cost per
unit has risen. Foreseeing this, however, the entrant would not enter in the first place. It is
better not to enter and earn zero rather than to enter and actually lose money. In other words,
this is a situation in which, by committing to an output of _M_ 1 1, the incumbent can deter
the entrant from entering the market at all. To be sure, the output + _M_ 1 1 is a little higher
+

_[(A]_ _[w]_ _[r)]_



than the profit-maximizing monopoly output of _M_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_
= 2 _B_



than the profit-maximizing monopoly output of _M_ 1 . However, as we have
= 2 _B_

seen, the commitment to a higher output level is what makes monopoly possible in the first
place. The lower output choice of _M_ 1 allows the entrant in to compete as a Stackelberg
follower. In the case at hand, that rivalry will reduce the incumbent’s profit more than
the cost of choosing slightly more capacity than it would have had it been a monopoly
not facing entry. In other words, the incumbent’s choice comes down to this: commit to



producing _M_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_
= 2 _B_



_M_ 2 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_

units which will permit the entrant to enter and produce
2 _B_



units so that the incumbent earns the profit of a Stackelberg leader, or
4 _B_



commit to _M_ 1 1 units which will prevent the entrant from coming into the market at all
+


Entry Deterrence and Predation 297



and leave the incumbent with the monopoly profit from producing _M_ 1 1 units, which is
a little less than a pure monopolist facing no entry. It should be clear that the latter choice +
will often be preferable. Indeed, even if it has to increase its initial capacity investment to
_M_ 1 2, or _M_ 1 _n_ in order to deter entry, the incumbent may find it profitable to do so, so
long as + _n_ is not so large that the incumbent commits to a level of output greater than + _V_ 1.

In sum, there are three possibilities in the Dixit (1980) model. One is that the entrant’s
fixed cost _F_ 2 is sufficiently high that it cannot operate profitably at any point along its
best response curve that has an output less than or equal to that of a Stackelberg follower
(≤ _M_ 2 in Figure 12.4). A second possible outcome is that the entrant’s fixed cost _F_ 2 is
sufficiently low that it can profitably enter even in a Nash equilibrium (point _V_ in Figure
12.4), in which the incumbent’s marginal cost is just _w_ reflecting only its labor input, so
that the entrant’s output is very low ( _V_ 2 or lower in Figure 12.4). In either of these cases, the



incumbent will find it optimal to commit to a capacity level of _K_ 1 _M_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_
= = 2 _B_



incumbent will find it optimal to commit to a capacity level of _K_ 1 _M_ 1 .
= = 2 _B_

If the entrant cannot enter, this is the right value because it is the output that a monopolist
would choose. If the entrant cannot be blocked, this is the output level that best limits the
extent of entry. However, there is a range of entrant fixed cost _F_ 2 not so large that the



incumbent’s commitment to a capacity level _K_ 1 _> M_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[w]_ [ −] _[r)]_

large enough such that commitment to capacitylosses for the entrant even if it makes its best response to the incumbent’s choice because _K_ 1 satisfying _V_ 1 ≥ _K_ 1 _> M_ 1 will imply
it will not achieve sufficient scale economies. In this case, predatory entry deterrence _is_
possible. We say predatory because the incumbent would not normally choose an initial
capacity of _K_ 1 _> M_ 1 except for the fact that this deters all entry, i.e., the action is profitable
only because of its entry deterring effect. This is the common definition of market predatory
behavior. Practice Problem 12.2 provides a numerical example of this analysis. Formal
analysis of the Dixit (1980) model may be found in the Appendix to this chapter.

**Figure 12.5** An example of entry deterrence
By initially investing in capacity of 32 in stage one, the incumbent firm insures that it will operate on the
response function _L_ [′] _L_ up to this output level in stage two. It also signals the potential entrant that the incumbent
will produce an output of _q_ 1 32 in this later stage. The entrant’s best response to this production level is to set
_q_ 2 14. However, the entrant will not cover its cost even with this best response. Therefore, by committing to ≥
an output of = _q_ 1 32, the incumbent deters any actual entry.
=


d. Now show that if the incumbent chooses a _K_ 1 32 in stage one then the entrant
in stage two can not earn a positive profit if it enters the market. In this case, the =
incumbent produces slightly more output than the monopolist and earns a profit
equal to $632, which is far greater than the profit earned in part (c).


The Dixit (1980) model makes clear that the incumbent firm has an advantage. More
importantly, the model reveals precisely the source of that advantage. It is the incumbent’s
ability to commit credibly to a particular output level in stage two by means of its choice of
capacity in stage one. Effectively, the incumbent commits to producing at least as much as
the initial capacity it installs because to produce any less amounts to throwing away some of
that investment, which is costly. In this respect, two further aspects of the model are worth
noting. First, when the incumbent deters entry it does so by deliberately _over_ -investing in
initial capacity. That is, installing an initial capacity greater than _M_ 1 would not be profitable
were it not for the fact that doing so eliminates the competition. Therefore, such capacity
expansion is predatory in the usual sense of the word.

Second, note that capacity expansion is credible as a deterrent strategy only to the extent
that capacity, once in place, is a sunk cost. If unused plant capacity can be sold off for a fee
_r_, then capacity is truly flexible and acquiring it does not reflect any real commitment on the
part of the firm. When such flexibility is not possible, which is often the case, then capacity
investment is a much more effective way to deter strategy than simply a promise to set a
low price. A price commitment is much less credible precisely because it may easily be
changed. Making a real commitment is typically costly. In the Dixit model, this cost reflects
the fact that the incumbent operates at a level of output above the profit-maximizing choice
of a pure monopoly. Yet it is precisely the act of making that commitment and incurring
that cost that makes monopoly possible. Practice Problem 12.3 offers another model of
predation by way of commitment.

Now think back to the empirical evidence on entry that we reviewed at the beginning
of the chapter. Two of the stylized facts are: (1) entry is commonly observed in a wide

cross-section of industries, and (2) market penetration as measured by market share is
relatively low for the entrants. These stylized facts are consistent with this model. The

advantage strategically to limit the impact of entry into its market—perhaps eliminating it
altogether.


described in Figure 12.6. The incumbent firm moves first and chooses whether or not to
spend _C_ as a means of enhancing its ability to be aggressive. The entrant moves next and
decides whether or not to enter the market. If the entrant enters then the incumbent decides
whether to accommodate its new rival or to fight. If the entrant does not enter, the incumbent
earns 8 minus _C_ if it has made that expenditure, and 8 if it has not. If the entrant does enter,
the incumbent’s payoffs depend on whether it fights or accommodates. Fighting when the
expenditure _C_ has been sunk yields a payoff of 3. Fighting is bloodier when the incumbent
has not spent _C_ . Accommodation when _C_ has been spent wastes that investment. The final
payoffs are described in parentheses, the first being the incumbent’s payoff and the second
the entrant’s.

12.3 PREEMPTION AND BUNDLING


A central force that drives the Dixit (1980) model is the presence of scale economies. The
fixed cost _F_ 2 of the entrant must be spread over a sufficiently large volume of output in
order for its average cost to be sufficiently low. This is often the case because the scale of a

plant or plant capacity is frequently not a continuous but a discrete variable—available only
in specific, fixed amounts. This same scale economy feature also plays a role in other entry
deterring strategies but ones that while similar, are logically distinct from the mechanism
of the Dixit (1980) model. Two of these strategies include an investment timing tactic
generally referred to as preemption and the strategic use of bundling. We discuss each in
turn.


Entry Deterrence and Predation 301



12.3.1 Preemption


While the intuition underlying the preemption analysis has long been understood, the first
formal analysis is due to Eaton and Lipsey (1979), and is set in a spatial market framework
of the type introduced in Chapters 4, 7, and 10. We illustrate the basic idea here using a
simple numerical Cournot example.

Consider a monopolist facing current demand given by: _Q_ = 30 − _P_, so that inverse
demand is _P_ = 30 − _Q_ . Operating in this market requires a plant, and these come only in
one size. Specifically, each plant can product any output up to a capacity of 15 units. Such a
plant can be built and utilized instantaneously and it will last forever, but acquiring a plant
of this capacity requires a one-time cost of $150. For simplicity, we assume all other costs
are zero. Hence, once the plant is built, the firm has a marginal cost of zero. By either the
twice-as-steep rule (Chapter 2) or the Cournot _N/(N_ + 1 _)_ rule (Chapter 9) with _N_ = 1, it
should be easy to see that the monopolist’s profit maximizing output is _Q_ _[M]_ = 15, implying
a monopoly price of _P_ _[M]_ = $15 and an operating profit of $225, or a net monopoly profit
of _π_ _[M]_ [ $75, after the cost of building the necessary plant is included.]



of _π_ 1 _[M]_

We now complicate this setting with two additional features. The first of these is that there [=][ $75, after the cost of building the necessary plant is included.]
is a potential entrant against whom the monopolist will compete as a Cournot duopolist
should entry actually occur. The second is that there is a subsequent market period in which
demand will grow to: _Q_ = 42 − _P_, i.e., it is known that the market will increase by 40
percent over time. If this seems like very rapid growth, think of a period as say ten years so
that it reflects an annual growth rate of 3.4 percent. Of course, this time element implies that
discounting is relevant. We will assume a periodic interest rate of 50 percent (4.1 percent a
year if a period is ten years). This implies that the discount factor _R_ = 0.67.

In the absence of the entry threat the incumbent would reason as follows. If it does
not add capacity by building another plant, it will sell 15 units in period two. Given the
increased demand, these units will sell at a price of $27 each and the firm will earn a
profit of $405. Given the discount factor, the present value of this profit is _R_ $405 = $270.
Alternatively, the firm can acquire a second plant for $150 either now or in the second
period. From a present value perspective, the latter option is clearly better as the present
value of the cost is then just� - _R_ $150 = $100. If it has a capacity of 30 units, then again,







use of the




_N_
_N_ + 1



rule (Section 9.5) implies that with _N_ = 1, the monopoly output in



period two is 21 units implying a price of $21, and a revenue of $441. In present value
terms, this has value of _R_ $441 = $294. Thus, the present value of adding a second plant to
expand capacity is $294 − $100 = $194. Because this is less than the present value ($405)
of simply producing at the current capacity of 15, the incumbent would not add any capacity
in the absence of any entry threat.

We now turn to the potential entrant. This firm observes the incumbent in period one and
decides then whether or not to enter in period two. To do so obviously requires that this
firm make the $150 investment in a plant. However, it has a choice about when it should
do this. It can invest in the plant now and pay a present value of $150 or wait one period
and pay a present value of _R_ $150 = $100. As a Cournot duopolist in the second period, the
_N/(N_ + 1 _)_ rule implies that both the entrant and the incumbent will produce 14 units in
period two. This will lead to a second period price of $14. Therefore, the present value of
the operating profit each firm will make is _R_ $196 = $130.67. Clearly, this is not enough to
cover the cost of investing in a plant today but is enough to cover the cost if investment is


302 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


delayed one period. Accordingly, the entrant will wait until the second period to acquire
the necessary plant to enter the market.

We now return to the incumbent. It understands the logic of the above analysis and can
see that the entrant will enter invest and enter in period two, which will end its monopoly
position. Is there a strategy that the incumbent can use to prevent this?

Here we make one further assumption. This is that while the two firms compete as
symmetric Cournot duopolists if they invest at the same time, each with a marginal cost
of zero, this is not the case if one firm builds capacity before the other. More specifically,
if one firm adds capacity before the other, it gains all the consumers it can serve up to its
new capacity. Only if demand is more than that expanded maximum will its rival gain any
customers. This may be because by being first, the firm can sign up consumers to a contract
before its rival, or for other reasons. In a spatial model setting, it reflects the fact that once
a firm has staked out a market position it cannot move. Whatever the reason, however, it
now gives the incumbent an incentive to invest in period one—to preempt the entrant’s
later expansion—and so to keep its monopoly position.

The logic of the incumbent’s new strategy is straightforward. There is clearly no point
in investing in new capacity in period two because the entrant will still find it profitable to
enter at that time. Thus, the incumbent’s choice comes down to either not investing at all as
per its original strategy or expanding capacity in period one. In the former case, the entrant
will enter and the incumbent will earn a second period duopoly operating profit of $196.
The present value of its profit over time will then be: −$150 + $225 + _R_ $196 = $205.66.
Alternatively, the incumbent can expand capacity now by initially building two plants
giving it a capacity of 30—more than enough to serve all the output demanded at the
duopoly price of $14. As a result, the entrant will see that entry is not profitable and the
incumbent will keep its monopoly position. Now, with a capacity of 30 in period two,
the incumbent will produce the profit-maximizing output of 21 units, implying a price of
$21 and an operating profit of $441. The present value of its cash flow in this case is:
−$300 + $225 + _R_ $441 = $219. It is evident then that investing in additional capacity
today is the more profitable strategy. Therefore, the incumbent will add an additional plant
in period one as a means to preempt the entrant and maintain its monopoly power.

The reason that the incumbent can afford to expand capacity in period one while the
entrant cannot is straightforward. The incumbent is fighting to protect monopoly profit
while the best that the entrant can hope for is a duopoly profit. Thus, the payoff to early
capacity expansion is greater for the incumbent than it is for the entrant.

Note two further features of the preemptive capacity expansion just described. First, the
strategy implies that in period one the incumbent will operate with a lot of excess capacity.
Specifically, it will have a capacity of 30 units and yet produce only half that amount.
Second, and even more important, note that the incumbent’s first-period capacity expansion
would not be profitable—and the incumbent would not do it—except for the fact that the
investment works to prevent entry. Viewed in this light, this preemptive strategy is truly
predatory.


12.3.2 Bundling to Deter Entry


In Chapter 8, we presented the use of bundling as both a price discrimination technique and
as a predatory tactic with particular reference to the Microsoft case. The underlying analysis
of this second role, due to Nalebuff (2004) among others, is worth reviewing briefly here


Entry Deterrence and Predation 303


with a simple numerical example. To this end, consider the following valuation of two
different goods, A and B, by each of ten potential buyers.


_Value of_ _Value of_ _Value of_
_Consumer_ _Product A_ _Product B_ _Both Products_


1 0.5 5.0 5.5
2 1.0 8.0 9.0
3 1.5 6.0 7.5
4 2.0 3.0 5.0
5 2.5 3.9 6.4
6 3.0 4.0 7.0
7 3.4 3.9 7.3
8 4.0 6.0 10.0
9 4.5 8.0 12.5
10 5.0 10.0 15.0


The current incumbent has a marginal cost of $1 per unit of each good. Each consumer
will buy at most one unit of either commodity, depending on whether the price exceeds
or is less than the consumer’s valuation. As a little experimentation will quickly reveal,
the profit-maximizing values for the two prices _PA_ and _PB_ if they are sold separately are
_PA_ $3 and _PB_ $3.9. At these prices, five consumers will buy product _A_ and nine will
buy product = _B_ . As a result, the incumbent will earn an operating profit of $10 in market =
_A_ and $26.1 in market _B_ for a total profit of $36.1. If instead the firm bundles the two
products as one packaged combination, the profit-maximizing bundle price is $6.4 at which
price eight consumers will buy the package. Because the production cost of the bundle is
$2, this strategy will lead to an operating profit of 8 × _(_ $6.4 − $2 _)_ = $35.2. Because this is
less than $36.1, this is a case in which the incumbent would not engage in pure bundling.

However, the potential entry of a rival might change matters. Suppose that a more efficient
rival for the _A_ market emerges. This rival offers a perfect substitute for the incumbent’s
product _A_ and does so at a lower cost. Specifically, the rival has the same fixed cost of
$5 but a marginal cost of zero. Clearly, if this firm enters, it can set a price _PA_ of (just
under) $1, and steal all of the incumbent’s market _A_ customers. The incumbent will still
earn an operating profit of $26.1 from its _B_ product line but nothing from its _A_ product
line. Meanwhile, by selling nine units of _A_ at a price of $1, the entrant would earn $9 in
revenue, which is more than enough to cover its variable cost ($0) and its fixed cost ($5).

Bundling may offer a means of preventing this entry. As noted in Chapter 8, bundling
allows the firm to attract those potential _A_ consumers who also place a large value on
product _B_ . If it can attract enough of these, it can make it impossible for the entrant to cover
its fixed overhead cost. For example, suppose that the incumbent offers goods _A_ and _B_
together as a bundle for a bundle price of $6, while the entrant continues to offer good _A_ at
price _PA_ $1. Each consumer now has the choice of buying either just product _A_ from the
entrant at a price of $1 or products = _A_ and _B_ together in a bundle offered by the incumbent
at a price of $6. Because consumers maximize the surplus they get from any purchase,
consumer 1 will buy neither alternative, while consumers 4 through 7 buy product _A_ alone.
The resultant revenue of $4, however, is not enough to cover the entrant’s fixed cost and
so entry would not occur (if it did it would soon be followed by exit). This leaves the
incumbent selling the bundle for $6 which, in the absence of any rival goods, will now sell
to eight consumers implying a net profit of 8 _(_ $6 − $2 _)_ = $32. Because this profit is more


304 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


than the incumbent earns if it accepts the rival’s entry and simply sets the profit-maximizing
price of $3.9 in the _B_ market, the incumbent will now find it profitable to bundle.

It is important to remember that the incumbent’s decision to bundle in the foregoing
example is only profitable because it keeps out new entrants. In the initial market setup
with no threat of entry the incumbent did not find bundling profitable. It is the ability of
bundling to prevent entry (or drive out existing rivals) that makes it a profitable strategy.
Again, this is what economists mean when they talk about predatory behavior.


12.4 PREDATORY ENTRY DETERRENCE: HISTORICAL CASES


Both the Dixit-Spence and the preemption models discussed in the preceding sections suggest that dominant firms may expand capacity rapidly as a means to deter entry. In one case,
this reflects a change in the cost structure that allows the firm to commit to aggressive pricing
if entry does occur. In the other case, it serves as a preemptive claim on future customers. Is
there any evidence that such capacity expansion motivated by rival entry actually occurs?

The answer to this question is, “It depends.” It would be inaccurate to say that the
available evidence supports the view that incumbents generally engage in such behavior.
For example, Lieberman (1987) examines the capital investment behavior of incumbent
and entrant firms in thirty-eight chemical industries in the face of excess capacity and
market growth. He finds no difference in the behavior of the two types of firms. This
suggests that the incumbents are not engaging in any capital investment for the purpose of
discouraging entry. Moreover, because investment commitment strategies are more likely
to occur in more capital-intensive industries, one might expect profitability to be higher
in such industries, all else equal, if preemptive expansion is the norm. However, an early
study by Caves and Ghemawat (1986) does not find support for this result.

Yet there is a difference between finding no evidence that capacity expansion motivated
by entry deterrence is an empirical regularity and finding no evidence that such behavior ever
occurs at all. To begin with, different conditions across markets have different implications
for what entry deterring behavior is to be expected. For example, while the models described
above have been set in a duopoly context, the reality is that there is often more than one
such potential rival. One possibility in this case is a free rider problem in which successful
entry by one firm will lead to many more entrants that erode that first entrant’s profitability.
In such a setting, it may take very little capacity expansion on the part of the incumbent to
deter any entry. So, the fact that we do not see such much excess capital investment in such
markets does not necessarily mean that entry deterrence is not taking place if there are many
potential entrants. A second free rider problem arises if there is more than one incumbent.
If one firm’s capacity expansion is enough to deter entry, each incumbent may decide to
let its current rivals take on that cost with the result that the observed excess investment in
entry-deterring capacity is again small. [9]

The difficulties in formally testing a generalized model of entry deterrence via capacity
expansion suggest that we must instead rely on the alternative approach of looking for
such behavior in specific, well-defined markets. This is the approach we take here. In the
following section, we present formal analysis based on evidence from hotel chains operating
in Texas.


9 See Gilbert and Vives (1986) for a contrary view in which capacity expansion grows as concentration falls
in a Cournot setting.


Entry Deterrence and Predation 305


Perhaps the clearest case of capacity expansion to deter entry is provided by the Alcoa
case of 1945 [ _U.S. v. Aluminum Co. of America_, 148 F. 2d 416 (1945)]. As the court noted
in finding Alcoa guilty of illegal monopolization, the dominant aluminum refiner expanded
capacity eight-fold between 1912 and 1934. The court felt that this prevented all but two
attempts to enter the industry both of which failed for lack of sufficient market share.

Weiman and Levin (1994) find that preemptive investment was an explicit tactic of
Southern Bell Telephone (SBT) in its effort to monopolize the local phone service market
in the central southern and eastern southern regions of the United States. Those markets
had become intensely competitive after the expiration of the Bell patents so that by 1902,
independent firms accounted for 60 percent of the local phone service in the region from
Virginia to Alabama and Florida. Weiman and Levin (1994) provide a detailed review
of company archival records showing that SBT’s leader, Edward J. Hall, launched an
aggressive capital expansion program to build a regional toll network in anticipation of
market development and with the explicit goal of preempting rivals. Within four years,
SBT had increased the geographic reach of its system from 2,000 to 8,600 pole miles. Even
more impressively, its calling capacity as measured by toll wire coverage grew from 5,000
to over 55,000 miles. All this was accompanied by an aggressive price-cutting campaign
both in markets where it faced competition and those where it expected it. Among other
features, this had the effect of restricting the investment funds available to competitors for
their own expansion whereas SBT was able to rely on heavy financing from its parent firm,
AT&T. The plan worked. By 1912, SBT had virtually complete control of the southern
local telephone market.

A third example is set in the town of Edmonton, Alberta, during the 1960s and early
1970s. The major retail grocer in Edmonton at that time was Safeway. However, in the
early 1960s other grocery chains began to enter the Edmonton market. These included two
Ontario firms, Loblaws and Dominion, and one Western Canada firm, Tom Boy. Between
1960 and 1963, these three firms opened twelve new stores in the Edmonton area. By 1964,
they were operating a total of twenty-one stores—not far behind Safeway’s then total of
twenty-five. Safeway could clearly see that continued entry by these and other firms was
a real possibility and it rapidly responded. It opened four new stores in 1963–64, another
four new stores in 1965–66, and then added five new stores in 1968. Moreover, Safeway
chose the locations of these new stores quite carefully. It located them in areas where due
to increasing population and the fact that no other store was currently close by, it looked
like a site of potential entry. In addition, just to drive home the seriousness of its intentions,
Safeway also located some of its new stores almost right next to locations where its rivals
also had a store. The strategy worked. By 1973, Safeway was operating thirty-five stores in
the Edmonton area whereas, due to closings, its three major rivals were operating just ten. [10]

Our final case comes from the market for titanium dioxide. This is a chemical additive
used as a whitener in such products as paint, paper, and plastics. At the time of our story,
it could be produced by any of three processes. One of these is a sulfate procedure that
uses ilmenite ore. One is a chloride process that uses rutile ore. Both of these processes
were known and available to all producers. The third process, however, is a special chloride
process that because of legal restrictions was known and available for use only by DuPont.
Like the sulfate process, DuPont’s procedure uses ilmenite ore. Yet like the generic chloride


10 Safeway was charged with monopolizing the Edmonton market in 1972 and, in late 1973, signed a consent
decree that, among other things, prohibited it from expanding its total square footage in Edmonton for
three-and-a-half-years. See von Hohenbalken and West (1986).


306 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


process, DuPont’s method emits little pollution. This is not the case with the sulfate
procedure, which has bad pollution affects.

Seven domestic firms were active in the titanium dioxide market during the 1970s. DuPont
was the largest of these with about 34 percent of the market, but NL industries—which
used the sulfate procedure—was a close second. Then, two events happened in the early
1970s that gave DuPont a decided advantage. First, rutile ore became more expensive,
implying that other producers using the generic chloride technique might have to cut back.
Second, strict pollution controls were imposed that made the sulfate process very expensive.
Suddenly, DuPont’s proprietary chloride technique based on ilmenite ore gave the company
an edge with respect to costs. A strategic firm would lose no time in exploiting that edge.
It would know that those producers using sulfate were not likely to expand. It might also
recognize that rutile could someday become cheap again (it did). If in addition the firm
expected, as did all participants in the titanium oxide market, that demand would grow, a
firm in DuPont’s position might wish to expand capacity immediately. This would preclude
those rivals using the rutile-based technique from expanding production when and if rutile
prices dropped and thus, permit the firm to capture the gap caused by market growth and
the declining sulfate-based production entirely for itself.

In fact, DuPont increased its capacity by over 60 percent in the next five years while
the industry in general stagnated. By 1977, DuPont’s market share had risen to 46 percent.
Moreover, when rival Kerr-McGee began to construct a new plant in 1974, just before
DuPont got its planned expansion going, DuPont began trumpeting its plans to the whole
industry. This seemed deliberately aimed at curtailing any expansion rival beyond that of
Kerr-McGee’s. [11]

In short, there appear to be a number of individual cases that support the use of capacity
expansion to deter entry. Recall moreover that the role of capacity expansion in the Dixit
model is to change the structure of a firm’s costs as opposed to its total costs. There may be
contractual and other ways to achieve this same result (see Reality Checkpoint, “Take or
Pay”). Thus, one cannot easily rule out the possibility that firms engage in some such efforts.

We will turn to an explicit econometric analysis of capacity expansion in the next section.
Before doing so, however, we ask whether there is also evidence on the use of bundling
as an entry deterrent. Here again, the answer is again individualized to specific cases.
Clearly, the issue of a large firm using bundling to damage a rival was at the heart of the
Microsoft case of 2000. [12] The critical argument there was that by bundling its own web
browser, _Internet Explorer_, into its general _Windows_ operating system at essentially a zero
price, Microsoft made it nearly impossible for the _Netscape Navigator_ browser to survive.
The issue also arose in connection with Microsoft’s _Media Player_, which the European
Commission also found harmful to competition. [13]

It is useful in this regard to note that bundling (and tying) can work in rather sophisticated
ways. For example, Goolsbee and Syverson (2008) document that airlines flying routes on
which the probability that discount airline Southwest has a high probability of entering cut


11 See Ghemawat (1984). See also Hall (1990) for evidence that DuPont’s action was consistent with the
Dixit model.
12 The judge’s decision in _United States v. Microsoft Corp_ . 97 F. Supp. 2d 59 (D.D.C. 2000) was explicit in
its findings of an illegal tying violation of the Sherman Act.
13 In its ruling in 2004, the European Commission found Microsoft guilty of illegal tying and fined the
company 497 million ($613 million). It also ordered Microsoft to share technical documents with rivals
and market a version of Windows without _Media Player_ . See _Microsoft Corp. v. Commission of the_
_European Communities, T-201/04_, March 24, 2004.


Entry Deterrence and Predation 307


prices dramatically in advance of any actual entry. Given airline frequent flyer programs
this not only expands the incumbents’ market demand immediately but also in the future.
In effect, frequent flyer programs may be thought of as the bundling of two goods
differentiated by time, namely, air travel today and air travel in the future. By locking in
future air passengers, this tactic may again make Southwest’s actual entry more difficult.


12.5 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: EXCESS CAPACITY EXPANSION
IN TEXAS HOTELS


Because the use of entry-deterring tactics reflects strategic consideration, we will not
observe its use by perfectly competitive firms. Moreover, entry deterrence efforts may
be limited even in less than perfectly competitive markets, given that each incumbent is
tempted to free ride on the entry deterring actions of others. Only when an incumbent has
a large market share will it find it worthwhile to engage in entry-deterring behavior. The
overall intuition then is that entry-deterring tactics ought to be more commonly employed
in more concentrated markets [14] and by larger firms.

Conlin and Kadiyali (2006) apply the foregoing insight to hotel markets across 254
counties in Texas over the years 1991 through 1997. Following the intuition of the Dixit
(1980) and Eaton and Lipsey (1979) models above, they identify entry deterrence with
excess capacity. [15] Their basic hypothesis is therefore that there will be more excess
capacity—a higher percentage of unoccupied rooms—in more concentrated markets and
for firms with larger market shares.

Conlin and Kadiyali (2006) apply four different definitions of the local hotel market. One
is simply the county: all hotels in Anderson county form one hotel market. A second is the
more local city market: all hotels in Houston form one market. Variations on each of these
two basic definitions come from considering which of three specific hotel segments—Full
Service, Limited Service, or Extended Stay—forms the core of the hotel’s business.
Again, examples would include the Anderson County Full Service hotel market and the
Houston Limited Service hotel market. With these data, Conlin and Kadiyali (2006) create
a Herfindahl Index for each such market. They also measure the percentage excess capacity
in each market in each year, defined as 100% × _(_ 1 − _the average occupancy rate)_ . They
then estimate the following regression for each market group across all the sample years:


Percentage Excess Capacity _m,t_ _αt_ _β(_ Herfindahl Index _)m,t_ _ϕXm,t_ _εm,t_ (12.9)
= + + +

The dependent variable is the percentage excess capacity in market _m_ and year _t_ . The
intercept varies over time to allow for the general economic conditions of each year. The
expectation is that the Herfindahl Index for market _m_ in year _t_ will have a positive effect
on market excess capacity, i.e., _β_ will be positive reflecting the hypothesis that more
concentrated markets will exhibit more entry-deterring behavior. However, the authors
control for a variety of other influences on excess capacity such as unemployment, per
capita income, population, taxes, etc., by including the vector of variables _Xm,t._ Of course,
there is also a random error term _εm,t_ associated with each regression observation. The


14 See Gilbert and Vives (1986) for an alternative view in which entry-deterring capacity expansion falls
with concentration.
15 Bulow et al. (1985) show that the incumbent in the Dixit model will have excess capacity when demand
is nonlinear.

∗Significant at 1% level;
∗∗Significant at 10% level


estimates of the key parameter _β_ for each of the four different market definition regressions
are shown above in Table 12.2.

The results tend to confirm the hypothesis that increased concentration is associated with
increased excess capacity in Texas hotel markets. All four of the estimated concentration
coefficients are positive and three are statistically significant. Thus, these results offer support
for the view that firms with market power pursue capacity expansion as an entry deterrent.

Yet while supportive of the basic hypothesis, Conlin and Kadiyali (2006) recognize
that these findings are far from conclusive. The reason is that while, as noted, they have
controlled for many other observable differences between markets, such as unemployment,
population, and so on, there may be other, unobservable differences that are driving these
results. For example, the presence of excess capacity may cause hotels to exit a local market.
Moreover, it may be the smallest hotels that leave first. As these small hotels exit, market
concentration increases giving rise to a positive correlation between excess capacity and
concentration that does not at all reflect an entry-deterring strategy. Similarly, it may be
that highly concentrated markets permit tacit collusion among firms to a greater extent than
anticipated when their capacity was first installed with the result that suppressing output
now yields excess capacity. Once again the data would then show a positive correlation
between concentration and excess capacity that should not be attributed to entry deterrence.

One way to deal with the unobservable differences across markets is to put in a “fixed
effects” term, which amounts to letting the regression intercept be different for each market.
These fixed effects terms will pick up all the differences between markets—observed or
unobserved, unrelated to time. The bad news, though, is that this means that the identification
of a concentration effect comes from the variation over time within a market and not from
the differences in concentration across market. This variation is not sufficiently large to yield
useful estimates if these “fixed effects” are included in the regression model of equation
(12.9). Therefore, Conlin and Kadiyali (2006) turn to an alternative specification that looks
at the relation between an individual firm’s excess capacity and that firm’s market share.

Specifically, using _i_ to index firms; _m_ to index market; and _t_ to index time, Conlin and
Kadiyali (2006) estimate the following regression:



Excess Capacit _yi,m,t_ Constant _m,t_ _γ_ Market Share _i,m,t_
= +



_ρ(_ Share in Total Capacity of Related Hotels _)i,m,t_
+



_η(_ Incumbent Expansion _)i,m,t_ _θ(_ Entrant Expansion _)i,m,t_ _ui,m,t_
+ + +

**Table 12.3** Effect of market share on excess capacity in local texas hotels

City 0.106 [∗] (0.022)
City-Sector 0.157 [∗] (0.300)


∗Significant at 1% level.


The first term in equation (12.10) directly addresses the hypothesized effect. If large
firms keep excess capacity as part of an entry deterring strategy, the estimate of _γ_ will be
positive. The other variables pick up: 1) whether or not the firm is affiliated with other
firms in the market, e.g., Holiday Inn is affiliated with Holiday Express; 2) whether the firm
is an incumbent that has recently expanded; or 3) whether the firm is an entrant that has
recently expanded. Because the estimation is conducted at the firm level and there is a lot
of variation in a firm’s share of a specific market over time, this equation _can_ be estimated
using the fixed effects estimator. The results are shown in Table 12.3 below.

Here again, the effects are supportive of the use of excess capacity as an entry-deterring
device. Excess capacity rises significantly with an increase in a firm’s market share. Overall,
the marginal effect of an increase of 10 percentage points in the firm’s market share is an
increase of 1.2 percentage points in a firm’s excess capacity. While again, there may be other
explanations behind these findings other than entry deterrence, the results in Table 12.3
when added to those in Table 12.2 offer fairly compelling evidence that entry deterrence is
at least part of the explanation.


**Summary**



This chapter has investigated the ability of firms
to maintain a dominant market position in their
industry for a prolonged period of time. Both
anecdotal and formal evidence indicate that such
sustained market power is a widespread feature.
In turn, this implies that the entry of new rivals
who can compete away an incumbent firm’s profits is not as powerful in the real world as it is
suggested to be in basic microeconomic texts.
Something permits an incumbent to preserve its
market position and successfully defend itself
against rival entry.

By itself, a finding that market structures have
evolved in a manner that maintains or even
strengthens the dominance of initial firms over
time is not evidence of entry deterrence. Random processes such as Gibrat’s Law suggest
that asymmetrically dominated markets are the
norm. Richer theoretical models such as Klepper’s (2002), in which innovation becomes easier



as firms get larger and more experienced, also
yield oligopoly as their equilibrium outcome.
Yet the additional evidence that when entry does
occur it is on a small scale and often doomed to
failure, along with the experiences that motivated
the antitrust laws initially and the numerous court
cases and anecdotal observations that have followed, all coalesce into a clear enough pattern
that one cannot help but be suspicious that entry
is being deterred. That suspicion can only be
confirmed or denied, however, if one has a logically consistent model in which such predation
is rational and formal evidence that supports that
analysis.

Spence (1977), Eaton and Lipsey (1979), Dixit
(1980), and Nalebuff (2004) are all examples of
modern efforts to develop formal models of entry
deterrence. These models hinge on the ability
of incumbent firms to commit to a large output in the face of entry, typically by making a


310 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy



substantial capital investment. Numerous case
studies suggest that firms such as Alcoa and
DuPont have used such entry-deterring tactics.
Statistical documentation of this behavior as an
empirical regularity is more difficult, but work
such as Conlin and Kadiyali (2006) does suggest a clear linkage between market power and
excess capital capacity, consistent with models
of entry deterring behavior. Thus, there is reason
to believe that such tactics are common among
real-world firms. Still it must be recognized that
it is often difficult to distinguish predation from
normal competitive behavior.

In both theory and practice, there is a distinction between preventing the entry of new firms
and driving existing ones out of business. In this
chapter we have focused on the issue of entry
deterrence, or predatory conduct, and done so in
a setting of complete information. While some
of these tactics will apply equally well to driving
rivals out rather than just not letting them in,
we will address explicit efforts to force rivals to
exit in the next chapter. We will also extend our
analysis of incumbent response to entry in the
context of incomplete information.

will be to produce such that = 0.) What
is the incumbent firm’s profit?


2. Return to Problem 1. Suppose that the
incumbent and the entrant instead will play
a Cournot game if and when the entrant
enters. What are firms’ profits in this case?
Is it reasonable to believe that the incumbent will try and commit to _q_ ∗ in order to
deter entry? Why?


3. Suppose that the inverse demand function
is described by: _P_ 100 2 _(q_ 1 _q_ 2 _)_,
where _q_ 1 is the output of the incumbent =   - +
firm and _q_ 2 is the output of the entrant. Let
the labor cost per unit _w_ = 20 and capital
cost per unit be _r_ = 20. In addition, let each
firm have a fixed cost of _F_ 1 _F_ 2 $100.

that in stage two the incumbent’s best

function in stage two is _q_ 2 15

4. Return to Problem 3. Now show that if the
incumbent commits to a production capacity of =15, the entrant will do best by
producing 7.5 and earn a profit of $12.5,
while the incumbent earns a profit of $125.

commits in stage one to a production capacity = 16 then the entrant’s

a. If the incumbent acts as a simple
monopolist, what price will it charge
and what level of output will it produce?
b. Suppose now that a foreign producer
of calculators is considering exporting
to the US market. Because of transportation costs and tariffs this foreign
firm faces some cost disadvantage vis
`a-vis the domestic incumbent. Specifically the foreign firm’s cost schedules are: TC _(qE)_ 10 _qE_ 0.025 and
MC _(qE)_ 10 _._ =05 _qE_ . Suppose that +

the incumbent firm is committed to
the monopoly level of output. What is
the demand curve faced by the potential entrant? Write it down. Facing
this demand, what level of output will
the foreign firm actually export to the
domestic market? What will be the new
industry price?
c. To what level of output would the
incumbent firm have to commit in
order to deter the foreign firm from
entering the market? (Hint: You must
solve for output level _q_ ∗ with the property that if the entrant believes that the
incumbent will produce _q_ ∗, then the

not earn a positive profit. =
b. In light of your answer to 2(d), show
that committing to a production capacity of 16, gives the incumbent a profit
of $348.


5. Two firms, firm 1 and 2, must decide
whether to enter a new industry. Industry demand is described by _P_ = 900 − _Q_,
where _Q_ _q_ 1 _q_ 2 _, qj_ 0. To enter the
industry a firm must build a production = + ≥
facility of one of two types: small or large.
A small facility requires an investment of
$50,000 and allows the firm to produce as
many as 100 units of the good at a unit
production cost of zero. Alternatively, the
firm can pay $175,000 to construct a large
facility that will allow the firm to produce
any number of units of output at zero unit
cost. A firm with a small production facility
is capacity constrained whereas a firm with
a large facility is not. Firm 1 makes the
entry decision first. It must choose whether
to enter and, if it enters, what kind of production facility to build. After observing
firm 1’s action, firm 2 chooses from the
same set of alternatives. If only one firm
enters the industry then it selects a quantity
of output and sells it at the corresponding price. If both firms are in the industry
they compete as Cournot firms. All output
decisions in the market stage are subject
to the capacity constraints of the production facilities. The market lasts for only one
period.
a. Draw the extensive tree that represents
the entry game being played between 1
and 2.
b. What is the outcome? Does firm 1 enter
and at what size? Does firm 2 enter and
at what size?


6. Let the demand for hand-blown glass vases
be given by _q_ = 70000 − 2000 _P_, where _q_
is the quantity of glass vases consumed per
year and _P_ is the dollar price of a vase. Suppose that there are 1000 identical small sellers of these glass vases. The marginal cost
function of such a seller is MC _(q)_ = _q_ + 5,
where _q_ is the firm’s output.
a. Assuming that each small seller acts as
a price taker in this market derive the



Entry Deterrence and Predation 311


market supply curve, and the equilibrium price and quantity traded.
b. Suppose that a new mechanized technique of producing vases is discovered
and monopolized by some firm, call it
firm B for “BIG.” Using this technique,
vases can be produced at a constant
average and marginal cost of $15 per
vase. Consumers cannot tell the difference between vases produced by the
old and the new technique. Given the
existence of the fringe of small sellers
what is the demand curve facing firm
B?
c. Facing this demand curve, what is the
profit-maximizing quantity produced
by firm B? What is the price that it
sets and the overall amount of vases
traded in the market?


7. There are ten consumers in the markets for
widgets and gadgets. Consumer valuations
for each good are positively correlated, as
shown in the tables below, and consumers
will buy at most one unit of either good.
The incumbent has a monopoly in each
product. Producing each incurs a marginal
cost of $40. There is also a fixed cost of
$20 associated with the production of each
good.

312 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy



c. Imagine that there is a potential entrant
in the gadget market selling an identical product to the incumbent’s and
competing in price. If the entrant has
a marginal cost of $30 per unit and
a fixed cost of $20, can the entrant
enter and compete successfully against
the incumbent in the gadget market if
the incumbent sells gadgets separately
from widgets?
d. Show that if the incumbent sells widgets and gadgets only as a bundle of
one unit of each good at a price of $100
it will successfully keep the entrant

incumbent?
