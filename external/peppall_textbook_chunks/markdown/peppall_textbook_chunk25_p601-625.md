the extra funds needed to ensure that the innovator breaks even. However, in the absence of
government intervention, the fact that _S > ρ_ means that no such R&D efforts will occur. [3]

This brings us back to the role of patent length in influencing innovative activity. Recall
that _S_ = _K/M_ and relax our assumption that the discount factor is zero. Then we can rewrite
_S_ as _S(T )_ = _K/M(T ),_ where _M(T )_ is the discounted value of monopoly profits with a
patent of length _T_ . Clearly, _S_ gets smaller as _T_ increases. (Formally, _dS(T )/dT <_ 0 _._ ) This
brings attention to the obvious parameter that the Patent Office can influence in _S(T )_ is patent
length as measured by _T_ . Suppose first that _T_ is “short,” giving _S(T )_ = _S_ 1 in Figure 21.2.
Then there is no innovation to develop the new product. If, however, patent length is
increased, giving _S(T )_ = _S_ 2 in Figure 21.2, one firm will be induced to undertake the
innovation. Because this is profitable for the firm _and_ is likely to generate consumer surplus
even during the period of patent protection, this can be expected to be socially desirable.

So far so good. Note, however, that if patent length is increased still further, giving
_S(T )_ = _S_ 3 in Figure 21.2, both firms will be induced to undertake the innovation and we
have socially wasteful innovation. In other words, we have yet another reason for being
cautious in the design of patent policy. Very lengthy patents are attractive to firms and so
may induce socially wasteful patent races.


is _P_ = 100 − 2 _Q,_ and that each firm believes that it will be able to produce this good at a
unit cost of _c_ = $50. Assume further that the discount factor _R_ is so small that each firm
cares only about the one-period profit it will make. (Alternatively, assume that one period
is of a very long duration, say, thirty years or more.) The probability that such a lab will be
successful and actually produce a discovery is _ρ_ = 0 _._ 8 _._

b. Show that if each firm sets up a lab and if both labs are successful, then each firm will
earn a profit (before paying for the research) of $138.89. Consumer surplus in this case
will be $277.78

case, now including the cost, _K,_ of establishing an R&D division.

research lab is $375 _,_ and if two research labs are established, is $416.67. Hence, show
that the second lab is socially desirable only if _K <_ $141.67 _._


We have focused on the risk that patent races may yield either too much or too little R&D
investment. Another issue to consider is the possibility that patent races lead firms to pursue
more risky innovations. The intuition behind this argument can be illustrated fairly simply.

consequences for social welfare.




590 Non-Price Competition


Suppose that firms can choose to invest either in a relatively safe R&D route that has an
expected discovery time uniformly distributed between one and three years or a more risky
route that has an expected time of discovery uniformly distributed between zero and four
years. Both discoveries are equally costly, and both are expected to become redundant or
worthless in five years’ time. We also assume that each discovery generates the same profit
of $1 million per period during the time that it is utilized and is protected from imitation by
a patent.

Because the expected date of discovery is the same, namely two years for both routes,
then assuming neither firm had any competition, a risk-neutral firm considering them would
be indifferent between the two options, and a risk-averse firm would go for the less risky
route. However, when firms are involved in a patent race, competition between the firms
may lead them to choose the more variable or risky route in which success can come
anytime between zero and four years. [4] The reason is once again that when innovation is
protected from imitation, all that matters is winning the race. The second-place firm loses
the same amount no matter how close it is behind the winner. In our example, if my rival
chooses the less risky R&D route, I have an incentive to choose the more risky route,
because this offers the possibility of success and a quick victory right away. Similarly, if my
rival adopts the risky strategy, I can see that unless I do the same there is a real possibility
that I will be left behind in the race. Of course, my rival can work out all this too. The result
is that both of us choose the more risky route.


21.4 MONOPOLY POWER AND “SLEEPING PATENTS”


Another way in which the patent system and innovative competition can interact to affect
market structure is through “sleeping patents.” Many students at first find it puzzling that
firms may hold a large number of patents all related to the same process or product, many
of which are never acted upon. (Return to Table 21.1 for some evidence on this point.)
What possible reason can a firm have to earn patent rights to products and processes that it
never uses, that is, what could be the rationale for a firm to create and hold what is called a
“sleeping patent”?

One important motivation for holding a sleeping patent is to create a buffer of protection
for the monopoly profits generated by the truly valuable patent. Legal history and economic
analysis have both documented that the protection granted by a single patent is often very
limited. Edwin Mansfield and his associates (1981) found in a study of forty-eight patented
new products, that 60 percent were imitated within four years of their introduction. Firms
often can and do “invent around” patent protection, as we discussed earlier in the case of
pharmaceuticals. Frequently, there are several technical solutions to a particular problem
such as is the case for the production of the whitening agent, titanium oxide. Each such
alternative production technique is a threat to the firm holding a patent on a particular
process or product. Hence, by patenting as many of these alternatives as it can, a firm
increases the protection it has in using whatever process it actually decides upon.

Suppose, for example, that market demand is given by _P_ = 100 − _Q_ and that the
incumbent firm has a proprietary technology with a constant marginal cost of _cI_ $20. The
firm has a patent that protects its technology. Let us also suppose that this technology is so =
efficient that entry is not possible, and thus the incumbent is free to set the monopoly price


4 This type of case is discussed in Klette and de Meza (1986).


Patents and Patent Policy 591


and earn a monopoly profit each period of _π_ _[m]_ _(cI_ 20 _)_ . To be precise, the monopolist will
sell 40 units at a price of $60 and earn a profit of $1,600 = _._

Assume now that there is also an alternative technology that the monopolist has
discovered, which permits production at the higher constant marginal cost of _c_ E $30.
Clearly, the monopolist has no incentive to switch to this technology. However, if $30 is =
a low enough unit cost so that another firm could acquire this technology and enter the
industry, then the incumbent’s current monopoly would be eroded. The entrant would either
be the high-cost member of a Cournot duopoly or, if Bertrand competition prevailed, the
entrant’s cost based on using this alternative technology would at least establish a clear
upper bound of $30 on the incumbent’s price—one that we know (by construction of the
example) is below the incumbent’s current monopoly price.

It is easy to see that the incumbent has an incentive to patent the higher-cost technology
as well as the lower-cost one, even though it will never use this alternative, higher-cost
technology. By acquiring this patent and letting it lie dormant or sleep, the incumbent
strengthens its hold on its monopoly position. The question is whether the incumbent’s
incentive to acquire the higher-cost technology is so strong that it actually exceeds the
incentive of the entrant to acquire the technology and enter.

The surprising answer is yes. Acquiring a patent to the high-cost technology is worth more
to the incumbent monopolist than to its potential rival. This is obvious in the case of Bertrand
competition. In that case, the rival’s entry with a high unit cost of $30 would provoke a price
war in which the incumbent would have to lower its price from its current monopoly level to
the marginal cost of the entrant, namely, $30. Of course, when this happens, the entrant earns
nothing. The incumbent, however, because of its lower cost, will still earn $30 − $20 = $10
per unit. At this price, the incumbent will now sell $70 units and earn a profit of $700. This
is less than what it earned previously but still better than nothing. From this it should be
clear why the monopolist places a greater value on discovering the alternative process than
does the entrant. Under Bertrand competition, the entrant never earns any money with this
innovation. Hence, for the entrant, discovering the process is worthless. Yet, even though
the entrant cannot make money with this higher-cost process, it can put pressure on the
incumbent. Specifically, discovery of the process by the entrant imposes a limit of $700 on
the incumbent’s profit. So, it is worth $900 _(_ = $1600 − $700 _)_ to the incumbent to acquire
the process first and thereby prevent the imposition of this profit ceiling.

The same basic result holds in a Cournot model. The gain to the monopolist from
acquiring the second, sleeping patent on the high-cost process is the profit earned as
a monopoly firm using the low-cost technology, _π_ _[m]_ _(cI_ 20 _)_ $1600 _,_ less the profit
earned as a duopoly firm with the low-cost technology facing a rival with the high-cost = =

profit, taken to be zero. [5] Therefore, the entrant’s net gain from developing the technology
is $400. Hence, in the Cournot case also, the gain to the monopolist incumbent exceeds that
of the potential entrant.

The reason that the incumbent monopolist is more willing than a potential rival to develop
the high-cost process and patent it is now familiar. It is because the monopolist has a lot
more at stake. If it wins the race, it gets to keep its current monopoly position. If the entrant

wins the race, the best the entrant can hope for is to be the high-cost member of a duopoly.
The incumbent acquires the patent on the high-cost process to make sure that nobody else
will use it. Viewed in this light, acquiring “sleeping patents” amounts to broadening the
patent’s width.

The data in Table 21.2 provide some empirical support for this proposition. These data
are drawn from a PatVal-EU survey of 9,017 patents issued by the European Patent Office
between 1993 and 1997 to individuals located in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Spain, and the United Kingdom. [6] The survey asked the inventors to rate the importance
that they put on different motives for patenting.

In this table, “blocking competitors” refers to sleeping patents that are used specifically
for the strategic reasons we have been discussing in this section (what the researchers term
sleeping patents are patents that, according to the respondents, were not used for any of the
other six purposes identified in the table). As can be seen, large companies used fewer of
their patents and used a higher proportion of patents for blocking purposes than did medium
sized or small companies, consistent with our “protecting monopoly power” analysis.

Historic examples of an incumbent using a “sleeping patent” strategy to inhibit rival
expansion are common. Alcoa achieved its dominant market position largely on the strength
of Charles Martin Hall’s electrolytic process for the reduction of aluminum bauxite ore.
Fifteen years after it was formed, the company bought up the competing Bradley patents on
an alternative reduction process—one that Alcoa never used. Similarly, Du Pont’s patent
of the synthetic fiber nylon was accompanied by the company’s filing of literally hundreds
of other patents all based on variants of the same molecule. Perhaps the best example of
the use of sleeping patents comes from Hollywood. Film companies regularly buy the film
rights to books, stage plays, and submitted screenplays knowing that many of these script
ideas will never be turned into a final product. In part, each film company simply wants to
make sure that a rival producer does not get the chance to make a film based on this material.


21.5 PATENT LICENSING


Efficiency requires that the existing stock of information should be available to all buyers
at the marginal cost involved in sharing such knowledge. However, because this implies a
“price for information” of near zero, it leaves little incentive for anyone to produce new

Patents and Patent Policy 593


information as embodied in new goods or new technologies. Patent protection is an effort
to cut a middle path between these two pressures. The firm receiving the patent is protected
(to some extent) from sharing its discovery with others for free. In fact, it does not have to
share it at all.

One interesting possibility is that an innovating firm might be willing to share its technical
advance with other firms for a price. When this happens, it results in a licensing agreement
between the patent owner and the patent user. Not sharing the patent at all can be interpreted
as charging a very high (perhaps infinite) licensing fee. Actual licensing reflects a movement
away from such a high fee and toward a price for information that is closer to—if still
some way off—the efficient charge of near zero. In this sense, the licensing of a patent
is unambiguously a good thing. The question is, does an innovating firm have a profit
incentive to license its discovery?

The most obvious case in which a firm would prefer to license an innovation is if the
licensee operates in a totally different market from the licensor. For example, a US firm that
has a patent on a particular product or process innovation may prefer to license a foreign
firm to use this patent (for a fee, of course) rather than setting up a foreign subsidiary or
exporting. About the only reasons for not licensing are, first, that the licensor may not be
able to secure a satisfactory payment for the license except after extensive bargaining. If
such negotiations will be prolonged, either or both parties may decide that it is simply not
worthwhile. Second, the licensor may fear that, ultimately, the foreign licensee will produce
in some market where it competes directly with the licensor. Finally, there is the fear that
the licensee may—by acquiring rights to use the new process or product—improve its
ability to develop the next generation of this technology by itself and thereby enhance its
future ability to compete.

While these fears are undoubtedly real, there are considerable offsetting benefits to
licensing agreements. Licensing gains revenue for the innovator today. Because the cost of
sharing the information is low, any such revenue translates into profit.

What about cases, though, where the licensor and licensee are not separated by large
geographic distance but instead are competitors in the same market? Will an innovating
firm license its patented discovery for use by some or all of its rivals? The answer depends
on market structure and the strength of competition in the market.


21.5.1 The Incentive for an Oligopolist to License a
Nondrastic Innovation


Consider the toughest type of competition—price competition between firms making
identical products. A firm that obtains a patent on a new technology that permits it to sell at
a lower cost has little incentive to license the process to a competitor. Suppose, for example,
that both firms are currently selling at a price equal to their (constant) marginal cost of $15
and that one firm has discovered a way to reduce this cost to $12. Without licensing its
rival, the innovating firm can supply the entire market at $14.99 and drive its competitor
from the market while earning a $2.99 profit on every unit sold. If it tries to sell a license to
its rival, the only sensible royalty rate is $2.99 per unit. The rival firm will pay no higher
royalty because then it will be unable to compete as its cost will be $12 plus the royalty,
which is no better than its current cost of $15. At any lower royalty, the rival will force
the innovating firm to lower its price below the current $14.99. But at a royalty of exactly
$2.99 _,_ both firms will sell at $14.99 and split the market. The licensing firm loses $2.99 on


594 Non-Price Competition


those units it would have sold if it had not licensed but stayed a monopolist. It then gains
the $2.99 back as a royalty payment on each of those same units now sold by its rival. In
short, licensing gains the innovator nothing. Hence, the incentive to license is very small
when the competition is Bertrand. [7]

By contrast, consider a market in which firms are Cournot competitors. In this case,
a patent holder has a strong incentive to license, as a simple example shows. Assume
that demand for the product in question is _P_ = 120 − _Q_ and that there are three firms
in the market, each with constant marginal costs of $60. Then we know from our earlier
analysis that the Cournot equilibrium output of each firm is 15 units, total output is 45, the
equilibrium price is $75 _,_ and each firm earns a profit of $225 _._

Suppose now that one firm makes a nondrastic process innovation lowering its cost to
$40 per unit, while the other two firms continue to produce at the higher value of $60
per unit. If the innovating firm does not license the innovation, then the Cournot–Nash
equilibrium price falls to $70. The innovating firm increases its output to 30 units, while
the other, high-cost firms reduce their outputs to 10 units each. Profit to the innovating firm
increases to $900 while profit to each of the other firms falls to $100 _._ [8]

Now assume that the innovating firm agrees to license the innovation to its rivals at a
fee of $10 per unit that each rival produces. This means that the innovator’s costs are $40
per unit and the other firms’ costs are $50 per unit. At the post-licensing equilibrium the
innovating firm’s output is 25 units while the other firms produce 15 units each so that price
is $65. The profit of the innovating firm is now $25 per unit on its own sales plus $10 per
unit on the sales of its two rivals, giving a total profit of $925. For each non-innovating
firm, profit is $15 per unit, giving each firm profit of $225. The rivals’ profits are just as
high and the innovator’s profit is higher with licensing rather than without it.

Licensing is, indeed, potentially quite profitable. Moreover, the licensing fee of $10
that we have chosen is not the best that the innovating firm can do. [9] We show in the
Appendix that the innovator should actually push the license price as close as possible to
the difference in costs that the innovation generates—in our example, as close as possible
to $20. Suppose for example that the innovator charges a royalty rate of $20 per unit (more
accurately, $19.99). This restores the equilibrium with the innovation but without licensing.
The innovator produces 30 units and each non-innovating firm 10 units, giving a product
price of $70. Profit of each non-innovating firm is, once again, $100 because their costs
are $60 per unit. By contrast, profit of the licensing firm is $30 per unit on its own output
and $20 per unit on the output of its rivals, giving the licensor a total profit of $1,300.
The message then is clear. For a Cournot firm with a nondrastic innovation, licensing its
discovery is very attractive.


7 For the patent holder that is selling in a _differentiated products market_, the analysis is a bit more
complicated. Here, each additional license has three effects. First, it adds licensing revenue. Second,
however, it makes the market more competitive and hurts the patent holder in its product market. Third,
and as a result of the second effect, each additional license sold drives down the market value of licenses
in general. In other words, the demand curve for licenses will be downward sloping because the more that
are sold, the more competitive is the market and therefore the less any licensee can afford to pay for a
license. Because the patent holder is the monopoly supplier of such licenses, its marginal revenue curve
for selling will lie below the demand curve for licenses.
8 These numbers come from simple application of the equations for the Cournot-Nash equilibrium that we
have developed in previous chapters.
9 For details see Katz and Shapiro (1985).


Patents and Patent Policy 595


21.5.2 Licensing, Drastic Innovations, and Monopoly Power


What if the innovation had been drastic? Or what if the industry had been a monopoly
instead of an oligopoly? Consider each question in turn. If one firm in a Cournot oligopoly
patents a drastic innovation, it will not want to license its discovery. Take the simple
case of a duopoly. Without licensing, the innovating firm becomes a monopoly. The
innovation offers such a dramatic reduction in cost that even when it sets the monopoly
price associated with that cost, it still underprices its old duopolist rival, while earning
considerable monopoly profit. Here, nothing can be gained by licensing. If the rival is
permitted to compete, the market returns to being a duopoly except at lower cost. The
most the rival would ever pay for the license is therefore its share of the duopoly profit.
Combining this with the innovator’s share would yield the innovator a total profit with
licensing equal to the profit earned by two duopoly firms. Yet we know that—because the
firms cannot collude—this is generally a smaller amount than the innovating firm could
earn as a pure monopolist without licensing. Accordingly, a Cournot firm that makes a
drastic innovation will not share its discovery with rivals even for a fee. Of course, this is
also true for firms engaged in Bertrand competition. In all such cases, the oligopolist that
makes a truly dramatic breakthrough may be expected to emerge as a monopolist driving
its former competitors from the field.

Turning next to the case of monopoly in the first place, we now have to permit the
innovation to take place at an outside firm or laboratory if we are to consider any licensing.
(If the monopolist makes the innovation itself, there is no other firm to which it can license!)
It should be clear that in such cases the innovating firm will license the monopolist. Because
the patent holder is not active in the market, the only way it can obtain any revenue from
its discovery is to sell or license it to the monopolist.

The interesting point in this case is the precise form that such a licensing contract should
take. Should the licensor charge a royalty of _X_ per unit? Or should it charge a fixed fee
independent of output? Or should it use some combination of both? You should recognize
that charging a per unit royalty—while it has the advantage that it relates revenue directly
to usage—runs into the familiar problem of double-marginalization (see Chapters 16, 17,
and 18). It raises the licensed firm’s marginal cost so that—after that firm adds its
markup—the price to the final consumer is doubly distorted and sales volume is restricted.
In this light, it should not be surprising that the innovating lab will do best by using a
two-part tariff. The principal part of this scheme will be a fixed fee (per month or per year).
The second part will be a small royalty per unit reflecting any per unit cost the patent holder
incurs in licensing its technology. For a transfer of pure information, this per unit charge
will be zero. But if the patent holder needs to offer services or technical advice that increases
with the frequency with which the technology is used, this fee will be positive. The licensing
contract is much like a franchising contract. In principle, the inventor can appropriate all
the increased profit that the invention brings if the contract is written correctly, that is, with
a fixed fee exactly equal to that additional profit. In practice, however, the patent holder’s
bargaining position will usually not be strong enough to achieve this outcome. When the
manufacturer has a monopoly in the product market, the inventor needs the manufacturer
just as much as the manufacturer needs the inventor.


_Patent Licensing, Social Welfare, and Public Policy_


The foregoing cases indicate that most of the time an innovator has an interest in licensing
its discovery. This is a reassuring result because our intuition is that licensing is typically a


596 Non-Price Competition


desirable outcome. Katz and Shapiro (1985) have provided a formal argument that licensing
nearly always increases social welfare. Specifically, they show that licensing is socially
desirable if total output increases as a result of the licensing activity. To see why, note
that licensing will not occur unless it raises profit for both the innovating firm and in total.
The license agreement will not be signed unless the licensees see some benefit from it
and will not be offered unless the licensor also sees some benefit from it. If, in addition
to this mutual gain in profit, the license agreement increases total output, then the price
will be lower and consumer surplus will be increased too. In other words, if the license
agreement increases total output, both consumers and producers gain from the agreement,
and so the agreement is socially desirable. Yet even if this fails to happen—even if the
industry output is unchanged—licensing is still likely to be socially beneficial because the
licensing revenue at least increases producer surplus. Somebody then, either a producer or
a consumer or both, is made better off by licensing.

Moreover, licensing may have other beneficial effects. First, if a firm knows that it is
going to gain profits from licensing its research findings as well as (or instead of) exploiting
the research itself, this should increase the incentive to undertake research. Further, the
possibility that a firm can obtain a license to use a particular innovation reduces wasteful
R&D that either duplicates existing research efforts or is intended merely to invent around
an existing patent.

Consider an entrant whose profit (in present value terms) under duopoly is $5 million but
in order to enter has to incur an R&D expenditure of $3 million to develop its own product
alternative. In the absence of any licensing, the entrant will pursue this investment because
it yields a net gain of $2 million. Yet if this is the case, then the monopolist firm knows
that whether it licenses or not, it will soon be a duopolist. If the monopolist firm licenses its
technology to the entrant for $3 million, the entrant is just as well off and the monopolist
now gets the licensing revenue. In addition, society avoids the unnecessary expenditure of
$3 million that the entrant would otherwise have made. The moral of this section therefore
seems quite clear. Public policy should actively encourage the licensing of innovations as
much as possible.

There is, however, need for a cautionary note. Licensing might involve some risks. First,
consider the risks associated with licensing based upon an output-related royalty. Imagine
as well that the licensing agreement holds for the outstanding duration of the patent that is
being licensed because, after that, the information becomes publicly available. If the royalty
rate extracts almost all of the additional profits that the licensee might expect to make,
there is the risk that the licensee will take the license in order to gain experience with the
technology but then actually produce very little during the period of the license agreement,
which means, of course, that very little is actually paid for the license. Alternatively, if
output is difficult to monitor, the licensee has the incentive to lie about how much is actually
being produced. What may be necessary is that the licensor tie the license agreement to
some agreed minimum level of output on the part of the licensee, but even this is not always
easy to negotiate or enforce.

A further risk in licensing is that it can be difficult to write enforceable contracts that limit
the ways in which licensees can use the license. Typically, the licensor wants to limit the
markets into which the licensee can sell, for example, to avoid direct competition with the
licensor or with other licensees. This may be possible within a particular jurisdiction such
as the United States, although even here antitrust laws may prevent such market-limiting
agreements. But it is almost impossible to write binding contracts that limit the international
markets in which licensees can operate. In addition, access to a particular process or


Patents and Patent Policy 597


product technology may enhance the ability of a licensee to develop related technologies
that are not covered by the patent being licensed. Once again, it is almost impossible to
write enforceable contracts that protect the licensor from such imitation or at least give the
licensor some return from the new technologies that licensees develop.

Licensing raises public policy issues that suggest caution in favoring and promoting every
licensing agreement. One danger is that licensing contracts include restrictions on price
or geographic territory that create monopolies with exclusive territories—monopolies that
would otherwise be illegal under the antitrust laws. Matters become particularly complicated
when, as often happens, one patent leads to another, complementary development. One
firm creates, say, a new antibiotic that has some occasional and serious side effects. Then
another firm develops a means to undo the side effects of the first firm’s drug. The two
firms may strike a deal that licenses each to produce the other’s product. Yet it is easy to
see that this agreement may often include terms that exclude other firms. Such dangers are
recognized by US policy, which tends to limit severely the ability of reciprocal licensing
agreements to include exclusive provisions. Still, the example serves to make clear that the
tension between promoting licensing and realizing its associated benefits, on the one hand,
and the potential risk of collusion that licensing may foster, on the other, is real.


21.5.3 Patent Thickets and Sequential Innovation


Indeed, the increasing complexity of technical advances has resulted in what some call
a “patent thicket.” [See Shapiro (2000).] As advance builds on advance, and technical
progress increasingly draws from learning in different fields, the technology involved in
bringing a new product to market may be built upon a host of patented techniques, each of
which is owned by a different entity. The innovator may then need to get the approval of each
of the individual patent holders before proceeding. In turn, this can involve the coordination
difficulties of complements that we described in Chapters 8 and 16, among others.

To understand the patent thicket issue better consider a product that is produced
competitively but requires the input of three different patented inputs. That is, one unit of
each input is required to make the final product. While each input is freely available on
the market at cost _c,_ the patent owner establishes a patent fee per _fi_ unit of the associated
input, so that the final price for each input to the producers: _p_ 1 _f_ 1 _c_ _p_ 2 _f_ 2 _c_ and
_p_ 3 _f_ 3 _c_ . Demand for the final product is linear and given by = _P_ + A; =B _Q_ . Because + ;
the product is produced competitively, the final product price = + _P_ _p_ =1 _p_ −2 _p_ 3. We may
thus write the demand equation as: _p_ 1 _p_ 2 _p_ 3 A B _Q_ = + +

We imagine that each patent holder takes the price of its rivals as given. Because every + + =  unit of final product demand translates into exactly one unit of patented input demand for
each input we may write the inverse demand facing each patent holder as:



Patent Holder 1 : _p_ 1 A– _p_ 2– _p_ 3–B _Q_
=

Patent Holder 2 : _p_ 2 A– _p_ 1– _p_ 3–B _Q_
=



Patent Holder 3 : _p_ 3 A– _p_ 1– _p_ 2–B _Q_ (21.9)
=



It follows that the profit from patent license fees for each patent holder is:



_π_ 1 _f_ 1 _q_ 1 _f_ 1 _Q_ _(p_ 1– _c)Q_
= = =

_π_ 2 _f_ 2 _q_ 2 _f_ 2 _Q_ _(p_ 2– _c)Q_
= = =

_π_ 3 _f_ 3 _q_ 3 _f_ 3 _Q_ _(p_ 3– _c)Q_ (21.10)
= = =


598 Non-Price Competition


The usual profit-maximizing condition that marginal revenue equal marginal cost must
apply. So, we can write



MR1 A– _p_ 2– _p_ 3–2B _Q_ _c_
= =

MR2 A– _p_ 1– _p_ 3–2B _Q_ _c_
= =



MR3 A– _p_ 1– _p_ 3–2B _Q_ _c_ (21.11)
= =



If we sum up the three equations in (21.11), we then have:



3A–2 _p_ 1–2 _p_ 2–2 _p_ 3–6B _Q_ 3 _c_ ~~_c_~~ (21.12)
= =

where ~~_c_~~ is the actual unit cost of producing the product in the absence of any patent fees.
Given the inverse demand and the fact that competition implies 2 _(p_ 1 _p_ 2 _p_ 3 _)_ 2 _P,_
we may rewrite equation (21.12) as + + =

3 _P_ –2 _P_ –3B _Q_ = _P_ –3B _Q_ = ~~_c_~~ (21.13)

Hence, we have:



3 _[�P]_
= _�Q_








[3] (21.14)
= _ε_



_P_ ~~_c_~~
 - 3B

_P_ =




_Q_


_P_








_Q_


_P_



Equation (21.14) says that the industry price-cost margin as measured by the Lerner
Index introduced in Chapter 4 will be three times the inverse of the market elasticity of
demand _ε_ . Yet we know from that chapter as well as from our work in Chapter 16 that an
integrated firm that owned all three patents would set a price such that the Lerner Index
would be:



- ~~_c_~~ [1]

_P_ = _ε_



_P_ - ~~_c_~~



(21.15)
_ε_



In other words, with three independent patent owners each holding a critical patent, the
final markup is three times that which would maximize the industry’s joint profit. Of course,
this much higher price hurts consumers as well. Moreover, the result in equation (21.14)
readily generalizes. If _n_ firms each hold an essential patent, then the final price-cost margin
rises to _n/ε_ or _n_ times the optimal amount. Clearly, this patent thicket creates a major
obstacle to production.

There are a number of responses to the patent thicket. One is to permit the patent holders
to form a patent pool that permits others to acquire the use of all the patents for one overall
fee—in effect, producing the integrated solution. Another is to permit cross-licensing
agreements by which firms agree to license their patents to each other. However, these
all run the risk of permitting cooperation beyond the technological sphere and giving the
parties a chance to wield their technological power collectively against potential entrants.
Beyond these cooperative arrangements, though, another alternative is simply to recognize
that the intricate web of interconnected patents may be the result of policy that grants
patents too liberally. Hence, it may be that a weak patent policy in which patents are only
granted for the clearest and most dramatic of innovations is best. Such a weak patent policy
becomes even more attractive when patents are sequential so that each patent builds on an
earlier one as argued by Bessen and Maskin (2009). [10]


10 See Lerner and Tirole (2004).


Patents and Patent Policy 599


To get a sense of the Bessen and Maskin (2009) model, we consider the case of a
three-period duopoly under two regimes—one with clear and strongly enforced patents and
one with no patents in which case competitive imitation is quick to emerge. We will imagine
that a firm that does R&D in any period incurs a cost of _c_ and, with probability _p,_ creates an
innovation that raises the market value of a product by _V_ . This is true in each period. Thus,
if R&D is successful in period 1, it creates a total additional value of _V_ . A second innovation
in period 2 would then add a further _V_ in value _if combined with the product now enhanced_
_by the first innovation_ . Thus, the sequential nature of the innovative process is embodied in
the fact that no innovation can take place in period _t_ + 1 (or later period) _unless_ there is an
innovation in period _t,_ e.g., digital music players and “Bluetooth” digital music speakers
cannot be created unless someone first creates a process for digitalizing music.

To keep matters concrete, we will work with a numerical example in which _V_ is $200;
the probability of successful R&D by any one firm is _p_ = 0.5; and that the cost of R&D is
_c_ = $25. Thus, the net expected social value of one firm doing R&D is _pV_ - _c_ = $75.

To drive the point home as clearly as possible, we assume that under a patent regime the
first patent winner has to be paid for rights to use the enhanced product and all bargaining
power resides with this original innovator so that it can claim as payment the value of any
subsequent improvement. For example, suppose that firm 1 (alone) successfully innovates
in period 1. If firm 2 then makes a breakthrough in period 2 worth _V_ dollars, it would only
be able to apply this innovation to the product by also employing firm 1’s patent for which
it would have to pay a fee. Because firm 2 has already sunk the R&D cost of _c,_ there is
nothing to prevent firm 1 from setting a fee equal to the full value _V_ of the new innovation.
Yet that would mean that firm 2 would foresee that its risky research effort would ultimately
not be profitable and therefore not engage in research. The implication is that in our model,
a patent regime results in just one firm doing R&D once a breakthrough has been made. [11]

Now consider the first of our three periods and assume there is a breakthrough. If there is
a patent regime, then as just noted, the innovating firm will be the only firm that then does
R&D in either period 2 or period 3. What if there are no patents?

In the case of no patents, we assume that any innovation by one firm is followed
immediately by imitation by its rival leading to competition and that each firm receives the
payoff _SV,_ where _S <_ 0.5 to reflect the fact that competition results in some of the surplus
going not to the firms but to consumers. For our purposes, we will assume that _S_ = 0.4 _._

We start with the third and final period. At that time, each firm will have to decide
whether to incur a cost _c_ = $25 to engage in research with a potential social payoff of
_V_ = $200 and for which no prior inventor can claim any fee. However, if a breakthrough
is made by say firm 1, then the rival firm 2 imitates and competes with the result that the
revenue flow to both firms is _SV_ = $80. Because _pSV_ - _c_ = $15 _,_ we know that at least
one firm will find it profitable to pursue the innovation. Is there a possibility that both firms
will do so?

Recalling that if it fails, a second innovator can still copy rival success and letting either
firm’s R&D success be independent and equal to 0.5, the answer is no. If a second firm
spends $25 on R&D, it will be successful half the time and earn $80. It will fail the other
half but in half of these cases it can copy its successful rival. So the expected net gain of a
second firm’s R&D expense is:

[ _p_ + _p_ [2] ] _SV_  - _c_ = 0.75 × 0.4 × $200 − $25 = $35 (21.16)

11 More generally, firm 1 will only permit firm 2 to use its patent if the joint profit of both firms with both
patents in use exceeds firm 1’s monopoly profit and there is no reason to assume that this is the case.


600 Non-Price Competition


However, with no patents, instead of spending on R&D like its rival, a firm can choose not
to do so and simply imitate any successful innovation that the rival develops. In this case,
the imitating firm has expected profit

_pSV_ = 0.5 × 0.4 × $200 = $40 (21.17)

As the payoff is greater to imitating rather than being a second innovator, the period 3
outcome in the no-patent regime must be one in which one firm does R&D and the other
does not. There are of course two such equilibria—one in which firm 1 does the R&D and
one in which firm 2 does the R&D. We will imagine that this choice is made by random
assignment, i.e., a coin toss.

Now consider period 2. In that period, we know that at least one firm will innovate because
again, _pSV_ - _c_ = $15. In considering whether a second firm will innovate or simply imitate
though, the calculation now is a little changed. This is because a breakthrough in the second
period helps _both_ firms in the third period because that is what makes possible an innovation
at that later time. Suppose for example that firm 1 pursues R&D in period 2, but firm 2 does
not. Then firm 2’s expected profit over both periods 2 and 3 is:


E _(π_ 2 _)_ 0.5 0.4 $200 0.5 0.5[ _(_ 0.5 0.4 $200 $25 _)_ _(_ 0.5 $0.4 $200 _)_ ]
= × × + × × ×   - + × ×

= $53.75 (21.18)


Firm 2’s expected profit if it imitates in period 2 has two parts. The first is the probability
that firm 1 makes a breakthrough in period 2, which happens with probability 0.5 and in
which case firm 2 imitates and earns $80. The second term is firm 2’s expected third-period
gain. Getting to that period with any opportunity for further innovation is simply the
probability _p_ = 0.5 that firm 1 is successful in period 2. In that third period however, we
know that only one firm pursues R&D. Given that the chances of success are _p_ = 0.5 _,_
that firm has expected profit of 0.5 × 0.4 × $200 − $25 _,_ and its rival has expected profit
0.5 × 0.4 × $200. Of course, firm 2 has a fifty percent chance of being either one of these
firms in period 3.

If on the other hand, firm 2 decides to follow firm 1 and pursue R&D in period 2, its
expected profit over the remaining two periods is:


E _(π_ 2 _)_ 0.75 0.4 $200 $25 0.75 0.5[ _(_ 0.5 0.4 $200 $25 _)_ _(_ 0.5 $0.4 $200 _)_ ]
= × ×   - + × × ×   - + × ×

= $55.625 (21.19)

Here again, firm 2’s expected profit has two components. The first is the now higher
probability that there is a breakthrough in period 2 times the revenue that brings and less
the cost of doing research _plus_ the also higher probability that there is opportunity for a
further breakthrough in period 3 times the expected net gain for firm 2 in that period which
depends on whether it is the one firm then doing any R&D.

As can be seen, firm 2 does better by investing in research in period 2 and thereby
adding its innovative efforts to those of firm 1 rather than simply imitating its rival. Thus,
conditional on a breakthrough in period 1, the no-patent regime leads to both firms doing
research in period 2 and only one doing it in period 3 while the patent regime leads to
only one firm doing research in both periods 2 and 3, i.e., the no-patent regime yields more
R&D following the initial period than the patent regime does. Moreover, this result easily
generalizes to periods 2 and 3 in a four-period model; periods 2, 3, and 4 in a five-period


Patents and Patent Policy 601


model; and so on. The intuition is straightforward. By adding to the innovation effort of its
rival, firm 2 not only increases the chance of an innovation in that period but also to the
chance of an innovation later which helps firm 2 even if it plans only to imitate at those
later times. This makes doing R&D more profitable.

We have not addressed the first period. It is easy to guess though that a strong patent
system will generate as much if not more R&D effort as a weak one in that first interval.
However, the sequential nature of innovation suggests that once an innovation occurs, the
obstacles that a strong patent system and associated patent thicket creates may well lead
to _less_ innovative activity in every subsequent period. This conclusion follows directly
from the sequential nature of innovation. Hence, to the extent that innovation has that
sequential feature, there is again concern that recent patent policy has erred too strongly in
the protection of intellectual property.

21.6 RECENT PATENT POLICY DEVELOPMENTS


In the first half of the l980s, a number of events occurred that, together, greatly increased the
legal protection of patent rights in the United States. The first and perhaps most crucial step
was a legal reorganization that gave the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC),
in Washington, D.C., exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals in an effort to unify the
legal treatment of patent rights. This court is widely considered to have a very “pro-patent”
view and, until recently, its decisions were left unquestioned by the US Supreme Court.
The CAFC emerged as the final and sole arbiter of patent disputes and its pro-patent views
became widely reflected in lower court cases. Just how much stronger patent protection was
to become became apparent in the 1986 patent infringement suit filed by Polaroid against
Kodak regarding Kodak’s production and sale of an instant-film and instant-picture camera.

Prior to that decision, losers in a patent infringement case had typically paid small
penalties and been permitted to continue to produce so long as they paid appropriate
royalties to the winner. However, when Polaroid won the suit Kodak was required to pay
very large penalties and, most importantly, forced to stop producing its instant camera.
Because shutting down a high volume production line is very expensive—even if only

for a few weeks—the fact that the courts were now willing to impose such an outcome
put all firms on notice that patent infringement cases were serious business. Moreover, the
Kodak/Polaroid case was quickly followed by very aggressive behavior on the part of one
firm, Texas Instruments (TI), in filing infringement suits (mostly against foreign firms) and
raising royalty fees that also served to put high technology firms on notice. In the technology
sector, where reverse engineering has always been important, TI was so aggressive that
its royalty fees and court awards began to outstrip its production activities as a source of
revenue.

In short, a new legal environment of much stronger protection for patent-holder rights
emerged in the United States in the 1980s. It may not be surprising then to discover that
there was an explosion of patent activity over the next several years. Between 1983 and
2000, the annual number of patent applications doubled while the annual number of patents
actually granted rose by an even greater 170 percent.


Patents and Patent Policy 603


There has been increasing concern that the strengthened protection of patent rights has
become too aggressive. To begin with, recent empirical evidence casts considerable doubt
that stronger patent enforcement yields better innovation results. Drawing on a range of
sources, Lerner (2000) identified 177 distinct patent policy changes in 60 countries over 150
years such as those that lengthened or broadened patents, those that reduced the patent filing
fee, those that required compulsory licensing, and so forth. He then examined the effect of
these changes on the rate of patenting. He found that increased patent protection sharply
increased patenting by foreign firms but decreased patenting by domestic innovators. The
overall effect was positive. However, the inference is that foreign companies used patents to
protect themselves against domestic competitors. Hence, while patents may have enhanced
international trade, their effect on innovation was negligible.

Moser (2005) constructed internationally comparable data using the catalogues of two
19 [th] century world fairs: the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London, 1851, and the Centennial
Exhibition in Philadelphia, 1876. These included innovations that were not patented, as
well as those that were, and innovations from countries both with and without patent laws.
He found no evidence that patent laws increased levels of innovative activity. Instead,
they simply affected the direction of innovation. Relative to countries with strong patent
protection, inventors in countries without such protection simply concentrated their efforts
in industries where secrecy was easily maintained, leaving the overall rate of innovative
efforts unchanged. Similarly, Sakakibara and Branstetter (2001) found no evidence that
a strengthening of Japanese patent laws in 1988 led to any increased R&D spending or
innovative output.

Fears that patent protection had gone too far reached a dramatic high point in February
2007 when the three million customers of the BlackBerry wireless e-mail service were
threatened with a shutdown due to a patent dispute. A small Virginia firm, NTP, had
developed and patented the technology for a wireless e-mail device in 1990. However, NTP
never produced a product nor did it make any effort to license the technology to others. In
1998, the Canadian firm, Research In Motion (RIM), unveiled its first wireless e-mail device.
Sales took off sharply. Although RIM claimed that it had developed the technology on its
own, NTP filed suit against BlackBerry in 2001. In 2002, a US jury found the Canadian firm
guilty of sixteen counts of patent infringement. On appeal, seven of these were dismissed
in 2004 but that still left nine outstanding. In 2005, RIM offered a $450 million to NTP
to settle the case, but that settlement was rejected by the trial judge. In January 2006, the
Supreme Court refused to hear any further appeal and a hearing to order a shutdown of the
BlackBerry service was scheduled for Friday, February 24, 2006. The hearing did not reach
a final decision. However, after further negotiations, RIM and NTP reached a settlement in
which RIM made a one-time payment of $615 million to the Virginian firm for unfettered
use of the technology. The agreement came even as the US Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO) was conducting a review of the legitimacy of NTP’s patents. Many felt that the
strong pro-patent laws had effectively allowed NTP to extort the payment from RIM and
forced it to rush to a settlement before the USPTO completed its review.

In April of 2007, the Supreme Court served notice that it too was concerned about
excessive patent protection. (See Reality Checkpoint.) In _KSR International vs.Teleflex, Inc_
the court ruled that new products that combine elements of pre-existing inventions and that
result from nothing more than “ordinary innovation” with no more than predictable results
were not entitled to patent protection. The decision was notable both for its unanimity and
for its clear concern that patent system abuse could undermine innovation. As a result, most
experts believe that the decision raised the bar substantially for future patent applications.
It also opened the door to a re-examination of existing patents and gave judges much more

leeway to dismiss patent infringement suits. Further evidence that the Court had moved to
a less protective patent policy came in June, 2013 when it rules that firms could not legally
patent human genes.


21.7 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: PATENT LAW AND PATENT
PRACTICE IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY


The semiconductor industry was not immune to the patent fever that spread through America
in the last part of the 20 [th] century. As Hall and Ziedonis (2001) document, patent awards per
million dollars of R&D spending in this industry doubled in the ten years following 1982.


Patents and Patent Policy 605


What makes this increase particularly striking is that semiconductor industry representatives
have been surveyed repeatedly and consistently reported that patents are not a very effective
way to appropriate the returns on R&D investments. Because the semiconductor industry is
one of rapid technological change where product life cycles are short, semiconductor firms
have instead relied on lead time, secrecy, and product design tactics to reap the profits from
their innovations. What then is the reason for the increased patent activity by semiconductor
firms? How is it related to the changed legal environment?

Hall and Ziedonis (2001) examine the patent explosion in the semiconductor industry
using data from 95 industry firms covering the years 1979 to 1995. These firms were
awarded over 17,000 patents in this period. Hall and Ziedonis (2001) model these successful
patents as the outcome of a patent production process that relates the _i_ th firm’s production
of patents in year _t_ or _pit_ to a set of variables _Xit_ including the firm’s R&D spending and its
overall size. However, they recognize that _pit_ is what is called a count variable. That is, it
counts the number of successes that take place during a time interval of given length. Thus,
_pit_ can only take discrete integer values and often will be zero. If we consider _pit_ to have
a random component, then we need to assume a probability distribution that recognizes
these features. The natural choice for this purpose is the Poisson distribution, which gives
the probability f _(λ, p)_ that there are _p_ occurrences of a random variable in a fixed time
interval as:


_f (λ, p)_ _[e]_ [−] _[λ][λ][p]_ (21.20)
= _p_ !


The Poisson distribution has a very nice feature in that it is fully characterized by the
parameter _λ,_ which is both its mean and its variance. Thus, Hall and Ziedonis (2001) model
patent production as a Poisson process that has a conditional mean _λit_ that is an exponential
function of _Xit_ as follows:


_E(pit_ _Xit)_ _λit_ exp _(Xitβ_ _γt_ _)_ (21.21)
| = = +

where _γt_ is a 1,0 dummy variable for each year reflecting factors in that year that are
common to the patenting activity of all semiconductor firms. Of course, we can linearize
this relationship by taking logs to yield:


ln _λit_ _Xitβ_ _γt_ (21.22)
= +

Hall and Ziedonis (2001) measure _pit_ as the number of patents per employee. The
variables in _Xit_ include: 1) the log of firm R&D spending per employee; 2) a 1,0 dummy
variable equal to one if the firm reported no R&D spending that year and zero otherwise;
3) the log of firm size measured as the number of employees in thousands; 4) the log of the
plant and equipment value per employee as a measure of the capital intensity of the firm’s
production; 5) a 1,0 dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm entered the market after 1982
and zero otherwise; 6) a 1,0 dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm is a design firm that does
no fabrication and zero if it is a manufacturing firm; 7) a 1,0 dummy variable equal to 1 if
the firm is Texas Instruments and zero otherwise; and 8) the log of the firm’s age.

The first three variables reflect the standard view of patents as the output of a process in
which R&D is the input and in which there may be scale economies. The fourth variable
allows Hall and Ziedonis (2001) to test the hypothesis that part of the increased patenting


606 Non-Price Competition


following the change in the patent enforcement environment reflects the decision by firms
with large sunk costs who cannot afford to get “held up” in a patent dispute, to expand
their patent portfolio rapidly to guard against such “hold ups.” The fifth and sixth variables
allow them to test a second hypothesis, namely, that another reason for the rise in patent
activity was that the new legal environment made it attractive for design firms who, unlike
semiconductor manufacturers, rely heavily on patents to enter the market, and thereby they
change the mix of firms in the semiconductor industry to one more likely to patent. The
seventh variable captures the well-known super-aggressive patenting strategy adopted by
TI, while the age variable allows for firm-specific learning.

Hall and Ziedonis (2001) observe the annual number of patents _pit_ by firm _i_ in year
_t_ for 95 semiconductor firms from 1979 to 1995, and use these to estimate a Poisson
process in which the mean _λ_ is taken to be conditional on a set of firm characteristics _Xit_
and time dummies _γit_ . Because they are estimating a Poisson distribution, the assumptions
of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) do not hold. Instead, Hall and Ziedonis use Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Because _λ_ is both the mean and the variance of the Poisson
distribution, comparing the variance of the data with the mean is a natural test for the
appropriateness of the underlying Poisson specification. The results of their two regressions
that do best on this test are shown in Table 21.3, below.

The estimates in both regressions for the first four variables imply roughly constant
returns to scale in patent production. As firm size (measured by the number of employees)
grows, semiconductor firms tend to increase their patent output proportionately. This is
similar to the finding of other researchers, e.g., Hall, Griliches, and Hausmann (1986). It is
also clear that TI has a markedly higher propensity to patent than do other semiconductor
firms consistent with TI’s well-known aggressive patenting policy during these years.

Most importantly, both of the key hypotheses are supported by these data. Firms
with capital-intensive production as measured by the amount of plant and equipment per
employee do significantly more patenting than others do. In addition, it appears that the
firms that entered the industry following the 1982 centralization of patent law cases at the
CAFC were much more likely to patent than the firms that were already in the industry. The
coefficient on the post-1982 entry variable is highly significant in both regressions. While
the coefficient on the design firm variable is not significant in the second regression, it is
if the post-1982 entry variable is omitted indicating that the entry variable reflects mostly
entry by design firms.

**Figure 21.3** Pattern of regression time coefficients in semiconductor patent behavior


In sum, Hall and Ziedonis (2001) interpret their results as indicating two major reasons
for the jump in patenting efforts in the semiconductor industry after 1983. One is that the
new pro-patent environment and the prospect of having production actually stopped by legal
injunction was particularly threatening to capital-intensive firms with heavy sunk costs. The
result was that they responded strategically by rapidly accumulating a portfolio of patents
to protect their products and processes. The second was that the changed legal environment
also induced entry of purely design firms that have an inherently greater propensity to patent
their findings in any case.

There is also a third effect revealed by the Hall and Ziedonis (2001) findings. This is that
the changed legal framework led all semiconductor firms to patent more. The evidence for
this is in the time dummies (not shown). Normalizing so that the effect is zero in 1979, the
pattern of these coefficients is shown in Figure 21.3. Here, the dotted line reflects the time
dummy coefficients from the first of the two regressions above, while the dashed line reflect
the same coefficients in the second regression estimates.

What both sets of estimates clearly show is that after 1986, even after controlling for
the mix of semiconductor firm characteristics, there was a steady increase in the proclivity
to patent with each successive year. The new pro-patent environment is the most obvious
explanation for this rise that is common to all semiconductor firms.


**Summary**



By giving innovators a legally enforceable means
of earning a return on their discoveries, patents
and copyrights do provide incentives for innovative activity that might otherwise not be
undertaken. Yet patents also confer monopoly
power on the patent holder, with all the price
distortions that such power entails. In addition,
patent rules may enhance the ability of existing
monopolies to maintain their current dominant
position against would-be entrants. One mechanism by which this may occur is through the
use of “sleeping patents” designed to buffer
the invention against any and all attacks from



rival innovations that might permit an entrant to
“invent around” the original patent.

Licensing agreements by which firms permit
the use of their patented knowledge for a fee
can help ameliorate the patent tension. This is
because such agreements both permit wider use
of the innovation and also allow an innovator to
earn a greater return on its R&D investments than
it otherwise would receive. However, licensing
contracts can be difficult to enforce except by
imposing restrictions that can be harmful to
competition.


608 Non-Price Competition


Within the United States, the 1980s marked a
sharp increase in the legal protection of patents
against infringement. This was followed by an
equally sharp increase in both patent applications and patent grants. Empirical evidence from
the semiconductor industry suggests that this
reflects in part the desire of firms with large sunk
investments in products and processes to avoid
disruption of their production by accumulating a
large patent portfolio. It also reflects the encouragement of entry by new firms that rely more
heavily on patents to appropriate the gains of
their innovations. That evidence also confirms
that there was a general rise in patent proclivity
across all semiconductor firms at that time.


**Problems**


1. Let the inverse demand for a particular
product be given by _P_ = 250 − _Q_ . The
product is offered by two Cournot firms,
each of which has a current marginal cost
of $100. Both firms can invest a sum _K_
to establish a research facility to develop
a new process with lower marginal costs.
The probability of success is _ρ._
a. Assume that the new process is
expected to have marginal costs of $70.
Derive a relationship between _K_ and _ρ_
under which

i. neither firm establishes the
research facility;
ii. only one firm establishes a
research facility;
iii. both firms establish a research
facility.
b. Can there be “too much” R&D? Illustrate your answers in a diagram with _ρ_
on one axis and _K_ on the other.
c. Now assume that the marginal costs of
the new process are expected to be $40.
How does this affect your answers to
1(a)?


2. In the text of this chapter we considered
sleeping patents in the context of a process
innovation. The same principles apply in the
case of a product innovation. To see why,
consider the following example: Assume
that there are 100 aspiring Olympic swimmers whose tastes for low-water-resistance



More recently, there has been concern that
US patent protection has been overly strong,
especially because there is little evidence that it
has led to faster innovation. In particular, patent
decisions may have created a thicket of necessary approvals and fees that strongly deters new
product development. This is particularly true if
patents have a sequential feature such that one
patent builds on those before it. Accordingly,
recent court decisions have pared back these protections. However, as our discussion of licensing
and recent legal developments makes clear, there
is no easy way to eliminate the tension between
allocative and innovative activity that a patent
system is meant to balance.


colored swimming suits are evenly distributed over the color spectrum from black
to yellow. The “length” of this spectrum is
normalized to be one unit. Each of these
swimmers values the loss of utility from
being offered swimming suits in other than
their favorite color at $10 per unit of “distance.” Each swimmer will buy exactly one
swimming suit per period provided that the
full price for the suit—the price charged by
the firm plus the value of utility loss if there
is a color difference between the suits on
offer and the swimmer’s favorite color—is
less than $100 (these are very keen swimmers!). Production of low-water-resistance
swimming suits is currently feasible only in
black and is controlled by a monopolist who
has a patent on the production of the black
material. The marginal cost of making a
swimming suit is $25 _._
a. What is the current profit-maximizing
price per suit and what are the monopolist’s per-period profits?

Now assume that research can be
conducted that will allow the swimming suits also to be manufactured
in yellow at the same marginal cost
of $25 _._
b. If the monopolist undertakes the
research and introduces the new color
what will be the resulting equilibrium
prices of black and yellow swimming suits? What is the impact on the


monopolist’s per-period profit, ignoring research costs?
c. If a new entrant undertakes the research
and introduces the new color, what
will be the resulting equilibrium prices
of black and yellow swimming suits?
What will the entrant’s per-period
profit be, again ignoring research costs?


3. Return to Problem 2, above.
a. Confirm that the incumbent monopolist will be willing to spend more
on researching the new color than the
potential entrant.
b. Assume that the research costs can be
split into some amount _R,_ which is pure
research cost, and another amount _D,_
which is development cost—the cost
of transforming a successful innovation
into a viable product. Calculate limits
on _R_ and _D_ such that the monopolist
will be willing to undertake the research
into manufacture of yellow swimming
suits and patent it but then leave the
patent sleeping.


4. Consider a Cournot duopoly in which
inverse demand is given by _P_ = 120 − _Q_ .
Marginal cost of each firm is currently $60 _._
a. What is the Cournot equilibrium quantity for each firm, product price, and
profit of each firm?

Now assume that one of the firms
develops a new technology that reduces
marginal cost to $30 _._

Here, we derive the optimal license fee for the simple case in the text. Demand is
_P_ = _A_ - _BQ,_ the initial marginal cost is _c_ ’ and the innovation lowers marginal costs to _c_ .
For any royalty per unit _r_ ≤ _c_ ’− _c_ . the innovator’s profit is:



_π_ _[(A]_ [ −] _[Nc]_ [ +] _[ (N]_ [ −] [1] _[)(c]_ [ +] _[ r))]_ [2]
= _B(N_ 1 _)_ [2]



(21.A1)
_B(N_ + 1 _)_




[ +] _[ (N]_ [ −] [1] _[)(c]_ [ +] _[ r))]_ [2]

_r(N_ 1 _)_ _[(A]_ [ −] _[Nc]_ [ +] _[ (N]_ [ −] [1] _[)(c]_ [ +] _[ r))]_
_B(N_ 1 _)_ [2] + + _B(N_ 1 _)_
+ +



Since _(A_  - _Nc_ + _(N_ –1 _)(c_ + _r))_ = _A_  - _c_ + _(N_ –1 _)r,_ it is evident that the expression in
(21.A1) is increasing in _r_ . Hence, profit maximization implies raising _r_ as high as possible
until the maximum _c’_ - _c_ is reached.


## **Part Seven**
# **Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Policy** **Commitment**

In this final part of the text, we explore topics that do not fit easily within our earlier
classifications. The first of these is network externalities, which are the topic of Chapter 22.
For many goods, such as telephones, the value of the product to any one consumer rises as
additional consumers buy it. Such network effects greatly alter both the nature of industry
competition and the characteristics of the market outcome. Often, network externalities and
the complementarities that underlie them give rise to multiple equilibria with no guarantee
that the actual equilibrium chosen will be the best of these. Further, because network
externalities act much like scale economies except that they work on the demand side, they
create strong incentives for firms to operate on a large scale with the result that the market
will inevitably be dominated by those few firms that survive. In turn, because not just some
profit but a firm’s very survival may be at stake, competition in industries with important
network effects can be incredibly fierce. We explore these issues in some detail. We also
include a discussion of Gandal’s (1994) empirical study that tries to identify network
characteristics in the market for computer spreadsheets.

In Chapter 23, we switch gears somewhat and turn to the topic of auctions. It has only
been in recent years that auctions have re-emerged as a common market arrangement,
especially for government privatization efforts and private exchanges on the Internet. Our
analysis begins with a review of Vickery’s (1961) classic piece leading to the Revenue
Equivalence Theorem, which says that, under certain rather broad conditions, the final
auction price is independent of the auction design. We then examine various ways in which
this outcome might break down when bidders have affiliated values or signals. Perhaps
most importantly, we show that the insights of auction theory may be usefully applied to
industrial organization topics such as Bertrand pricing. We subsequently offer the Porter
and Zona (1999) study of Ohio school milk auctions as an example of careful application
of auction models to uncovering collusive behavior.

Finally, Chapter 24 applies the insights of industrial organization to international trade.
We explore how knowledge of the Cournot and Bertrand models can help to develop strategic
trade policies that depart from the economist’s traditional free trade recommendations. This
analysis allows us to make clear the critical role of commitment in any strategic setting. We
conclude with an investigation of the use of strategic trade policy by the Canadian Wheat
Board along the lines of a Cournot model as suggested by Hamilton and Stiegert (2002).


### **22** **Network Issues**

On Thursday, November 15, 2001, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates introduced the video game
console, _Xbox_ . Many questioned the decision to launch this new entry in a market that was
then dominated by Sony and Nintendo, and that also included Sega, another firm with a
sizable installed base. Today, however, the _Xbox_ brand is still very much alive. The _Xbox_
_360_ (introduced in 2005) is the best-selling video game console in the world and claims a 47
percent share of the North American market—well above rivals Sony ( _PS3_ ) and Nintendo
( _Wii_ ). Sega has exited the market altogether. All of the current ten best-selling games from
_Mass Effect_ to _Kingdoms of Amalur_ to _Just Dance_ are available in _Xbox_ format. In 2011,
_Xbox_ consoles sales totaled $2.1 billion alone, and Microsoft earned an additional $4.6
billion from sales of games and accessories. Current estimates imply that 67 million _Xboxes_
have been sold since that November 2001 launch.

The _Xbox_, of course, is just one of many computer-based success stories associated with
Microsoft. Unlike most of these, however, the _Xbox_ is a hardware product. Rather than
Microsoft, the major providers of the software that runs on the _Xbox_ platform are game
development firms such as Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Indeed, both the game
developers and Microsoft are tied in a sort of “chicken-and-egg” relationship. There is no
way to market _Xboxes_ successfully unless developers produce games for that console. Yet
there is no reason for developers to produce games for the _Xbox_ unless a lot of _Xboxes_ are
sold. Put differently, the more _Xboxes_ are sold, the more game-makers want to develop _Xbox_
compatible games, and the more _Xbox_ compatible games there are the more consumers
want to buy the _Xbox_ . There is then an external effect to the consumers’ decision. As more
consumers buy the _Xbox_, more games are developed for that platform, raising the value of
the _Xbox_ for everyone.

When the value of a product to any one consumer increases as the number of other
consumers using the product increases, we say that the market for that product exhibits
network externalities or demand-side scale economies. Video game consoles exhibit such
network effects but they are far from the only such goods and services. Telephone systems
are perhaps the most obvious of the other examples. By itself, one person’s ownership of a
telephone is not very valuable. Yet as more and more phone users hook into the system, the
value of a connected phone rises for all. The online auction firm eBay offers yet another
illustration of network effects. Prior to the 1990s, direct trade in many items, especially
collectibles, had been limited because of the extreme cost of matching a potential buyer


Network Issues 613


with a potential seller. eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar, was among the first to recognize the
enormous potential of the Internet—which makes it easy to disseminate a vast amount of
information to a large number of buyers and sellers in a very short time—to solve this
problem. As more buyers came to look for goods on eBay, more sellers found it worthwhile
to sell there which, in turn, attracted more buyers and so on.

The telephone and eBay cases are examples of what are typically called _direct_ network
effects. In contrast, the video game console market illustrates an _indirect_ network effect.
Operating systems such as _Windows_ and _Mac_ also benefit from indirect network externalities.
Analogous to the console, these systems become more popular as more software is developed
to run on them while, in turn, more compatible software is developed as the systems become
more popular. The difference between direct and indirect network effects should thus be
clear. In the direct case, the effects pertain directly to the good or service, e.g., the telephone,
itself. In indirect case, the network effect is mediated by a complementary good. In this
chapter, we investigate these issues and the equilbria that are likely when important network
effects are present. [1]


22.1 MONOPOLY PROVISION OF A NETWORK SERVICE


An early but insightful analysis of network issues is that provided by Rohlfs (1974). Rohlfs’
approach is quite straightforward and draws attention to the main issues that arise in network
settings. It simplifies the supply side by assuming a monopoly so that the analysis can focus
on the central demand-side aspects that give rise to network effects. We present a modified
version of Rohlfs model here.

Assume that the monopolist, say a telecommunications firm, charges an access fee but
does not impose a per usage charge. That is, the consumer is charged a single price _p_ for
“hooking up” to the network but each individual call is free, perhaps because the marginal
cost of a call is zero. [2] We will also assume that there is a maximum size of the market, say
one million, reflecting the maximum number _N_ of consumers who would ever willingly
buy the product even if the access fee were zero. By fixing the total amount of potential
customers at _N_, we can talk interchangeably about the fraction _f_ of the market and the
actual number of customers _fN_ served. That is, if the maximum size of the market is one
million, we can characterize a market outcome in which 100,000 purchase the service either
in terms of the fraction _f_ = 0.10 or the number of customers _fN_ = 100,000 served.

Consumers all agree that the service is more valuable the greater the fraction _f_ of
the market that signs up for it. However, even if everyone acquires the service _(f_ = 1 _)_,
consumers would still vary in their valuation or willingness to pay for the service.
Specifically, we denote the valuation of the _i_ th consumer when _f_ 1, as _vi_ . These
=
valuations or _vis_ are assumed to be uniformly distributed between 0 and $100. For example,
the 1 percent of consumers who most value the service (roughly about 10,000 individuals
in our case) would willingly pay close to $100 for it if they knew that all other consumers
would also acquire it. Unfortunately, when the consumer signs on, the consumer does not
know the actual fraction _f_ of potential users that will sign on to the network. Instead, the
consumer’s willingness to pay depends on the fraction _f_ _[e]_ of users the consumer _expects_ to
sign on in that the _ith_ consumer’s willingness to pay for network membership is assumed
