other respects, however, the _Magicam_ is essentially identical to a typical real-world camera.
In particular, both a _Magicam_ and a regular camera can be used to make anywhere from
one to a very large number of pictures per day or per month. It is up to the owner to decide
how many pictures to take per period of time.

This fact does not mean that every consumer who has a _Magicam_ will take a huge number
of snapshots. After all, they have to pay for the film cartridge and spend time taking pictures
rather than doing other things. Presumably, consumers differ in this regard. Suppose that
there are one thousand low-demand consumers each with a monthly demand for pictures
described by _Q_ = 12 − _P,_ and one thousand high-demand consumers each with a monthly
demand for pictures given by _Q_ = 16 − _P_ . In other words, if cartridges of film were free,
the first group of consumers would each take twelve pictures per month and the second
group sixteen pictures. Unfortunately, Rowling Corp. has no way, magical or otherwise, of
identifying these different types.

Because of the sensitive nature of the technology incorporated in _Magicams_ we assume
that Rowling Corp. does not sell the cameras but rather uses its monopoly power to offer
them on monthly lease agreements that include servicing the camera to maintain its magical
properties. [6] Given that the lease fee is set such that each of the two thousand consumers
will lease a _Magicam_ the manufacturing costs of the cameras become effectively fixed costs
for Rowling Corp. The same is not true for the camera film. Suppose that film production
takes place under competitive conditions and that the marginal cost of producing film is $2
per photograph that the film can take. This means, of course, that film will be priced at the
competitive price of $2 per picture. Now consider Rowling Corp.’s potential strategies for
leasing its cameras.

If a _Magicam_ and camera film are all that is needed for producing the wonderful pictures,
Rowling Corp. might find the situation somewhat frustrating. Because the firm cannot tell
one type of consumer from another, the firm cannot easily lease its _Magicams_ at different
prices to each type. About the best that Rowling Corp. can do is to charge a monthly lease
rate of $50. Why? Because this is the consumer surplus earned by a low-demand consumer
faced with a film price of $2 per picture and Rowling Corp. cannot price discriminate across
the two consumer types. (You should check that this is indeed the consumer surplus for a
low-demand consumer when film is priced at $2 per picture.)

Both types of consumer will lease the camera. High-demand consumers will use it to
take fourteen pictures per month while low-demand consumers will take ten pictures per
month. Rowling earns a monthly profit of $50 on each of the 2,000 cameras leased—1,000
to the low-demand and 1,000 to the high-demand types—or $100,000 per month.

The situation is not desperate, but like any good profit-maximizer, Rowling wonders if
somehow the firm can do better. After thinking a bit, Rowling management realizes that
with some redesigning of the camera and a bit of clever marketing it can tie the lease of a
_Magicam_ to the use of its own _Magifilm_ . This gives Rowling an idea. Why not implement
a tying strategy and sell _Magifilm_ cartridges at $4 per exposure?

Both low- and high-demand consumers now pay $4 at the margin for a picture. The
low-demand consumers will therefore reduce their monthly demand for _Magicam_ photos
to just eight. And if low-demand consumers pay the $4 per picture price of _Magifilm_, they
will enjoy a surplus of $32. Thus this surplus is the rental rate at which Rowling can lease
the _Magicam_ . (Notice the connection between this and our discussion of two-part pricing in


6 This is actually the strategy that IBM, Kodak. and Xerox used initially with their machines.


190 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Chapter 6.) As a result, Rowling earns $32 from each of the 1,000 low-demand consumers
in camera rentals and $16 from each in cartridge sales, giving a total profit of $48,000 from
the low-demand customers.

High-demand consumers will also lease the _Magicam_ at $32. However, at $4 per picture
in film costs, these consumers will shoot twelve photos per month. Hence, Rowling earns
a profit of $32 on cameras and $24 on film cartridges from each of the 1,000 high-demand
customers, giving a total profit from this group of $56,000. In total, Rowling now earns a
combined profit of $104,000 —greater than the $100,000 it earned without the tie-in. It has
achieved this profit increase by exploiting its ability to _tie_ the use of its camera to the use
of its film.

To understand the way that tying helps Rowling, first note that high demand consumers
receive a quantity discount under either of the two regimes. When the _Magicam_ is leased
for $50 and the film is purchased competitively at $2 per photo, high-demand consumers
take fourteen photos and pay only $5.57 per shot, while low-demand consumers take ten
pictures and pay $7 for each. Under the tied film arrangement, high-demand consumers
pay a total charge of $80 for twelve pictures, or $6.67 per photo. By contrast, low-demand
consumers pay a total of $64 and take only eight pictures per month, or $8 per photo. Thus,
the tied sale is not attractive solely because it permits a quantity discount.

What tying does accomplish is to permit Rowling to solve the identification and arbitrage
problems by exploiting its post-lease position as the monopoly seller of _Magifilm_ . Now, the
high-demand consumers are revealed by their film purchases to Rowling and the quantity
discount is put to work in a profit-increasing way. Nor is arbitrage capable of undoing the
discrimination. After all, both the camera and the film are readily available to all consumers
at the same prices. Given that a single _Magicam_ can serve either a low-demand consumer or
a high-demand consumer equally well, solving the identification and arbitrage problems can
only be achieved by tying its use to another product whose volume does change depending
on the consumer’s type. No consumer will ever lease more than one _Magicam_, but they will
differ in terms of how much _Magifilm_ they purchase.

Now let’s take Rowling’s case one step further. The low- and high-demand functions we
have used may look familiar to you. They are the same ones we used in Chapter 6 in our
discussion of quantity discounts with second-degree price discrimination. If you look back
at that earlier example, you may get an idea of how Rowling can redesign and package the
camera to do even better. For example, suppose that Rowling redesigns the _Magicam_ so
that the cartridge of _Magifilm_ becomes an integral part of the camera that only Rowling’s
film developers can take out without destroying the camera.

Rowling can then design two varieties of its new, integrated _Magicam_, one of which has
a ten-shot capacity and the other a fourteen-shot capacity. [7] The firm can offer to lease the
ten-shot _Magicam_ for $70 per month and the fourteen-shot _Magicam_ for $88 per month. In
both cases, the lease agreement also offers free developing as well as the free replacement
of the cartridge. From our analysis in Chapter 6, we know what will happen in this case.
Low-demand consumers will lease the ten-shot _Magicam_ while high-demand consumers
will lease the fourteen-shot _Magicam_ . Rowling will then earn an even greater profit of
$50,000 + $58,000 = $108,000. This technological integration plus the monthly leasing
agreement has enabled Rowling to identify and separate the different customers even more
profitably.


7 With marginal film costs of $2 _,_ these are the socially efficient quantities to offer.


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 191


low-demand consumers and let them have inverse demand functions of _P_ = 16 − _Q_ and
_P_ = 12 − _Q_ _**,**_ respectively. Show that the price of $ **4** per photo is, indeed, the profitmaximizing price for _Magifilm_ when the film is sold separately from the camera. Now
suppose that Rowling Corp. produces the integrated camera plus film cartridge in eight-shot
and fourteen-shot varieties. What rental rates will be charged for the two varieties? What
are Rowling Corp.’s profits? Finally, suppose that there are 1,000 low-demand consumers
and _Nh_ high-demand consumers. How many high-demand consumers would there have to
be for Rowling to wish to manufacture only the fourteen-shot variety of integrated _Magicam_
given that the other variety is


a. ten-shot;
b. eight-shot.


We have seen that, like bundling, tie-ins can be used to implement price discrimination
schemes. This is no doubt one reason that tie-ins are frequently used, especially in situations
where one of the components, like our fictitious _Magicam_, is capable of different intensities
of use covering a very large range. Some tying is contractual, as in the case of IBM
requiring the use of its punch cards for users of its punch card machines in the early days of
computing. Some tying is technologically forced as in the _Magicam_ and _Magifilm_ example,
or in the real-world case where Polaroid instant picture cameras used only Polaroid film.
_Nintendo 64_ players and _Game Boys_ use only Nintendo or Nintendo-licensed games. Every
manufacturer of computer printers designs their printers so that they use only their own ink
cartridges. Again, these can be very useful product design strategies for extracting surplus
from the market.

Price discrimination is not the only reason, however, that we may observe bundling and
tying practices. As Judge Stevens made clear, an additional reason is that such practices
may enhance monopoly power. At the same time, we also need to recognize that bundling
and tying based on actual cost considerations will be observed in relatively competitive
markets where they have little to do with discriminatory practices. We turn to these issues
shortly, after first considering some aspects of complementary goods pricing.


8.3 COMPLEMENTARY GOODS, NETWORK EXTERNALITIES,
AND MONOPOLY PRICING


The _Magicam_ and _Magifilm_ are complementary goods. In the days before the advent of
digital cameras, there was no point in buying a camera—magical or otherwise—unless
one also bought some film. Today, there is little point in owning a CD player without
also purchasing CDs, an e-book reader without buying e-books, a PC without buying
some software applications, or in buying bolts without buying nuts. In passenger airline
manufacturing, it is necessary to have both engines and avionics equipment.

Sometimes the market for at least one of the complementary goods is reasonably
competitive. Other times, the same firm may control both goods. However, there is a
third possibility. This is that each of the complementary goods is produced by a different
monopolist. There might be just one camera corporation and one separate film company.

As the French mathematical economist, Augustin Cournot, recognized over 150 years ago,
this last situation may have particularly bad implications for both profit and efficiency.

Cournot’s (1838) basic insight can be shown fairly simply. Suppose that the two
complementary goods in question are nuts and bolts. A separate monopoly firm produces
each and, to keep things simple, marginal production cost for each firm is zero. (We
provide in the Appendix an alternative solution in which we allow the two firms to have
different marginal costs.) The two goods are perfect complements. A consumer who wants
to purchase 100 bolts also wants to purchase 100 nuts. In other words, the two goods are
always consumed in the fixed proportion of one-to-one. For this reason, consumers care
only about the combined price, _PB_ _PN_ _,_ in determining their demand. As you can see,
the demands for the two products are clearly interrelated. The price of bolts will affect the +
demand for nuts and vice versa.

Suppose that the demand for nut and bolt pairs is given by the demand function


_Q_ 12 _(PB_ _PN_ _)_ (8.10)
=  - +


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 193


Because consumers always buy the two goods together—one nut for every bolt—equation
(8.10) also describes the separate demand facing each monopolist. That is, the bolt producer
and the nut producer each face demand curves


_QB_ 12 _(PB_ _PN_ _)_ Bolt Demand Curve
=   - +

_QN_ 12 _(PB_ _PN_ _)_ Nut Demand Curve (8.11)
=   - +

The problem with separate production is easy to see. The nut producer’s pricing decision
affects the bolt producer’s demand curve, and vice versa. A change in the price of nuts not
only changes the quantity demanded in the nut market but also in the bolt market. This
implies that each firm’s pricing decision has profit implications not just for itself but for the
other firm as well. In other words, the pricing policy of either of the two firms imposes an
externality on the other firm. In this situation, we might reasonably expect that a merger or
creation of a business network to coordinate the pricing decisions of the two firms will offer
significant advantages for them by at least partially correcting the market failure associated
with the externality. Less obviously, but as we shall see nonetheless true, it is also possible
that consumers will gain from such coordination.

Let’s calculate the profit-maximizing decisions of the two firms, first without and then
with coordination between them. We can rewrite the demand curves of equation (8.11) in
inverse form.


_PB_ _(_ 12 _PN_ _)_ _QB_ Inverse Demand Curve for Bolts
=   -   
_PN_ _(_ 12 _PB)_ _QN_ Inverse Demand Curve for Nuts (8.12)
=   -   
From this we know that the marginal revenue curve facing each firm is


_MRB_ _(_ 12 _PN_ _)_ 2 _QB_ Bolt Marginal Revenue
=   -   
_MRN_ _(_ 12 _PB)_ 2 _QN_ Nut Marginal Revenue (8.13)
=   -   
Not surprisingly, just as each firm’s demand curve depends on the other firm’s price,
so each firm’s marginal revenue is affected by the other firm’s price. When each firm
independently maximizes its profit then each firm will choose an output where marginal
revenue equals marginal cost, here assumed to be zero. So, setting each of the equations in
(8.13) to zero and solving for _QB_ and _QN_ gives


_QB_ _(_ 12 _PN_ _)/_ 2 Bolt Production
=   
_QN_ _(_ 12 _PB)/_ 2 Nut Production (8.14)
=   
If we now substitute these outputs into the individual demand curves, we obtain each
firm’s optimal price as a function of the other firm’s price, as follows:


_PB_ _(_ 12 _PN_ _)/_ 2 Bolt Price Rule
=   
_PN_ _(_ 12 _PB)/_ 2 Nut Price Rule (8.15)
=   
These equations show that each producer’s corresponding profit-maximizing price
depends on the price set by the other firm. Alternatively, the equations identify each firm’s


194 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


profit-maximizing choice of price given the price of the other firm’s good. Whatever price
is being charged by the nut firm is communicated to the bolt firm through the effect on the
demand curve facing the bolt producer. If nut prices are high, the demand curve will be low.
Alternatively, if nut prices are low, bolt demand will be strong. Taking the demand curve
as given, the bolt producer simply picks the price–quantity combination that maximizes
profits using the familiar profit-maximizing _MR_ = _MC_ rule.

We can identify what the price equilibrium in the two markets will be by graphing
equations (8.15) in a diagram with the two prices _PB_ and _PN_ on the axes. This is done in
Figure 8.7. The more gently sloped line gives the bolt company’s best choice of _PB_ for
every nut price, _PN_ . For example, if the nuts were priced at zero, the profit-maximizing
bolt price would be $6. If the nut price rises to somewhere near $12 _,_ the profit-maximizing
bolt price falls to near zero. Higher nut prices reduce bolt demand and lower the bolt firm’s
profit-maximizing price. The more steeply sloped line describes the same strategic choices
from the perspective of the nut company. This line describes the profit-maximizing choice
of _PN_ for every choice of _PB._

Equilibrium occurs at the intersection. At this point, each firm has selected a price that
is best given the price choice of the other firm. Accordingly, neither has an incentive to
change. In order to identify this equilibrium, we substitute the equation for the nut price,
for example, into the equation for the bolt price. This gives

This tells us that the profit-maximizing bolt price is _PB_ $4. Substituting into equation
(8.15) gives the profit-maximizing nut price as _PN_ $4. As a result, the combined nut/bolt =
price is _PB_ _PN_ $8, and from the demand equation (8.10), the number of bolt and nut =
pairs sold is four. The bolt firm makes profits of + = _PBQB_ $16 _,_ as does the nut producer.

Now consider what happens if the two firms merge and the newly combined firm markets a =
single, “bundled nut-and-bolt” product. Such a firm faces the joint demand curve of equation
(8.10) and so recognizes that the relevant price to customers is the sum of individual bolt
and nut prices, or the total price paid for the bundled nut-and-bolt product. The marginal

revenue curve associated with the demand curve of equation (8.10) is _MR_ = 12 − 2 _Q,_
where _Q_ is the number of nut-and-bolt pairs sold. Equating marginal revenue with marginal
cost identifies the optimal quantity of nut-and-bolt pairs to sell. Because we have assumed
that marginal cost is zero, it is easy to see that the optimal quantity of nut-and-bolt pairs
that the merged monopolist should offer for sale is _Q_ [∗] = 6. The demand function then tells
us that each pair can be sold at a combined price of _P_ [∗] = $6 (or separate prices of $3 each).
The merged firm’s total profit is _P_ [∗] _Q_ [∗] = $36 _._

Comparing these values with those obtained earlier, when the firms set their prices
independently of each other, shows that a merger of the two firms leads to lower prices
and more output than when the two firms act separately. This is because the merged
firm understands the interaction of demands between the two products. As a result of
coordinating nut and bolt production and pricing, consumers are made better off by this
merger. Moreover, the profit of the combined firm exceeds the sum of profits earned by the
two separate firms. This was Cournot’s basic point. [8] By internalizing the interdependence
of the two firms, both consumers and producers gain.

Merger is not the only way to achieve this outcome. Alternative means of coordinating
the separate decisions of the two firms exist. For example, they could decide to form a
product network. Examples include Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) networks, airline
computerized reservation systems (CRS), real estate multiple-listing services (MLS),
markets for interactive components such as computer CPUs and peripherals, and longdistance and local telephone services. Where they exist, such networks have been created
by the joint action of many firms with the aim of taking better account of the interactions
between the demands for the firms’ complementary products.

Alternatively, we might hope for one or both markets to become competitive. If this
happened in only one of the two markets, say bolts, then the bolt price would fall to marginal
cost, which in this case was assumed equal to zero. Each firm in the bolt market would
be so small that it could not possibly impose any external effects on the nut-producing
monopoly. Given a zero price for bolts, equations (8.15) imply that the profit maximizing
price for nuts—and therefore of a nut-and-bolt combination—would be $6. Accordingly,
this outcome would duplicate that which occurs under merger. If both markets were to
become competitive, then bolt price and the nut price would each fall to marginal cost.
This, of course, would yield the maximum total surplus and all of that surplus would accrue
to consumers.

There is a factor that can work against the emergence of competition in markets for
complementary goods. That factor is the presence of network externalities. For some goods
and services, there is a scale economy effect that operates on the demand side of the market.
For example, the more consumers that are connected to a phone system, the more valuable
the phone system is to existing and new consumers. Each consumer who connects to the
phone system generates an external benefit to all those already connected and makes the
system more attractive to potential consumers. Sometimes this feature is described as a
positive feedback.

Product complementarities of the sort we have been discussing here can also give rise to
a positive feedback. Consider the Microsoft case. Microsoft’s operating system _Windows_
serves as the platform from which software applications such as word processing packages,


8 Allen (1938) made the same point with regard to the price-reducing effects of merging two complementarygoods monopolies. A calculus-based presentation of a more general form of our analysis is provided in the
Appendix.


196 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


computer games, and graphic arts programs can be launched. A technical aspect of this
relationship is that the code for a particular application must include an applications program
interface (API) in order to work with the operating system. Typically, the API that works
with one operating system will not work with another. In other words, applications such
as _Stata_ or _Mathematica_ must be written to work on a specific operating system such as
_Windows_, _Mac OS_, or _Linux_ . The two products, the applications and the operating system,
are therefore complements.

Two additional features of the design and production of applications programs are also
important. First, their production exhibits substantial scale economies. The cost is almost
entirely in the design phase. Once the underlying source code is written, the program can
be put on CD-ROMs (or websites) and sold (or downloaded) to millions of consumers
almost costlessly. Second, there is a network externality in that the more people use the
application, the more consumers will want to use it. It is convenient to know that I can put
my presentation graphics on a memory stick or in an e-mail attachment and have it read by
a colleague miles away because we both use the same graphics software. For both of these
reasons, firms that make these software applications have an incentive to design them to
work with the most widely used operating systems because this permits the firms to exploit
these supply-side and demand-side scale economies more effectively.

By exactly the same reasoning, the operating system that consumers will want the most is
the one for which there are the most applications. The complementary relationship between
applications and operating system has resulted in a very favorable positive feedback for
Microsoft’s _Windows_ . As _Windows_ became the dominant operating system, applications
were increasingly written to run on it. In turn, this ever-expanding menu of applications
greatly fortified the position of _Windows_ as the dominant system. This interaction is
sometimes called the _applications barrier to entry_ . The idea is that any would-be rival
operating system will have a great deal of difficulty entering the market. Applications
producers will not have an incentive to design their products to run on the alternative system
until it has a significant market share. Yet the system will never get any sizable market
share unless applications are written for it.

What this analysis suggests is that there is a countervailing force to the benefits from
closer coordination in the production and marketing of complementary products. Although
it is generally true that coordination is profitable and, as our nut and bolt example indicates,
is beneficial for consumers, when there is monopoly power in the production of the
complementary goods the network effects, and the positive feedback that they generate
means that monopoly power can be enhanced. This is one way in which monopoly power
in one product line could be extended or leveraged to others.


8.4 ANTITRUST, BUNDLING, AND TIE-IN SALES


We are now in a better position to consider the antitrust issues raised by bundling and
tie-ins. The main question is whether such practices may be used by firms with significant
market power either to sustain or to extend that power against competitors or potential
competitors. We illustrate these issues first with a review of the Microsoft case with which
we opened this chapter. We then briefly discuss other cases and legal developments in this
area. (See Economides and Salop (1992) for a more complete discussion.)


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 197


8.4.1 Bundling and the Microsoft Case


A central issue in the government’s case against Microsoft was the claim that Microsoft
had integrated or bundled its browser, _Internet Explorer_, directly into its operating system
_Windows_ as a means to eliminate the rival browser, Netscape’s _Navigator_, from the market.
The argument was that because Microsoft had monopoly power in the operating systems
market, every consumer of _Windows_ would now find _Internet Explorer_ as the default
browser thereby eliminating or greatly reducing Netscape’s market share. To prove its
claim and demonstrate a violation of the antitrust laws, the government would have to show
1) that Microsoft did possess monopoly power, 2) that an operating system and a browser
were two related but distinct products that did not need to be tightly bundled, and 3) that
Microsoft’s practices constituted an abuse of its power motivated by the firm’s desire to
maintain or extend its dominant position.

In light of the foregoing, it is worthwhile recalling Judge Jackson’s three key findings
of fact. First, the judge found that Microsoft is indeed a monopoly in the sense of the
Sherman Act. The evidence for this finding appears reasonably strong. At the time of the
trial, _Windows_ had over 90 percent of the operating systems market and had maintained
that share of the market for well over a decade. Additionally, Microsoft’s use of mixed
bundling and other price discriminatory practices provided further evidence of something
less than a competitive market. Both the structural and behavioral evidence provided some
support to Judge Jackson’s finding that Microsoft possessed monopoly power.

The judge’s second finding was that an operating system and an Internet browser are two
separate albeit complementary products. Microsoft had argued that a browser was really
just an integrated part of a modern operating system. Just as flash bulbs that used to be sold
separately had become technologically embedded in cameras themselves, Microsoft claimed
that similar technological developments had led it to make its browser, _Internet Explorer_,
an integral part of its _Windows_ operating system. Microsoft further alleged that separation
of the two could not be achieved without damaging at least one of them. However, the
fact remained that Netscape still marketed its _Navigator_ browser independently, suggesting
that consumers did not demand an integrated operating system and browsing experience. In
addition, evidence was presented at the trial showing that it was relatively easy to separate
_Internet Explorer_ from the operating system with which Microsoft had bundled it, without
harming either product. Therefore, Judge Jackson’s finding that _Windows_ and _Internet_
_Explorer_ are separate products could also be justified.

In light of these first two findings, Microsoft’s only remaining defense is that even
though it possesses monopoly power, its practice of bundling its distinct operating system
and browser products did not amount to “acting badly.” In other words, arguing that its
integration of _Windows_ and _Internet Explorer_ was not done with a view to hurt competition
but instead to help consumers in order to avoid a finding that it had violated the antitrust
laws. One way to make such a defense would be to pursue the coordination argument that
we discussed above. That is, Microsoft might argue that the complementarity between an
operating system and a browser requires coordination of the marketing of the two products
in order to ensure that consumers receive both goods at low prices. Microsoft could then
make a case that its behavior was in fact pro consumer.

As we saw in the previous section, the existence of a complementary relationship between
two products can lead to serious inefficiencies if each product is produced by a separate
monopoly. This was arguably the case in the software industry. Microsoft’s _Windows_
controlled the lion’s share of the operating systems market and Netscape’s _Navigator_


198 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


dominated the complementary browser market. There was a good case to be made that
some mechanism for coordinating the marketing of these two products was desirable. One
way to achieve this coordination is by means of a merger of the two firms. [9] What happens,
however, if one of the firms does not want to merge?

For example, suppose that Netscape feels that, as a much smaller company, any merger
would amount to its being swallowed up by Microsoft and losing all its managerial
independence. Its management might then decide to reject a merger proposal and to
continue the separate marketing of its browser. In these circumstances, we can imagine that
Microsoft might decide to create its own browser and bundle it with its operating system.

We can illustrate how the market outcome might evolve, again using our simple nut/bolt
example. Suppose that the demand by consumers who want both an operating system and a
web browser is given by


_Q_ 12 _(PO_ _PB)._ (8.17)
=  - +

where the subscripts “ _O_ ” and “ _B_ ” now indicate operating system and browser, respectively.
Again, let us also simplify by assuming that marginal costs for both products are zero. (We
noted earlier that for software, this assumption is actually quite realistic.)

Our nut/bolt example above tells us that, when operating independently, Microsoft will
sell its operating systems at _PO_ $4 and Netscape will sell its browser at _PB_ $4 _,_ so that
the price of a combined operating system and browser service is $8. We also know that = =
this is an inefficient outcome. If the two firms coordinate or become one firm, the price of a
combined system falls to $6. Total profit of the two firms would simultaneously rise.

If a merger with Netscape is rejected, Microsoft might then develop its own browser,
which we also assume can be produced at a marginal cost of zero. It would then appear that
Microsoft could offer the operating system at $3 and the browser at $3 _,_ or a package price
of $6. However, this ignores the competition from Netscape. If Microsoft proceeds with
this plan, Netscape can no longer offer its browser at a price of $4. It could, however, offer
to sell its browser at a price of $2. After all, this is still well above marginal cost. Moreover,
this price is sufficiently low that consumers would then be attracted to the Netscape browser
while still buying Microsoft’s operating system at the price of $3. Of course, Microsoft
would then want to reduce the price of its browser, perhaps to $1.95. Netscape would then
respond by selling its browser at perhaps $1.80 _,_ and so on.

What we have just described is an outbreak of price competition in the browser market.
The ultimate effect of this price competition will be to drive the browser price to marginal
cost—in this case to zero. This is certainly bad news for Netscape. What about Microsoft?
A review of its optimal pricing strategy as given by equations (8.17) implies that when
the browser price falls to zero, Microsoft’s optimal price for operating systems rises to $6.
Further, a browser price of 0 implies that $6 is also the best price for a combined operating
system and browser package—exactly as would occur if the two firms merged. Moreover,
the profit increase that a merger would bring is also realized, although it now goes entirely
to Microsoft. In other words, a merger is not the only way to solve the coordination problem.
Competition in one of the markets will remove the inefficiency that would otherwise result
when each market is monopolized and the monopolists fail to coordinate their pricing.
Prices are lower and both consumer and producer surplus have increased.


9 In June of 1995, Microsoft did in fact offer to work cooperatively with Netscape in the browser market
and, allegedly, even suggested a merger—a proposal that was rejected by Netscape.


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 199


It is insightful to note that the outcome of the “browser war” just described involves
a final browser price of zero. That is, in equilibrium Microsoft sells its operating system
for $6 and then throws in its browser for free. This looks very much like bundling, the
only complicating factor being that Netscape is also offering a free browser and so can be
expected to retain a share of the browser market.

Review of the foregoing scenario should make clear that the accusation that Microsoft
bundled its browser with its operating system to exploit its monopoly power and harm
competitors can be challenged. Microsoft could legitimately argue that it has simply acted
in a way that promotes price competition and that the lower browser prices are just a
reflection of this fact. In this view, Microsoft’s actions have been pro-competitive, not
anti-competitive.

There is, however, an additional aspect to the case that we must consider. This involves
the interaction between complementary products and network externalities. The complementarity between operating systems and the applications written for them has created a
substantial positive feedback loop for Microsoft. Because _Windows_ had a monopoly in
operating systems, the majority of applications were written to run on _Windows_ . In turn,
because most applications were written for _Windows_, no other operating system could
challenge the _Windows_ dominance. Internet browsers, however, offered a potential way
around this problem. The advent of the JAVA programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems and other technical advances make it possible to run applications on an
Internet browser. The browser itself therefore can serve as a platform from which to launch
applications.

If _Navigator_ can serve as an applications platform, then even after the development of
_Internet Explorer_, _Navigator_ would be expected to retain a reasonable share of the browser
market. In turn, the existence of this alternative platform with a substantial market share
means that design firms could begin to write their applications to run on an alternative to
_Windows_ . As this happened, _Navigator_ would benefit from the same positive feedback that
_Windows_ enjoyed. As more applications could be run from the browser, the browser would
become more popular and still more applications would be written for it. Clearly, such a
development would strike at the core of Microsoft’s success by leading to fierce competition
in the platform market. Testimony at the trial revealed that Microsoft management was both
aware and fearful of this development.

In light of the foregoing, Microsoft’s explicit bundling of _Internet Explorer_ with
its _Windows_ operating system takes on a different light. Instead of a competitive act that
reduces a coordination inefficiency between complementary products, Microsoft’s bundling
can also be viewed as a deliberate effort to reduce Netscape’s share of the browser market so
that the Netscape browser becomes an unattractive alternative to applications designers. In
turn, this would eliminate Netscape as a threat to Microsoft’s operating system monopoly.
Indeed, Microsoft initially required that PC manufacturers such as Compaq and Dell, who
installed _Windows_ as their operating system also install _Internet Explorer_ as the default
browser appearing on the _Windows_ desktop. They did this presumably on the supposition
that most consumers want only one browser even if a second can be obtained for free. The
subsequent integration of _Internet Explorer_ into the _Windows_ software could be viewed as
an attempt to replace contractual bundling with technological bundling.

Whatever the type of bundling, however, the foregoing analysis sees the motive as the
same—namely the prevention of Netscape developing a viable competitor to Microsoft.
This alternative interpretation of Microsoft’s behavior does imply a violation of the antitrust
laws because it alleges that Microsoft abused its power primarily to sustain its monopoly,


200 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


that is, to hurt competition. In support of this argument, the Justice Department offered
much suggestive evidence only a portion of which we can summarize here.

First, there were internal Microsoft documents revealing management’s concern over the
potential threat that Netscape might pose to the dominance of _Windows_ as the applications
platform. Second, some additional evidence of malicious intent was that in addition to its
bundling strategy that effectively required _Windows_ users to acquire _Internet Explorer_ as
their default browser, Microsoft also pressured Macintosh to support _Internet Explorer_ as its
default browser. It did so by refusing to develop applications, such as its _Office_ products, for
the Macintosh computers unless Macintosh complied. Because Macintosh computers do not
use the _Windows_ operating system, this action was hard to justify as reflecting a technical
improvement to _Windows_ in the way that an internal flash device was an improvement to
cameras. Finally, and perhaps even more damaging, was the fact that Microsoft actually
paid Internet service providers such as America-On-Line (AOL) to adopt its browser and
even gave AOL a space on the _Windows_ desktop. Because AOL competed directly with
Microsoft’s own Internet service, this action is again hard to understand except as a way to
foreclose the AOL market to Netscape. [See also Rubinfeld (2003)]

Ultimately, Judge Jackson found the evidence compelling that Microsoft abused its
market power and used bundling to extend its dominance to the browser market. To some
extent, this is what the appellate court later found as well. However, that court differed
strongly with Judge Jackson regarding his opinion that the appropriate remedy for violation
was to break up Microsoft into separate companies much as John D. Rockefeller’s Standard
Oil was broken up ninety years earlier. Instead, the court remanded the case to Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly who worked out a less drastic remedy based on restrictions on
Microsoft’s actions along with monitoring to ensure that those restrictions were enforced. [10]

While this settlement went forward and the case is now over, the issues it raised remain
to this day. As we noted in the introduction to this chapter, Microsoft continued to be
the object of European antitrust lawsuits most notably in connection with its audio-visual
software, _Media Player_ . Likewise, both Google and its Android operating systems have
been the focus of antitrust investigations rooted in bundling/tying and complementarities,
e.g., the Android operating system and its several mobile applications.


8.4.2 Antitrust Policy, Bundling, and Tying: Additional Developments


The issues raised in the Microsoft case are not new. The fear that large, established firms
could abuse their market power and prevent or eliminate competition is what lies at the
heart of antitrust policy. As noted in Chapter 1, Section 1 of the Sherman Act explicitly
proscribes monopoly power whenever its exercise weakens competition. Moreover, the
subsequent Clayton Act speaks rather directly to the issue of bundling or tying: “It shall
be unlawful _. . ._ to lease (or sell) goods _. . ._ on the condition, agreement, or understanding
that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods _. . ._ of a competitor
or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect _. . ._ may be _to substantially lessen_
_competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce_ ” [emphasis added].
While we postpone a formal analysis of anti-competitive tactics until Chapters 12 and 13,
now is a good time to consider antitrust policy responses to the anticompetitive potential of
bundling and tying.

Two key cases established a clear legal presumption against tie-in requirements. The first
was the United Shoe case of 1922. As a result of over fifty mergers, the United Shoe company
had emerged as the dominant maker of shoe-manufacturing machinery in the early twentieth


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 201


century with a market share on the order of 80 to 90 percent. Shoe-making uses a number
of machines, however, and United Shoe faced competition in at least some of these lines.
In leasing its machines to shoe manufacturers, it stipulated that the manufacturers could
not use any United Shoe machines in combination with those of other rival manufacturers
and also that the shoe manufacturers had to buy certain supplies exclusively from United
Shoe. Twenty-five years later, the court confronted a similar case with the International
Salt Company. That company refused to lease its salt processing machines unless the
lessee also agreed to purchase all of its salt from International Salt. In this case, the court
inferred International Salt’s monopoly power largely from the fact that the company had
a patent on its machines. The court found that both the United Shoe and International Salt
tying requirements violated the antitrust statutes. [10] In these cases and others (including one
involving IBM), the court emphasized the defendant firm’s monopoly power in the tying
good. As a result, the conventional legal wisdom was that tying requirements imposed by
large, dominant firms would almost constitute a _per se_ violation of the antitrust laws.

Over the years, the court’s views on tying mellowed. In part, this was the result of an
important insight of the Chicago School. This insight was that tying contracts as a means
of leveraging a firm’s power in one market to power in another would make little sense in
a wide class of cases. Recall our nut and bolt example. Assume that bolts are monopolized
but nuts are competitive. As we showed earlier, the bolt monopolist would then set a price
of $6 and earn a profit of $36. Suppose now that this monopoly bolt firm uses a tying clause
to require the use of its own nuts and thereby extends its monopoly power to this second
market, as well. We know that this would allow the firm to raise the price of nuts to say,
$2. However, if it does this, the firm will need to lower the bolt price to $4 because what
consumers really want is the nut-and-bolt combination and the profit-maximizing price for
that combination is still $6 _,_ and the maximum profit earned is still $36. The point of this
Chicago School argument is that there is a potential maximum monopoly profit in these
two markets and the monopolist can get all of the profit in the bolt market if the nut market
is competitive, thereby removing any incentive to extend its monopoly to nuts via a tying
requirement.

As both the Nalebuff (2007) theoretical model and the historical practice revealed by
the Microsoftcase shows, however, there is a qualification to this argument. When the
market for the tied good involves substantial scale or scope economies, an incumbent can
use tying (and bundling) and so leverage power from one market into another and can do
so profitably. Strategic use of these practices by an incumbent can serve to deny these
economies to rivals and potential entrants and thereby weaken or eliminate their ability to
compete in either of the tied good markets. As a result, the incumbent can preserve and
increase its profits by reaping those economies for itself.

Recognition that the leverage of market power may sometimes be anticompetitive has led
the court to move cautiously in relaxing its earlier strict rules against tying and bundling.
In 1960, the Supreme Court accepted the use of a tied-sales clause in a case involving
Jerrold Electronics Corporation, a pioneer in cable television systems and the community
antenna television (CATV) industry, because it felt that this was a legitimate way of
guaranteeing quality performance of a service in the early, developmental stage of an


10 _United Shoe Machinery Corp_ . v. _United States_, 258 U.S. 451 _International Salt Co. v. United States_, 332
U.S. 392 (1947). Peterman (1979) argues that the fact that firms were allowed to use salt from producers
other than International Salt if it was cheaper suggests that the real purpose of the tying was to reveal to
International Salt the pricing practices of its rivals.


202 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


industry. [11] Subsequently, in the 1984 _Jefferson Parish_ case, the Supreme Court attempted
to articulate a clear set of guidelines under which any such arrangement would be _per se_
illegal. The case involved a requirement by the Jefferson Parish Hospital that to use its
surgical services it was necessary to use the group of anesthesiologists with whom the
hospital had an exclusive contract. In its decision, which found for the hospital, the Court
stated three conditions, all of which would have to be met for the tie-in to violate antitrust
laws. [12] These are


1. the existence of two distinct products, the tying product and the tied one;
2. the firm tying the products must have sufficient monopoly power in the tying market to
force the purchase of the tied good; and
3. the tying arrangement must foreclose, or have the potential to foreclose, a substantial
volume of trade.


The logic behind these conditions is clear enough. It would be wrong, for example, to
consider a computer and its power cord as two separate products and then claim illegal
tying. Likewise, the anticompetitive abuse of market power is only plausible if a firm has
such power in the first place. Yet the result of these efforts in practice has been a curious
mixture of _per se_ and rule of reason standards. On the one hand, the _Jefferson Parish_
standards are meant to establish conditions under which bundling and tying are _per se_
illegal. On the other hand, the interpretation of those standards is open to enough variation
that a sort of rule of reason has emerged about whether they apply. Despite this ambiguity,
it remains the case that tying arrangements tend to be viewed more harshly than bundling
arrnagements by the anti-trust authorities. One result has been that plaintiffs may attempt
to argue that a bundling pratice is actually a tying arrangement.

One troubling feature of the foregoing judicial history is that so little attention has
been paid to cost-based reasons for bundling and tying. Yet there can be little doubt that
such cost-efficiencies are present. This is because we see bundling and tying requirements
in many competitive situations where neither price discrimination nor the extension of
monopoly power can be the motive. This point has been particularly emphasized in a series
of papers by Evans and Salinger (2005) and Evans (2006).

To understand the intuition of the Evans and Salinger (2005) argument, consider the case
of head cold remedies. Some cold sufferers primarily endure headaches and sore throats.
For these consumers, the main treatment they want is pain relief. Others, however, find
sinus congestion and irritation to be the main aggravating symptoms. These consumers
want a decongestant in their cold remedy. Of course, there is also a third group that wants
both a pain reliever and a decongestant.

As a specific example, let us assume that there are 50 people in each of the first two
groups and 100 in the third. Members of each group have a sufficiently high reservation
price that they will always buy the product. Let us also assume that to produce, package,
and market each cold remedy drug for this market incurs a fixed cost of $300. Further,
assume that the marginal cost of producing and packaging either a bottle of pain relief
medicine or a package of decongestants is $4 _,_ but that there are some marginal cost savings
in putting the two in one pill so that the marginal cost of a combined, pain reliever and

(1961).

Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 203


decongestant product is just $7. Finally, rather than assume a perfectly competitive market,
we will assume that there is just one firm. However, we will also assume that entry is easy
and costless so that that firm is constrained to offer products at prices that just permit it
to break even. Table 8.7, below shows the possible product offerings and the associated
zero-profit prices.

Let’s first think about our firm just offering the pain reliever and the decongestant
separately. The first group of consumers will buy the pain reliever, the second will buy
the decongestant, and the third group will want to buy both products. So, demand for each
product is 150 implying an average fixed cost for each drug of $300 _/_ 150 = $2. When
added to the marginal cost of $4 _,_ the break-even price is $6. However, this outcome is not
an equilibrium. Any firm could enter the market and sell just the bundle for $10.00. This
would attract all of the 100 consumers who want a combined medication, because they
currently pay $6 + $6 = $12 to get both types of relief. In turn, the loss of these customers
would make the continued offering of the two separate products at a price of $6 impossible
as the average cost of each of these would now rise to $10. Indeed, because this price is
the same as the bundle price, we might imagine that some of these consumers will actually
buy the bundle as it gives them the relief they want plus a little something extra. As this
happens, however, the bundle price falls further due to additional fixed cost savings while
the individual prices must rise further. This will push all 200 customers to buy the bundle
at which point the break-even price for the bundle drops to $8.50. This is, in fact, the only
sustainable price and product combination. It is therefore the equilibrium in this imperfectly
competitive but contestable market. [13]

The scenario just described is worth some reflection. Competitive pressures police the
market and force prices to equal costs. Even so, the firm in the market offers only the two
goods, pain reliever and decongestant, together in one package. No consumer can buy this
firm’s pain relief medicine without also buying its decongestant. This is definitely a case of
tying. Yet the tying is not done either to price discriminate or to extend monopoly power.
It is simply another result of the competitive pressure to offer low-cost medication.

The idea that competition underlies much of the tying and bundling we observe is
precisely the point that Evans and Salinger (2005) and Evans (2006) make. In their view,


**Table 8.7** Pure bundling as the sustainable equilibrium


_Demand Volume_ _Product_


_Pain Relief 50_ _Decongestant 50_ _Bundle 100_


_Costs_
Fixed Cost $300 $300 $300
Marginal Cost $4 $4 $7


_Possible Prices Under:_
Separate Goods $6 $6      Pure Bundling      -      - $8.5
Mixed Bundling $10 $10 $10
Bundle and Good 1 $10      - $9
Bundle and Good 2      - $10 $9


13 A review of Table 8.7 will make it clear why either mixed bundling or offering a bundle and one good
separately also cannot be an equilibrium.


204 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


these practices are far too common to be explained either by price discrimination or
monopolization motives. They note as well that even when price discrimination is the
cause, the market outcome does not merit policy intervention. Hence, the only time that
tying or bundling is definitely harmful is when it is used for leveraging market power. Given
that some large scale and possibly scope economies are required to make the leveraging
argument powerful, these authors and others have argued that all attempts at a _per se_ illegal
rule is misguided. Instead, they call for an explicit use of a rule of reason with a general
presumption that the tying is legal unless the intent and ability to extend market power is
explicitly shown.


8.5 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: BUNDLING IN CABLE TV


As we have seen, the enhanced profitability that a firm with market power can gain from
bundling stems from reducing the variation in consumers’ willingness to pay. As a result,
selling the bundle to a large range of consumers requires a much smaller price reduction
than selling each product individually to an equally large group. In other words, bundling
makes demand more sensitive to prices—more price elastic.

The prediction that bundling makes demand more elastic and that, as a result, it can be
used to enhance a firm’s profit is examined in recent work by economist Gregory Crawford
(2008) in the specific case of cable television. The intuition is straightforward. Any one
cable channel is likely to have some viewers who like it a lot and are willing to pay a great
deal for it and others who do not value it very much and are not willing to pay much at all
for its inclusion as part of a cable service. Hence, by combining more stations in its Basic
Service offering, the cable service provider eliminates the extreme values and shrinks the
dispersion of the customer population’s willingness to pay for the overall bundle.

For example, a useful measure of dispersion of a variable is the coefficient of variation
defined as the ratio of a variable’s standard deviation to its mean. Let consumer _i_ have a
willingness to pay for network _j_ be of _αij_ and let this be distributed normally across the
population of consumers with a mean ~~_α_~~ and variance _σ_ [2] _,_ common to all networks. For a
cable service that includes _n_ networks, consumer _i_ ’s willingness to pay for the entire cable
service _Vi_ is therefore:



_Vi_
=




- _n_


_j_ =1



_αij_ (8.18)



Of course, the average willingness to pay for the cable network will just be: _V_ = ~~_nα_~~ _._



If we assume that each _αij_ is distributed independently, then the standard deviation of the
total willingness to pay _Vi_ will be given by _σ_ ~~[√]~~ ~~_n_~~ . Hence, the coefficient of variation for the
_Vi_ will be:



Coefficient of Variation _[σ]_ ~~[√]~~ ~~_[n]_~~
= ~~_nα_~~




~~_[n]_~~ _σ_

(8.19)
~~_nα_~~ = ~~_α_~~ ~~[√]~~ ~~_n_~~



This clearly shrinks as the number _n_ of cable stations bundled together in the package
increases. Moreover, this shrinkage will be even greater if, instead of independent station
valuations, the valuations for at least some of the stations are negatively correlated. That
is, if those customers who tend to have either very high or very low valuations for say,


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 205


station 1, have inversely, very low or very high valuations for station 2, then putting these
two stations together in one cable package will shrink the variation of the bundle even more.

Crawford (2008) investigates these effects using data from 1,159 cable systems offered
across the United States in 1996. Cable service operators typically offer different types
of bundled packages. One of these is a Basic Service package that usually includes the
major broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC as well as cable networks
such as ESPN, CNN, and MTV. In more recent years, the Basic Services package has
been further differentiated into one limited bundle that hast just a subset of broadcast and
cable networks, and an Expanded Basic Services that includes a larger collection of such
networks. In addition, cable operators also typically offer unbundled premium channels such
as HBO to which customers may subscribe in addition to either a Basic or Expanded Basic
Service. However, it is the fixed bundle of which the component stations are only accessible
as part of that complete package that is the focus of Crawford’s (2008) investigation.

Specifically, Crawford (2008) estimates a demand for cable services equation with a view
to testing two hypotheses. First, does demand grow more elastic as additional networks are
added to the bundle? Second, is the increase in elasticity particularly large when a network
whose valuations are likely to be negatively correlated with those of other networks are
added to the bundle?

The essential details of Crawford’s (2008) approach are as follows. For the period covered
by his data, the fifteen most important cable networks are: WTBS, the Discovery Channel,
ESPN, USA, CSPAN, TNT, the Family Channel, the Nashville Channel, Lifetime, CNN,
A&E, the Weather Channel, QVC, the Learning Channel, and MTV. Most Basic Service (or
Expanded Basic Service) packages offer some of these in addition to broadcast networks.
Some offer all of them. Note that some of these cable networks are not general interest
stations but instead appeal to a narrow consumer interest. Thus, MTV caters to young
adults while Lifetime focuses primarily on the concerns of adult women. It is these special
interest channels for which consumer values are most likely to be negatively related to the
consumer valuations of the general interest stations. Thus, it is especially as these stations
are included that the elasticity of demand ought to increase.

Crawford (2008) therefore specifies a cable service demand equation as follows:



_w_ [∗] _sn_

[=] _[ X]_ [′]



_sn_ _[β]_ [ +] _[ D]_ [′]



_n_ _[θ]_ _s_ _s_

addition of a cable station makes demand more elastic—more sensitive to price—then the _γ_
estimates should be negative. Crawford’s (2008) basic estimates and their implications for
demand elasticity are shown in Table 8.8 below. The values in bold indicate the statistically
significant estimates.

Of course, changes in the level of demand and changes in the slope will each affect the
estimated price elasticity. For our purposes then, the third column of Table 8.7 is the critical
one. It shows the ultimate impact on the demand elasticity when both the level and slope

effects are taken into account. Here, the price elasticity of demand is taken as a negative
number. So, anything that makes that elasticity significantly more negative makes demand
more sensitive to price—precisely the hypothesized effect for bundling.

It is easy to see that eleven of the fifteen major cable offerings increase the price elasticity
of cable service demand and that for nine of these this effect is statistically significant.


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 207


This is of course precisely what is predicted by the bundling literature. Overall, the average
effect across all of the top fifteen stations is to raise the absolute value of elasticity by 0.16.

It is also noteworthy that the strongest elasticity-raising effects come from those cable
stations catering to specialized tastes. Crawford (2008) identifies TBS, USA, TNT, Family
Channel, A&E, and the Nashville Network as largely general interest channels, while
Discovery, ESPN, Lifetime, the Weather Channel, QVC, MTV, and the Learning Channel
all serve consumers with more specialized interests. Indeed, Crawford’s (2008) estimates
imply that the average elasticity effect of adding one of the specialized networks to the
basic cable service is to increase (in absolute terms) the elasticity by a very significant
0.197. In contrast, adding one of the general interest stations has a much more modest and
insignificant effect of increasing that elasticity by 0.1. Again, this is precisely what the
theory predicts.

In short, Crawford’s (2008) analysis suggests that cable service companies know what
they are doing when they bundle channels together and offer them as either a Basic Services
or Expanded Basic Services package. Moreover, this bundling pays off. Recall our simple
model of consumer preferences and willingness to pay for each of the separate stations.

Crawford’s next step is to take the elasticity effects shown in Table 8.7 above and to
work out the ultimate profit and consumer surplus that are consistent with each of those
effects. Given his estimates, he focuses this exercise on the effects of adding one of the
top, special interest cable interest networks to the cable operator’s bundle. He finds that
this typically raises the firm’s profit by 4.7 percent while reducing consumer surplus by 5
percent. Thus, as with most price discrimination schemes, producers gain and consumers
lose. In Crawford’s model, producer surplus is a bit larger to begin with so the overall
surplus increases slightly. Bundling hurts those consumers who really only care about
access to a few stations but who end up buying the entire bundle to get them. Again, this is
what economic theory predicts.


**Summary**



In this chapter, we have shown that a firm with
monopoly power in more than one product line
may have additional opportunities to price discriminate. By bundling its two goods together as
a package or, more generally, by tying the sale
of one good to the purchase of the other, the firm
can induce customers to sort themselves out by
their purchase and _ex post_ identify who is who.
This permits charging a higher net price to those
consumers with a greater willingness to pay.

the quantity demanded of both, sales coordination may occur for reasons other than price
discrimination. In the absence of such coordination through a merger or a business network,
for example, the separate production and marketing of two complementary products will typically
raise prices, reduce output, and reduce profits. By
taking account of the interrelationship between



the demand for each product, coordination potentially offers benefits to both consumers and firms
alike.

There can, however, be a downside to both
bundling and tie-in sales. In cases in which large
scale economies are present, these strategies may
enable a firm to extend its market power in
one product to another product line. Indeed, our
analysis shows that bundling can be a powerful and credible entry-deterring practice. This
was the charge against Microsoft, and it is the
central issue in antitrust cases involving tie-in
requirements.

However, it is worthwhile recognizing that
some fairly strong market conditions have to be
met for this outcome to prevail. It is equally
worthwhile to remember that much of the tying
and bundling occurs in fairly competitive markets. In such cases, there is some presumption
that the practices are cost efficient. It follows that


208 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice



when we observe firms with market power using
the same tactics, the goal of cost minimization
may again be the reason.

So far, our analysis has focused on the strategic
choices of a monopoly firm either acting alone
or interacting in a second market that is also
monopolized. The next step is to consider firms’
strategies in the context of imperfect competition


**Problems**


1. A university has determined that its students fall into two categories when it comes
to room and board demand. University planners call these two types Sleepers and Eaters.
The reservation prices for a dormitory room
and the basic meal plan of the two types are
as follows:

Sleepers Eaters
Dorm Room $5,500 $3,000
Meal Plan $2,500 $6,000


Currently, the university offers students the
option of selecting just the dorm room at
$3,000 _,_ just the meal plan at $2,500 _,_ or both
for a total price of $5,500. An economic consultant advises the university to stop offering
the two goods separately and, instead, to
sell them only as a single, combined room
and board package. Explain the consultant’s strategy and determine what price
the university should set for the combined
product.


2. Bundling is not always superior to nonbundling. To see this, consider a telecommunications firm that offers both phone service
and a high-speed modem service. It has two
types of consumers who differ in their willingness to pay a monthly rental fee for either
service.

Talkers Hackers
Phone Service $30 $ _a_
High-Speed Connection $16 $24


Determine for what values of _a_ bundling
would be more profitable than not bundling.


3. Many years ago, the major alternative to
xerography in copying was the Electrofax



where there are just a few firms interacting as
opposed to one or many. In such a setting, a firm
can no longer simply address the issue of how
to extract greater surplus from consumers. Each
firm must now also consider how its production
and pricing strategies affect not just consumers
but the other rival firms. This is the stuff of game
theory and it is to this topic that we turn next.


copying process. Electrofax machines used
a special paper coated with a heavy wax
film. Like Xerox, the Electrofax companies
charged a low price for the use of the machine
but set a paper price per page of 4 cents. The
actual and marginal cost of manufacturing
the paper was, in fact, only 1 cent per page.


a. Explain the pricing policy of the Electrofax producers.
b. The high markup on Electrofax paper
soon attracted new firms offering to supply the paper at a much lower price than
the Electrofax producers. How do you
think Electrofax would respond to this
competition?


4. Computer software, S, and hardware, H,
are complementary products used to produce computer services. Customers make a
one-time purchase of hardware, but buy various amounts of software. That is, once the
hardware is purchased, the price of additional computer services is PS _,_ the price of
a unit of software. The software market is
competitive. However, the hardware market
is monopolized by the firm, HAL, Inc. The
cost of producing software and hardware is
cS and cH _,_ respectively:

a. Assume that all users of computer services are alike, that is, have the same
demand curve for computer services.
Use a graph to describe the profitmaximizing price HAL can charge.
b. Would HAL gain anything by buying
software at the competitive price, branding it as its own, and then selling its
hardware only to customers who use the
HAL-brand software?


5. LRW runs a railroad line from New York
to Philadelphia, the LRW line. At present,
fixed costs are reasonably large, making it
difficult for others to enter the market. Later,
Nat Skape discovers that there is a market
for travel from Philadelphia to Washington
that is sufficiently large to permit offering
passenger service between these two cities.
His service is called the NSRR. Over time,
both the LRW Line and the NSRR learn
that many, though not all, of the customers
riding from Philadelphia to Washington are
actually passengers who originated in New
York.


a. What pricing issues arise between the
LRW Line and the NSRR?
b. Imagine that once it has incurred the
sunk costs of setting up the Philadelphia
to Washington line, it is possible that
with a little experience, NSRR may be
able to enter successfully the New York
to Philadelphia market. Imagine further
that before such entry occurs, the LRW
Line builds an extension to Washington and offers riders from New York
the advantage of service to Washington
without the need to change trains. How

OPTIMAL PURE BUNDLE PRICE


From equation (8.3)

_B_ [2] _[/]_ [2][ =] _[ (]_ [1][ −] _[p]_ [2]



_B_ _[/]_ [2] _[)]_ (8A.1)



and profit from the pure bundling strategy from equation (8.4)


_πB(pB)_ = _DpB_ _(_ 1 − _pB_ [2] _[/]_ [2] _[)]_ (8A.2)

Maximization of _πB_ with respect to _pB_ yields: _pB_ = [√] ~~2~~ _/_ ~~3~~ = 0.816 _._


ENTRY-DETERRING LIMIT PRICE


From equation (8.5) the profit of the entrant is:


_π_ E _Dp_ 2 _(_ 1 _p_ 2 _)_ _F_ (8A.3)
=   -   
Equating this to zero using the substitution _f_ = _F/D_ gives:

_p_ 2 [2] 2

[−] _[p]_ [+] _[ f]_ [ =][ 0]

The solution to this consistent with the constraint _p_ 2 _<_ 1:

OPTIMAL ENTRY PRICE WITH PURE BUNDLING


If the incumbent adopts pure bundling with bundle price _pB,_ the entrant’s profit equation
(8.9) is:


_πE_ _Dp_ 2 _(_ 1 _p_ 2 _)(pB_ _p_ 2 _)_ _F._ (8.A5)
=   -   -   
Maximizing this with respect to _p_ 2 again yields a quadratic equation with relevant solution:

OPTIMAL MIXED BUNDLING PRICES


From Figure 8.6, mixed bundling splits consumers into four groups: those who purchase
only product 1, those who purchase only product 2, those who purchase the bundle and
those who purchase nothing.

Consumers who purchase only product 1 are those in the rectangle _dab_ whose area is
_(_ 1 _p_ 1 _)(pb_ _p_ 1 _)_ . Consumers who purchase only product 2 are those in the rectangle _hef_
whose area is − - _(_ 1 _p_ 2 _)(pb_ _p_ 2 _)_ . Consumers who purchase the bundle lie in the market
area _deah_, which is defined by the rectangle of area − - _(_ 1 _(pb_ _p_ 1 _))(_ 1 _(pb_ _p_ 2 _))_ minus
the triangle of area _(p_ 1 _(pb_ _p_ 2 _))(p_ 2 _(pb_ _p_ 1 − _))/_ 2. It follows that the profit from − - mixed bundling is given by: − - -

FIRMS WITH COMPLEMENTARY GOODS AND NONZERO
MARGINAL COSTS


Let demand for nuts and bolts be: _QN_ _QB_ _A_ _PN_ _PB_ . Let marginal cost of the
nut and bolt production be _cN_ and _cB_ respectively. With separate production, profit of the = = - nut producer is: _πN_ _(PN_ _cN_ _)QN_ _(PN_ _cN_ _)(A_ _PN_ _PB)_ . Maximization with
respect _PN_ yields: = - = - - 

_PN_ _(A_ _cN_ _PB)/_ 2 (8A.10)
= +   

212 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


By symmetry it follows immediately that the profit-maximizing bolt-pricing rule is:


_PB_ _(A_ _cB_ _PN_ _)/_ 2 (8A.11)
= +   
Jointly solving (8A.10) and (8A.11) yields:



_PN_ = _[A]_ [ +][ 2] _[c]_ 3 _[N]_ [ −] _[c][B]_



3 _[N]_ [ −] _[c][B]_ ; and _PB_ = _[A]_ [ +][ 2] _[c]_ 3 _[B]_ [ −] _[c][N]_

If the two firms merge, their joint profit is:


_πM_ _(P_ _cN_ _cB)(A_ _P)_ (8A.13)
=   -   -   
Maximization with respect to _P_ yields:


_P_ _[A]_ [ +] _[ c][n]_ [ +] _[ c][B]_ (8A.14)
= 2



Comparison of this price _P_ with the sum of _PN_ and _PB_ in (8A.12) reveals that _P_ is

lower by _[n]_ _[B]_, while profits are higher. Both consumers and producers gain from

## **Part Three**
# **Strategic Interaction and Basic** **Oligopoly Models**

In the next three chapters, we present our analysis of markets populated by just a few
firms, that is, oligopolies. In such a setting, the actions of any one firm can change the
market environment, for example the market price, not just for itself but for all firms. Thus,
such actions will induce reactions that will in turn prompt further actions, and so on. This
interaction is of course recognized by each firm and plays a crucial role in determining
each firm’s strategic choices. Because game theory is the formal framework for analysis
of strategic interaction, the next three chapters present the basic game theoretic models of
oligopoly behavior.

In Chapter 9, we present the Nash equilibrium concept. We then develop the Cournot
model of quantity competition and show that it is consistent with the Nash equilibrium
concept, even as the number of firms expands beyond two and differences in costs emerge
between them. We conclude with an empirical application based on the Brander and Zhang
(1990) paper that supports the modeling of airline competition as consistent with the
Cournot predictions.

An important insight of game theory is that the outcome of any game is heavily dependent
on the rules of the game. In the Cournot model, firms compete in quantities or production
levels. Chapter 10 therefore presents the major rival to the Cournot model, namely, the
Bertrand model, which assumes firms compete in prices. Because price competition can be
particularly fierce when firms sell homogenous goods, the Bertrand assumption also gives
firms an important motivation for differentiating their products. Hence, we also use this
chapter to introduce price competition in the spatial setting first considered by Hotelling
(1929). We explore price competition in a setting of differentiated consumer tastes by
reviewing Hasting’s (2004) empirical study of gasoline prices in southern California in the
1990s.

Finally, in Chapter 11, we consider a different alteration of the Cournot analysis, namely,
the order of play. The Stackelberg model of Chapter 11 retains the Cournot assumption of
quantity competition but now assumes that one firm plays first, i.e., chooses its production
level before its rivals. This permits consideration of the benefits of incumbency and first
mover advantages, more generally. We then discuss the experimental work of Huck M¨uller,
and Normann (2001), providing experimental evidence on the Stackelberg versus the
Cournot model.
