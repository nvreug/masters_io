#### **Preface to the Fifth Edition**

We are greatly pleased by the publication of the fifth edition of _Industrial Organization:_
_Contemporary Theory and Practice_ . It is gratifying to have such continued market
confirmation of our conceptualization of the field and its major contributions—in particular,
that the application of rigorous thinking about strategic interaction yields important and
testable insights into real world events. We believe that this edition of our textbook renews
this message.

Overall, the organization of the book is roughly the same as the previous edition but
there are important changes. The two chapters on price-fixing and anti-trust policy vis-`a-vis
collusion (Chapters 14 and 15 in the fourth edition) have been streamlined and combined
into one chapter. The same is true for the formerly two separate chapters on advertising
(Chapters 20 and 21 in the fourth edition). More importantly, we have added a new
chapter on strategic interaction as it applies to international competition and the scope this
introduces for strategic trade policies. The net change is one less chapter and a more concise
text.

The two most substantive changes, however, are: 1) the inclusion of a somewhat
extended discussion of a single empirical study in each chapter; and 2) the shift of all
calculus derivations to chapter appendices. The first of these builds on the innovation in
the fourth edition in which we included an empirical study in roughly every other chapter.
Finding studies that are both appropriate for each chapter’s subject matter and also well
suited to the statistical training of the variety of students using the text is not an easy
task. However, we believe that we have done a good job in this respect. This includes
the inclusion of a straightforward empirical comparison of antitrust enforcement across
countries in the introductory first chapter.

Shifting the calculus sections to the appendix will, we hope, make the book more usable
for those teaching classes without a strong mathematics prerequisite while still making that
material available for those who want a more formal approach. This is not to say that there
is no math in the current text. We still include a lot of algebra and derive a lot of results
from the first order condition of marginal revenue equal to marginal cost. Algebraic analysis
is also prevalent in the empirical applications of each chapter. However, those seeking a
formal calculus presentation fully integrated into the primary text may be better served by
the quantitative alternative version, _Contemporary Industrial Organization: A Quantitative_
_Approach_ .

### **Part One**
## **Foundations**

We begin our study of industrial organization by reviewing the basic building blocks of
market analysis. The first chapter provides a road map for the entire enterprise. Here,
we describe the central aim of industrial organization, namely, the investigation of firm
behavior and market outcomes in settings of less than perfect competition. We emphasize
that an understanding of strategic interaction is a critical component of this analysis. We
end the chapter with a study by Nicholson (2008) relating the strength of active antitrust
policy to exposure to trade and measures of economic development.

In Chapter 2, we review the basic microeconomics of the two polar textbook cases of
perfect competition and pure monopoly. This permits the introduction of basic supply and
demand analysis, as well as the notions of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and total
surplus necessary for welfare evaluation of market outcomes. In addition, we introduce
intertemporal considerations, discounting, and the Coase durable goods conjecture. We
conclude with a review of the Chevalier and Goolsbee (2009) paper testing the rational
forward-looking behavior reflected in student textbook purchasing decisions.

Chapter 3 focuses on how we might identify those markets where market power is likely to
be a problem. This is an obvious place to introduce such measures as the _n_ -firm concentration
ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. However, we also take the additional step of introducing the most explicit measure of monopoly price distortions, namely, the Lerner Index.
This includes an extended empirical application explaining the many attempts at measuring
the economy-wide welfare loss from such distortions beginning with Harberger (1954).

Finally, in Chapter 4, we turn to a discussion of some of the reasons that markets may
exhibit the structural conditions that make perfect competition unlikely. Chief among these
are cost considerations, and it is in this chapter that we explore cost concepts most formally.
We review the notion of marginal cost that has already been introduced and then turn
our attention to those remaining cost concepts that most directly relate to market structure
such as sunk costs, average cost, and both scale and scope economies. We also explore
the implications of endogenous sunk cost as emphasized by Sutton (1991). Chapter 4 also
includes an empirical application based on the early work of Pulley and Braunstein (1992),
investigating scale and scope economies in the banking sector.


#### **1** **Industrial Organization: What, How, and Why**

A sample of business press from just the last few years includes the following items:
the emergence of a price war in the e-reader market involving Amazon’s _Kindle_ and
Barnes & Noble’s _Nook_ and even Apple’s _iPad_ ; guilty pleas from ten (so far) real estate
investors admitting that they colluded to rig bids at public foreclosure auctions in California;
widespread evidence that hospitals charge different prices for the same procedure depending
on who the patient is (including evidence that the uninsured are often charged _higher_ prices);
and the filing of a suit by the US Department of Justice to block a proposed merger between
two large mobile phone companies, AT&T and T-Mobile.

Students often feel that there is a considerable gap between stories like those just
described and the economics they study in the classroom. This is so despite the fact that
most modern texts include real world applications. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a
contemporary economics textbook that does not include examples drawn from the practical
business experience. Nevertheless, it is still far from unusual to hear remarks such as
“economics is too abstract” or “this wasn’t covered in the microeconomics that I studied.”

This book is very much in keeping with the modern practice of illustrating the applications
of economic theory. Our aim is, however, more ambitious than just showing that economics
can illuminate the everyday events of the business world. Our goal is to develop a way
of thinking about such experiences—a mental framework that permits students to form
hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying such events and to consider how to test those
hypotheses against empirical evidence. Of course, we cannot offer a single framework for
analyzing all economic phenomena, but we can develop one that applies to a large class of
events including the ones described above. That framework lies at the heart of the field that
economists call industrial organization.


1.1 WHAT IS INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION?


What is industrial organization? Certainly for those outside the economics profession,
the answer to that question is far from clear. In fact, probably no subfield of economics
has a less informative name. Unlike those working in international trade, environmental
economics, and most other economics fields with highly self-explanatory titles, those of us
working in industrial organization can rarely expect non-economists to understand what we


Industrial Organization: What, How, and Why 3


do from the name of the field alone. One possible answer to the question is that industrial
organization has to do with how market production is arranged. Another is that it is really
applied business economics. Yet while each of these responses has a grain of truth, each
is also wide of the mark. In our view, the simplest and most direct answer is that the field
of industrial organization is that branch of economics that is concerned with the study of
imperfect competition with the further qualification that this is done almost exclusively in
a partial equilibrium framework.

Given that you are reading this book, the chances are very good that you have had
some economics classes, especially microeconomics classes, already. As a result, you have
probably been exposed to the concept of perfect competition—that somewhat utopian vision
of markets populated by numerous small firms and characterized by economic efficiency.
You are also likely to have read about the most obvious counter example, pure monopoly.
The case of a market dominated by one firm alone offers a clear contrast to the ideal
of perfect competition. But what happens when the truth lies, as it almost always does,
between these two polar extremes? What happens when there are two, or three, or several
firms? How do competitive forces play out when each firm faces only a limited number of
rivals? Will prices be driven to (marginal) costs, or will advertising and other promotional
tactics avert this outcome? Will research and development of new products be the major
source of competitive pressure? If so, how do monopolies come about? If firms can obtain
monopoly power, can they also devise strategies to maintain such power? Is it possible to
keep new competitors from coming into the market?

Industrial organization forms the analytical core that economists use to answer these and
many other related questions. Economists long ago worked out the analytics of perfect
competition. What happens under the more common setting of imperfect competition—how
close to or how far from working like the perfectly competitive market—is much less settled.
This less settled domain is the field of industrial organization.

There is a good reason that industrial organization does not yield clear and simple answers
regarding what happens in imperfectly competitive markets. When we describe a market as
less than perfectly competitive, that still leaves open a wide range of possibilities. It could
be a duopoly market with only two firms, or perhaps a market dominated by one large firm
competing with many very small ones. The products of the different firms may be identical,
as in the case of cement manufacturers, or perhaps highly differentiated, as in the case
of cosmetics. Entry by new firms may be easy, as in the restaurant business, or difficult,
as in the automobile industry. This variety of possible market characterizations makes
it very difficult to make broad, unambiguous statements about imperfectly competitive
markets.

Matters become even more complicated when we consider the decisions that the
management of an imperfectly competitive firm must make. Start with perhaps a simple
case such as a florist setting the price for a dozen roses. Should the price rise on Valentine’s
Day? Should the price for a dozen be exactly twelve times the price of a single rose? Or
should the prospective buyer of flowers get a break if he or she buys in quantity?

Consider Jody Adams, the chef at one of the Boston area’s top restaurants, _Rialto_ . Jody
must choose the complete menu of entrees and appetizers that the restaurant will serve at the
start of each season as well as set the price of each menu entry. In making this choice, she
must evaluate the cost and availability of different ingredients. For example, what seafood
and vegetables are in season and can be served fresh? What price should she set for a
la carte items and for the fixed price meal? Should she make available special dishes for
those patrons with food allergies? How extensive a wine list should she maintain? These


4 Foundations


decisions make clear that product design decisions are just as important as pricing decisions.
A critical design choice by Microsoft to package its Web browser, _Internet Explorer_ with
its _Windows_ operating system and to sell the two as one product was perhaps the primary
reason for _Internet Explorer’s_ success against _Netscape_ . It also played a major role in the
government’s later decision to pursue antitrust charges against Microsoft.

Price and product design choices are not the only decisions that firms make, however.
Another choice concerns promotional effort. For example, in September 2011, the soft-drink
giant Pepsi announced that it had completed a new deal as an official sponsor of the National
Football League extending from 2012 through the 2022 season. Under this deal, _Pepsi Max_
will continue as the official soft drink of the NFL and _Gatorade_ will continue its ubiquitous
presence along the field sidelines of both teams. Pepsi also keeps the right to use the logos
of the Super Bowl and other league properties in ads, signs, and banners. However, the deal
is estimated to have cost Pepsi more than $2.3 billion over its ten-year life or a little over
$200 million per year. What economic rationale can justify this expenditure?

Somewhat similarly, September 2011 also witnessed the introduction of Amazon’s _Kindle_
_Fire_ as a direct competitor to Apple’s _iPad_ . What made this the right time for Amazon’s
entry into this market? What tactics might Amazon use to insure the success of this venture?

Firms make tough decision like the ones just discussed on a daily basis. Industrial
organization economists analyze those decisions and try to derive some predictions from
that analysis to help us understand market outcomes. We also try to test those predictions
using modern statistical analysis. This is the heart of what industrial organization is.


1.2 HOW WE STUDY INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION


One reason that analyzing imperfect competition is difficult is because of the interdependence that characterizes the firms’ decisions in their markets. When Amazon introduces the
_Kindle Fire_, it has to recognize that this will have a non-trivial effect on the other makers of
smart tablets. They may react by cutting prices, or by changing their installed applications,
or perhaps by cutting back on production so as to avoid a glut on the market. Similarly,
when Pepsi thinks about putting in a high bid to become the National Football League’s
official soft drink, it has to wonder how Coke will respond. Will it bid even higher or
pursue a similar contract with an alternative sports league? Will it instead “punish” Pepsi
by launching a price war in the soft drink market?

As these examples indicate, imperfect competition is played out against a background of
interdependence or, what economists call, a setting of strategic interaction. This means that
determining a firm’s optimal behavior can also be difficult. Because the firms are likely to
be aware of the interdependency of their actions, each firm will wish to take into account its
rivals’ response to its action. Yet that response will also depend on how the rivals think the
first firm will react to their reaction and so on. A firm in this situation needs to put itself in
its rival’s shoes to see how the rival will respond to different actions that the firm could take.
The firm must do this to figure out what its best course of action is. To understand the logic
of strategic interaction, we use game theory. Game theory provides us with the necessary
framework for an analysis of settings in which the participants or players recognize that
what they do affects other players and, in turn, what other players do affects them. It is
for this reason that much of the recent work in industrial organization uses game theory to
understand market outcomes under imperfect competition. While not all of the analysis in


Industrial Organization: What, How, and Why 5


this book relies on game theory, a good bit of our discussion is aimed at developing and
applying the logic of game theory to market settings.

The ability of game theory to permit a clear and logically consistent analysis of strategic
interaction makes it an indispensable tool in industrial organization. It is equally important,
however, to recognize that game theory and, more generally, the understanding of strategic
interaction serves a broader goal of understanding how industrial organization analysis is
conducted. This perhaps is best expressed by reference to a quote from John Maynard
Keynes who wrote insightfully, “the theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled
conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an



![](/Users/nicholasvreugdenhil/ASU Dropbox/Nicholas Vreugdenhil/masters_io_2026/external/peppall_textbook_chunks/markdown/peppall_textbook_chunk01_p001-025_images/peppall_textbook_chunk01_p001-025.pdf-16-2.png)




6 Foundations


apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking which helps its possessor to draw correct
conclusions.” [1] The same can be said for modern industrial organization. Investigating
imperfect competition requires a technique of thinking. To be precise, it requires a way of
thinking strategically and applying the insights to market behavior and outcomes.

Of course, no model is a complete description of reality. A complete detailing of each
aspect of the actual marketplace would be far too lengthy and unwieldy to be of much use.
Instead, any market model is like a road map. It is a deliberate simplification of a very
complicated terrain, omitting some features and thereby emphasizing others. The aim of
the model is to capture and make transparent the essential features of the interaction among
firms. In this light, to say that the real world is more complicated than the model is no
criticism. Indeed, if the modeling achieves its aim of making clear the underlying structure
and the principles governing the market outcome, then its abbreviated portrait of the real
world is its strength.

Whether or not a particular theoretical model is a good proxy for real world outcomes can
be determined by testing the predictions of the model against actual data and observational
evidence. Armed with ever-increasingly sophisticated statistical techniques, such testing has
also become an essential part of the field of modern industrial organization. Throughout this
book, you will find numerous Reality Checkpoints designed to illustrate the applicability
of the concepts in question. In addition, you will find a number of recent empirical studies
offering evidence on the validity of the various models. This combination of theory and
evidence provide a useful guide to the likely outcome of strategic interaction in a variety of
settings. In each such case studied, the basic interpretation of the model and associated data
is that “this is how to think about what happens in an imperfectly competitive market when
_. . ._ ” This is how we do industrial organization.


1.3 WHY: ANTITRUST AND INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION
THEORY


The text of the principal US antitrust statutes is given in the Appendix to this chapter.
Suffice it to say at this point that such legislation came early to the United States with the
passage of the first major antitrust law—the Sherman Act—in 1890. This predates much
of the formal modeling of imperfect competition and certainly its dissemination. However,
economists had had an intuitive grasp of the potential problems of monopoly power as far
back as Adam Smith. In his classic _The Wealth of Nations_ (1776), Smith had written on
both collusion among ostensibly rival firms and on the raw exercise of monopoly power:


People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment or diversion, but the
conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices _. . ._

The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly understocked, by never fully supplying
the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price _. . ._ .


Within the United States, a sizable popular sentiment against monopoly became clear in
the Jacksonian era. By the second half of the 19 [th] century, this sentiment had grown large
enough that political parties officially calling themselves the Anti-Monopoly Party emerged


1 Keynes (1935).


Industrial Organization: What, How, and Why 7


in many states and even formed a national party in 1884. [2] By this time, many Americans
had become convinced that a few large firms and trusts, such as Standard Oil and American
Tobacco, had exploited their market power in just the ways Smith had forecast. A consensus
emerged—one that has endured throughout the history of antitrust legislation—that some
form of legal framework was needed to maintain competition in the market place.

Thus, it was popular sentiment reinforced by shrewd Smithian insight that led to the
enactment of the first US antitrust law, the 1890 Sherman Act. Indeed, it is somewhat
remarkable just how directly the concerns of Adam Smith are reflected in the two primary
sections of the Sherman Act. Section 1 prohibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies
“in restraint of trade.” Section 2 makes illegal any attempt to monopolize a market. The
view that government institutions were necessary to achieve these aims was also later
reflected in the Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts.

Antitrust policy, in the beginning, focused primarily on prosecuting and preventing
collusive agreements to raise prices under the authority of Section 1. Early cases such
as the _Trans-Missouri Freight Association_ and the _Addyston Pipe_ case of 1897 and
1898, respectively, established this tradition. It remains a centerpiece of antitrust policy
to this day, [3] as evidenced by the successful prosecution in the past fifteen years of
agricultural products giant Archer Daniels Midland; the world’s two largest auction houses,
Sotheby’s and Christie’s, the international pharmaceutical giant Hoffman-LaRoche; the
LCD manufacturers AU Optronics, LG Display, and Samsung; and the largest publishing
houses with respect to their pricing of e-books.

However, unlike the Section 1 statute, the enforcement of Section 2 on monopolization
has been more limited. Despite wide public perception that many of the giant firms emerging
from the Industrial Revolution had abused and exploited their monopoly power, it was
twelve years before one of these, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, was prosecuted
under Section 2. [4] That case eventually led to the famous Supreme Court ruling in 1911 that
Standard Oil had illegally monopolized the petroleum refining industry. Similar findings
against other trusts, including most notably the Tobacco Trust, [5] followed quickly. Yet
unlike the price-fixing cases, these monopolization decisions were less clear about what
actions were illegal. In particular, the court established a “rule of reason” framework for
monopolization cases that permitted the courts to examine not only whether monopolization
of an industry had occurred but, if so, what the market context was surrounding the formation
of that monopoly and the business practices used to achieve it. Only if this additional inquiry
found an explicit intent to monopolize or an obvious exploitation of monopoly power was
there a true violation.

Practically speaking, the rule of reason approach meant that there was a lot of ambiguity
in exactly what actions were illegal. This had two important results. First, those who feared
that such a legal framework might weaken antitrust enforcement were motivated to pursue
additional reforms so that Section 2 of the Sherman Act would not become a “paper-toothed
tiger.” [6] This led in 1914 to the passage of the Clayton Act meant to stop monopolization

in its incipiency by limiting the use of a number of business practices such as rebates,
tying, and exclusive contracts that were used by Standard Oil in establishing its dominance.
Section 7, which was later amended in the 1950s, was passed to prevent anticompetitive
mergers.

The same fear also led to the passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914
that established an administrative agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), endowed
with powers of investigation and adjudication to handle Clayton Act violations. As later
amended, this act also outlawed “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair and deceptive
acts or practices.” Creation of the FTC gave antitrust policy a second arm of law enforcement
in addition to that provided by the Justice Department (DOJ).

The second major result stemming from adoption of a rule of reason approach emerged
later with the _U.S. Steel_ case of 1920. In that case, the Court made clear that in its view “the
law does not make mere size an offense or the existence of unexerted power an offense—it
does not compel competition nor require all that is possible.” [7] As a result, the Court found
U.S. Steel—a firm that through a series of mergers had grown to control over 70 percent of
US steel-making capacity—innocent of any antitrust violations.

The U.S. Steel decision had a major impact on both the steel industry and the US legal
framework. For our purposes, however, the reason that this case was so important is that
it served as a major intellectual stimulus to the field of industrial organization. For the
conclusion to which many analysts were led by the 1920 decision was that without a good
economic road map by which to understand imperfect competition, the making of antitrust
policy was a difficult proposition at best. It was the subsequent effort to provide the road
map that initiated the field that we now call industrial organization.

Economists such as Edward Chamberlin (1933) and Edward Mason (1939), both at
Harvard, led the way. In their view, the microeconomics of the time offered little guidance
either to policy makers or the legal system as to what evidence might be useful in determining
the likely outcome that a market would produce. The Supreme Court’s dismissal of the
government charges of monopolization in the U.S. Steel case was based on an argument
that no exploitation of monopoly power or intent to monopolize had been shown. Only U.S.
Steel’s large market share had been documented and, “ _the law does not make mere size_
_an offense_ ” [emphasis added]. Unless there was good reason to believe that a large market
share offered strong evidence of monopolization, or until there was a coherent argument
that identified other observable characteristics that in turn implied illegal behavior, the
court’s decision had a fair bit of justification.

More generally, economists at that time realized that any informed legal judgment would
require some practical way to determine from observable evidence whether the industry in
question was closer to perfect competition or closer to monopoly. Accordingly, they viewed
the highest priority of industrial economics to be the determination of whether and how
one could infer illegal behavior from either firm size or other structural features. It was to
provide this policy guide that the field of industrial organization began to emerge. The very
name of the field—industrial organization—dates from this time.

Early work therefore focused on a set of key questions: how is the production of the
industry organized? How is the market structured? How many firms are there and how large
are they relative to each other? Are there clear barriers to entry? It was recognized from

Industrial Organization: What, How, and Why 9


the outset, however, that answering these questions would not be enough to provide the
legal framework needed by legislators and courts to determine whether or not the antitrust
laws had been violated. Achieving this goal required not only that an industry’s structural
features be revealed but that clear links between structure and market outcomes also be
identified. That is, industrial economists needed to obtain data on prices, profits, and market
structure, and then use these data to identify statistical relationships between various market
structures, on the one hand, and industrial performance, on the other.

This was the agenda explicitly announced by Edward Mason who in 1939 wrote, “The
problem, as I see it, is to reduce the voluminous data concerning industrial organization
to some sort of order through a classification of market structures. Differences in market
structure are ultimately explicable in terms of technological factors. The economic problem,
however, is to explain, through an examination of the structure of markets and the
organization of firms, differences in competitive practices including price, production and
investment policies.” [8] In sum, the early industrial organization economists viewed their
goal as one of establishing links between both market structure and the conduct of firms in
the market. In turn, that conduct would determine the likely outcome or performance of the
market in terms of economic efficiency or general social welfare. For this reason, this early
approach is typically referred to as the Structure-Conduct-Performance (or SCP) approach.
Presumably, if the outcome for a particular industry given its structure was sufficiently bad,
legal action was justified either to alter the conduct that structure would otherwise generate
or, if necessary, to change the structure itself.

The basic principle behind the SCP paradigm was that perfect competition and monopoly
are usefully viewed as opposite ends of a spectrum of market structures along which all
markets lie. One natural measure of market structure is the degree of concentration, or the
percentage of market output produced by the largest firms in that industry. Accordingly, the
practice of industrial economics at that time became one of, first, accurately describing the
structure of different markets and, second, deriving empirical relations between structures
and outcomes in terms of price–cost margins, innovative efforts, and other performance
measures. Research focused on examining statistically the broad hypotheses on market
structure and performance implied by the SCP paradigm. Here, structure was often identified
with the degree of concentration or the percentage of total market output accounted for by
the few largest firms. Finding a road map for policy was interpreted to mean providing
numerical answers to questions such as how much would a bit more concentration or a bit
higher entry barriers raise price above cost.

In pursuit of the SCP quest, the 1930s and 1940s witnessed numerous studies attempting
to document and to measure the link between industrial performance, say profitability, and
an industry’s structural features, such as concentration. In some respects, this goal was
met. For example, the research appeared to establish a positive link between a measure of
industrial concentration and industry profit and a similarly positive link between advertising
and profitability. The first finding gave support to the view that an industry in which there
was more than one but still just a few large firms was indeed somewhat close to the
monopoly pole. The second finding was interpreted as evidence that firms used advertising
to build customer loyalty and, thus, to deter other firms from entering the market. In turn,
this permitted the incumbent firms to enjoy monopoly power and profit.

1.3.1 The “New” Sherman Act and the Dominance of Structure-Based
Analysis


The early findings of SCP scholars increasingly seemed to suggest that perhaps a firm’s
“mere size” _could_ imply a legal offense if it is sufficiently large. The practical question then
became whether or not these developments would influence antitrust law. This question
was answered in the affirmative with the 1945 Supreme Court case against Alcoa.

Alcoa was by far the largest aluminum manufacturer in North America. It had been
prosecuted for antitrust violations a number of times prior to the 1945 case. In fact, so large
a number of Supreme Court justices in 1945 had had previous litigation experience with
Alcoa that they could not participate in this proceeding, with the result that the Supreme
Court lacked a quorum to hear the case. For this reason, the 1945 decision was issued by
a special panel of three circuit court judges. In a key decision, this panel overturned the
finding of innocence by the lower district court and found Alcoa guilty of monopolization
under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. An explicit consideration for the Court was the issue of
size. [9] Alcoa’s market share depended critically on how one measured the market, and much
attention was given to this issue. Ultimately, the Court defined Alcoa’s relevant market to
be primary aluminum ingot production. Using this definition, the Court found that Alcoa
supplied 90 percent of the market. In effect, this decision was a major policy validation of
the SCP approach.

Other cases also reflecting a newly found concern over market domination by
large firms soon followed. In 1946, the Supreme Court found the big three tobacco
companies—American Tobacco, Ligget & Myers, and R. J. Reynolds, which controlled
75 percent of domestic cigarette production—guilty of monopolization. [10] A number of
similar cases continued over the next twenty years, culminating with such well-known ones
as the 1962 _Brown Shoe_ case and the 1964 case against the Grinnell Corporation. All of
these cases gave increasing weight to market structure as an indictment of proposed or past
actions. [11] The (in)famous price discrimination case of _Utah Pie_ (1967) may also be read as
an indictment of any outcome in which a few large firms come to dominate the market. [12]

In that case, the Court viewed the pricing strategies of the bigger nationwide companies to
be evidence of predatory intent against a smaller firm primarily because the shares of the
larger firms grew over a four-year period. In short, the period from 1945 into the late 1960s
reflects the growing dominance of the SCP framework as the major intellectual influence
on antitrust policy. [13]


1.3.2 The Tide Changes—The Chicago School and Beyond


Matters began to change in the 1970s. In part, this reflected a growing awareness among
academic scholars that the SCP paradigm had important failings. One of these was that the
vast array of empirical findings that the SCP researchers had amassed was actually subject

to different interpretations. For example, consider the frequent finding that firms with large
market shares tend to earn greater profit. This could be taken as a verification of the basic
SCP view that the larger a firm’s market share, the greater the monopoly power and the
higher its profit. However, a more benign interpretation of this evidence is also possible.
It could be that the most efficient, or the lowest cost, firm gains the largest share of the
market, so that both large size and healthy profit are simply reflections of a firm’s superior
technology or talent. [14]

What was really unsatisfactory about the SCP approach, however, was that in considering
its middle link—firm conduct—little or no attention was paid to strategic interaction. A
consideration of strategic interaction forces one to face a critical failure in the SCP paradigm.
That failure is that it treats structure as exogenous—a factor that determines firm behavior
but is not determined by it. Yet it is clear that firm conduct has important effects on market
structure. For example, intense price competition among incumbent firms may make entry
unattractive with the result that we may find industries with relatively high concentration
to be precisely the industries with competitive pricing—a result not easily squared with the
basic SCP approach.

To be sure, some of those working in the SCP tradition—notably Joe Bain
(1956)—understood this limitation. Bain, in particular, was among the first who understood
that entry considerations had to become a part of industrial economics. This important
insight played a central role in the “contestability” theory developed much later by Baumol,
Panzar, and Willig (1982). It is however a two-edged sword. The ease with which new
firms can enter is at least partially the result of actions taken by the firms already in the
market. That is, incumbent firms can pursue strategic actions meant to influence the entry
decisions of other, potential rivals. Within the SCP paradigm, one could not easily address
this issue.

The weaknesses in the SCP paradigm were accompanied by a discomfort that many
felt concerning the more aggressive antitrust enforcements mentioned above. In the _Brown_
_Shoe_ case, for example, the Court disallowed the merger of two firms (Brown and Kinney)
even though they only controlled about five percent of the national market (though a greater
percentage of individual local markets). Similarly, the _Utah Pie_ case seemed to be a decision
that did more to protect a specific competitor (Utah Pie) than to protect competitive forces.

The rising concern over flaws in both the SCP approach and the public policy it had
fostered made possible a counter movement led by lawyers and economists from the
Chicago School such as Richard Posner, Robert Bork, and Sam Peltzman. These and
other scholars began to point out that many of the practices that the courts had been
viewing as harmful to competition and economic welfare could, when viewed through the
lens of corporate strategy and tactics, be seen as actually improving economic efficiency
and benefitting consumers. This work initially focused on the vertical relationships either
between a firm and its suppliers or between a firm and its distributors. Many such vertical
contracts include restrictions such as those that grant franchisees exclusive territories,



14 As shown later, this is a standard result in a Cournot model in which costs differ across firms. Specifically,
if _P_ is market price, _η_ is the market demand elasticity at that price, and _ci_ and _si_ are the _i_ th firm’s unit cost



and market share, respectively, then it must be the case that: _[P]_ [ −] _[c][i]_

or that require distributors to sell at some minimum price. Chicago School economists
argued that there were good economic reasons for these practices and that these restrictions
actually brought benefits to consumers. Over time, these arguments were successful and
many practices that had been previously found to be _per se_ or outright illegal the court now
began to review for their “reasonability” on a case-by-case method. [15]

The Chicago School influence on vertical relationships soon spread to more of antitrust
policy. In 1974, the US Supreme Court rejected the government’s efforts to block a large
merger in a case involving the General Dynamics Corporation. [16] Many mergers that would
previously have been prevented soon followed, justified on both grounds of cost savings
and the potential for new entrants to constrain any attempt by the newly merged firm to
exercise monopoly power. The government also lost several key cases accusing large firms
such as Kodak and IBM of monopolization in violation of the Sherman Act. In addition,
the precedent of the _Utah Pie_ case was firmly rejected during these subsequent years.
It became increasingly clear—most notably in the case involving a complaint by Zenith
Corporation charging that seven Japanese television manufacturers had attempted to drive
out competitors—that in the courts’ view, efforts to eliminate rivals by pricing below cost
rarely made sense. [17]

The Chicago School’s contributions are difficult to underestimate and its legal influence
is felt to this day. These scholars were right to point out the need to examine the logic and
reasonability of a firm’s conduct. However, they were hampered by the fact that, as of that
time, no language or framework in which to view such strategic behavior on a consistent
basis had yet been developed. Yet such a framework was emerging. Building on the work
of Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) and Nash (1951), Nobel Prize laureates Reinhard
Selten, John Harsanyi, Michael Spence, and Thomas Schelling all made a number of crucial
contributions that permitted game theory to become the language for modeling strategic
interaction. As we noted earlier, the past two decades have witnessed the rapid spread of
game theory to analyze virtually every aspect of imperfect competition. As a result, the
field of industrial organization has again been transformed and now reflects, at least in part,
what some call a post-Chicago view and what others simply refer to as the “new IO.” [18]

We have already noted that there is much to be said for pursuing a game-theoretic
understanding of the strategic interaction of firms. What is important to note at this point
is that it was game theory that allowed us a way to model and analyze firm behavior
in imperfectly competitive markets. Moreover, as game theoretic analysis spread through
modern industrial organization its insights have, to some extent, led to a diminishment
of the Chicago School’s impact. However, it would be wrong to identify the advent
of game theory models and the new post-Chicago approach as a total rejection of the
Chicago School’s work. For example, the Merger Guidelines adopted jointly by the Federal
Trade Commission and the Justice Department have deep roots in the Cournot-Nash game
theoretic model that we describe more fully in Chapter 15. While these guidelines are far

from permissive, they still allow for many more mergers than would ever have legally
occurred in the “New Sherman Act” years of the 1950s and 1960s.

The major point of this brief review is that since its inception, industrial organization has
been associated with antitrust policy. More than that, however, industrial organization has
emerged as the locus of work on strategic interaction among firms. In this regard, its goal is to
understand business tactics and the market implications of corporate strategies. It therefore
provides considerable insight into business life, and to some extent this understanding has
become a goal in itself. We want to know how firms compete when they have market
power, what implication that competition has, what the role of public policy might be in
helping imperfectly competitive markets achieve outcomes closer to the competitive ideal,
and what counter-tactics firms may employ. Finding the answers to these questions is why
we study industrial organization.


1.4 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: ANTITRUST AROUND
THE GLOBE


As noted, a major motivation for the study of industrial organization on imperfect
competition is the insights that it provides for antitrust policy. Industrial organization
tools will be useful wherever antitrust is an active concern of government. To what nations
does this apply? How extensively and to what depth are antitrust laws applied around the
world?

Economist Michael Nicholson (2008) has provided some recent answers to the above
questions by creating an Antitrust Law Index measuring the extent of anti-monopoly laws
in fifty-two different countries as of 2005. For each of these countries, Nicholson (2008)
examines three broad areas of antitrust concern: 1) collusive behavior to raise prices or
otherwise restrain trade; 2) abuse of monopoly power such as below-cost pricing to drive
out competitors; and 3) mergers. To this he adds a consideration of what remedies the laws
specify and whether private parties can initiate antitrust actions. Within each of these areas,
Nicholson looks for the presence of explicit laws; the country in question receives a score
of 1 if it has such a law and 0 otherwise. For example, if a country has a law requiring
(large) firms to pre-notify the authorities that they intend to merge, one point is added to
its overall antitrust score while it gets 0 if it does not. Similarly, the presence of an explicit
law against price-fixing also results in the award of 1 point. Over all such categories, the
highest possible score is 31.

As mentioned, Nicholson (2008) constructs his Antitrust Law Index for fifty-two separate
countries. Across these countries the Index ranges in value from 4 in Malta and Chile to 21
in the United States. The median value across all countries is about 14. The full set of index
values by country is shown in Table 1.1.

Nicholson (2008) also briefly explores the source of these differences in each country.
One point that seems clear is that emerging economies often adopt extensive antitrust
laws, especially when they hope to eventually join an international trade group such as the
European Union that already has strong antitrust laws. More explicitly, Nicholson presents
evidence that the Antitrust Law Index initially falls with GNP, but ultimately rises with it.
As a result, small economies and large economies will have a higher Antitrust Law Index
than will medium-sized ones.
