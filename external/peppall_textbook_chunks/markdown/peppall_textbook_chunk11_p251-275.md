imperfect competition, a number of its predictions are borne out by empirical evidence.

It is important to remember though that, as
pointed out in Chapter 4, market structure is
endogenous. Strategies that generate above normal profits for existing firms will induce new
firms to enter. At the same time, incumbent firms
may be able to take actions that deter such entry.
We need to extend our analysis in ways that allow
us to examine these issues.


**Problems**


1. Harrison and Tyler are two students who met
by chance the last day of exams before the
end of the spring semester and the beginning of summer. Fortunately, they liked each
other very much. Unfortunately, they forgot to exchange addresses. Fortunately, each
remembers that they spoke of attending a
campus party that night. Unfortunately, there
are two such parties. One party is small. If
each attends this party, they will certainly
meet. The other party is huge. If each attends
this one, there is a chance they will not
meet because of the crowd. Of course, they
will certainly not meet if they attend separate parties. Payoffs to each depending on
the combined choice of parties are shown
below, with Tyler’s payoffs listed first.



Static Games and Cournot Competition 239


Further, the Cournot model studied in this
chapter has firms interacting only once. The reality, of course, is that firms are involved in strategic
interactions repeatedly. In such a setting, issues
such as learning, establishing a reputation, and
credibility can become quite important. We turn
to a consideration of how the nature of strategic
interaction over time affects market structure in
Chapters 11–13.


which others (no one in particular, just people
in general) are expected to come. As a result,
total attendance _A_ at the small party depends
on just how many people _X_ everyone _expects_
to show up. Let the relationship between A
and X be given by: _A_ = 20 + 0.6 _X_
a. Explain this equation. Why is the intercept 20? Why is the relation between A
and X positive?
b. If the equilibrium requires that partygoers’ expectations be correct, what is the
equilibrium attendance at the Outcasts’
party?


3. A game known well to both academics and
teenage boys is “Chicken.” Two players each
drive their car down the center of a road
in opposite directions. Each chooses either
STAY or SWERVE. Staying wins adolescent admiration and a big payoff _if_ the other
player chooses SWERVE. Swerving loses
face and has a low payoff when the other
player stays. Bad as that is, it is still better
than the payoff when both players choose
STAY in which case they each are badly
hurt. These outcomes are described below
with Player A’s payoffs listed first.

|Col1|Col2|Player B|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|||Stay|Swerve|
|_Player A_|Stay|_(_−6_,_ −6_)_|_(_2_,_ −2_)_|
|_Player A_|Swerve|<br>_(_−2_,_ 2_)_|<br>(1, 1)|



a. Find the Nash equilibria in this game.
b. This is a good game to introduce mixed
strategies. If Player A adopts the strategy STAY one-fifth of the time, and
SWERVE four-fifths of the time, show





|Col1|Col2|Harrison|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|

|_Tyler_|Go to<br>Small Party|(1,000, 1,000)|(0, 0)|
|_Tyler_|Go to<br>Large Party|(0, 0)|(500, 500)|


a. Identify the Nash equilibria for this
problem.
b. Identify the Pareto optimal outcome for
this “two party” system.



2. Suppose that the small party of Problem 1
is hosted by the “Outcasts,” twenty men and
women students trying to organize alternatives to the existing campus party establishment. All twenty Outcasts will attend the
party. But many other students—not unlike
Harrison and Tyler—only go to a party to

that Player B will then be indifferent between either strategy, STAY or
SWERVE.
c. If _both_ players use this probability mix,
what is the chance that they will both be
badly hurt?


4. You are a manager of a small “widget”producing firm. There are only two firms,
including yours, that produce “widgets.”
Moreover your company and your competitor’s are identical. You produce the same
good and face the same costs of production
described by the following total cost function: Total Cost = 1500 + 8 _q_ where _q_ is the
output of an individual firm. The marketclearing price, at which you can sell your
widgets to the public, depends on how many
widgets both you and your rival choose
to produce. A market research company
has found that market demand for widgets
can be described as: _P_ = 200 − 2 _Q_ where
_qQ_ 2 = is your rivals. The Board of Directors _q_ 1 + _q_ 2, where _q_ 1 is your output and
has directed you to choose an output level
that will _maximize_ the firm’s profit. How
many widgets should your firm produce in
order to achieve the profit-maximizing goal?
Moreover you must present your strategy to
the Board of Directors and explain to them
why producing this amount of widgets is the
profit-maximizing strategy.


5. You are still a manager of a small widgetproducing firm. Now however there are
fourteen such firms (including yours) in
the industry. Each firm is identical; each
one produces the same product and has
the same costs of production. Your firm,
as well as each one of the other firms,
has the same total cost function, namely:
Total Cost = 200 + 50 _q_ where q is the output of an individual firm. The price at which
you can sell your widgets is determined by
market demand, which has been estimated as:



_P_ 290
= - 3 [1]



_P_ 290
= - 3 _[Q]_ [ where] _[ Q]_ [ is the sum of all the]

individual firms producing in this industry.
So, for example, if 120 widgets are produced
in the industry then the market-clearing price
will be 250, whereas if 300 widgets are produced then the market-clearing price will be
190. The Board of Directors has directed you
to choose an output level that maximizes the



firm’s profit. You have an incentive to maximize profits because your job and salary
depend upon the profit performance of this
company. Moreover you should also be able
to present your profit-maximizing strategy to
the Board of Directors and explain to them
why producing this amount maximizes the
firm’s profit.


6. The inverse market demand for fax paper
is given by _P_ = 400 − 2 _Q_ . There are two
firms who produce fax paper. Each firm has
a unit cost of production equal to 40, and
they compete in the market in quantities.
That is, they can choose any quantity to produce, and they make their quantity choices
simultaneously.
a. Show how to derive the Cournot-Nash
equilibrium to this game. What are firms’
profits in equilibrium?
b. What is the monopoly output, i.e.,
the one that maximizes total industry
profit? Why isn’t producing one-half
the monopoly output a Nash equilibrium
outcome?


7. Return to Problem 6, but suppose now that
firm 1 has a cost advantage. Its unit cost is
constant and equal to 25 whereas firm 2 still
has a unit cost of 40. What is the Cournot
outcome now? What are the profits for each
firm?


8. We can use the Cournot model to derive an
equilibrium industry structure. For this purpose, we will define an equilibrium as that
structure in which no firm has an incentive
to leave or enter the industry. If a firm leaves
the industry, it enters an alternative competitive market in which case it earns zero
(economic) profit. If an additional firm enters
the industry when there are already _n_ firms in
it, the new firm’s profit is determined by the
Cournot equilibrium with _n_ + 1 firms. For
this problem, assume that each firm has the
cost function: _C(q)_ = 256 + 20 _q_ . Assume
further that market demand is described by:
_P_ = 100 − _Q_ .
a. Find the long-run equilibrium number of
firms in this industry.
b. What industry output, price, and firm
profit levels will characterize the longrun equilibrium?

# **10** **Oligopolistic Price Competition**

In 2007, Amazon introduced its first _Kindle_ e-reader at a price of $399. The product was a
quick success. However, in the face of an announcement by Barnes & Noble that it would
soon launch its own _Nook_ e-reader, the price was reduced in 2008 to $259. In 2009, when
the _Nook_ was launched, the competition intensified and Amazon dropped the price to $199.
In March of 2010, Apple began taking orders for its new _iPad_ product, which also included
e-reading capabilities. As this text is being written, both the _Kindle Touch_ and the _Nook_
_Simple Touch_ are selling for $99 _,_ while the latest top-of-the-line _Kindle Fire_ that also
serves as a viewer and game platform is being offered at a sale price of $139. This rapid fall
of e-reader prices has been all the more remarkable in that it has been accompanied by an
almost equally rapid rise in their quality. Relative to the initial products, the current _Kindle_
and _Nook_ are more than 50 percent lighter, have a battery life more than twice as long, and
a storage capacity as much as 100 times greater.

The digital and mobile technology markets are similar to many markets, including
restaurants, electricians, moving companies, consulting firms, and financial services, in
which consumers favor those products that best match their preferences at the lowest price.
In these markets, it is in fact the firm’s price choice that largely determines its demand and
its profit, and each firm may set a different price. While this may seem eminently plausible,
it is quite different from the way competition works in the Cournot model. There each firm
independently chooses a level of production. It is only afterwards that the market price
adjusts so that consumers will buy the combined output of all the firms at a price that is the
same for each company.

In a monopolized market, it would of course make no difference whether the firm initially
set a price and then produced whatever amount consumers demanded at that price or,
instead, first chose its production and let the price settle at whatever level was necessary
to sell that output. When a profit-maximizing monopolist optimally sets price, that choice
will imply, via the demand curve, a specific output level. That same optimal price is
precisely the price that would have emerged if instead the monopolist had initially chosen
its profit-maximizing production.

Once we leave the world of monopoly, however, the equivalence of price and output
strategies vanishes. In oligopolistic markets, it matters very much whether firms compete in
terms of quantities, as in Cournot, or in prices like the e-reader firms above. To understand
these differences, we begin as we did with the Cournot model by examining the simple
duopoly case in which the two firms sell an identical good but now compete by first setting


Oligopolistic Price Competition 243


prices instead of production levels. This is known as the Bertrand model. Later in the
chapter we allow the products to be less than perfect substitutes, or to be differentiated. As
in Chapter 9, we also focus on static or simultaneous models of price competition limited
to a single market period.


10.1 THE BERTRAND DUOPOLY MODEL


The standard duopoly model, recast in terms of price strategies rather than quantity
strategies, is typically referred to as the Bertrand model. Joseph Bertrand was a French
mathematician who in 1883 reviewed and critiqued Cournot’s work nearly fifty years
after its publication in the _Journal des Savants_ . Bertrand was critical of mathematical
modeling in economics, and to prove his point he analyzed the Cournot model in terms
of prices rather than quantities. The legacy of Bertrand is not, however, his criticism of
what he termed “pseudo-mathematics” in economics. Instead, Bertrand’s contribution was
the recognition that outcome of the strategic interaction depends critically on the nature
of the strategic variable—in this case, quantity versus price. This is just a way of expressing
the point made at the start of the previous chapter. The rules of the game matter _. . ._ a lot.

Therefore, consider the simple duopoly model of Chapter 9, but now let each firm choose
the price it will charge rather than the quantity it will produce. All other assumptions,
however, remain unchanged. Each firm produces the same good at the same constant
marginal cost _c_, and the firms choose their strategies simultaneously. Each firm knows the
structure of market demand and its rival’s cost, as well as the fact that total demand is:
_P_ = _A_ - _BQ_ . In this case, it is more convenient to write the demand function with output
as the dependent variable. [1] Hence:




_[A]_ and _b_ [1]

_B_ = _B_



_Q_ _a_ _bP_ where _a_ _[A]_
= - ; = _B_



(10.1)
_B_



Consider the pricing problem first from firm 2’s perspective. In order to determine its best
price response to its rival, firm 2 must first work out the demand for its product _conditional_
on both its own price, denoted by _p_ 2 _,_ and firm 1’s price, denoted by _p_ 1. Rationally speaking,
firm 2’s reasoning would go as follows. If _p_ 2 _> p_ 1 _,_ firm 2 will sell no output. The product is
homogenous so that consumers always buy from the cheapest source. Setting a price above
that of firm 1 therefore means that firm 2 will serve no customers. The opposite is true if
_p_ 2 _< p_ 1. When firm 2 sets the lower price, it will supply the entire market, and firm 1will
sell nothing. Finally, if _p_ 2 _p_ 1 _,_ the two firms will split the market evenly. When both firms
charge identical prices, we will assume that each firm’s demand is one half the total market =
demand at that price.

The foregoing reasoning tells us that demand for firm 2’s output, _q_ 2 _,_ may be described
as follows:



_q_ 2 = _0_ _if p_ 2 _> p_ 1



_q_ 2 = _[a]_ [ −] 2 _[bp]_ [2]



2 _if p_ 2 = _p_ 1 (10.2)



_q_ 2 = _a_  - _bp_ 2 _if p_ 2 _< p_ 1

1 When firms choose quantities (as in Cournot’s model) it is often easier to work with the inverse demand
curve and treat price as the dependent variable. When firms select prices, as in Bertrand’s analysis, it is
often best to let quantity be the dependent variable.

As Figure 10.1 shows, this demand function is _not_ continuous. For any _p_ 2 greater than
_p_ 1 _,_ demand for _q_ 2 is zero. But when _p_ 2 falls and becomes exactly equal to _p_ 1 _,_ demand



jumps from zero to _[a]_ [ −] _[bp]_ [2]



jumps from zero to . When _p_ 2 then falls still further so that it is below _p_ 1, demand

2
then jumps again to _a_ _bp_ 2.
        
This discontinuity in firm 2’s demand curve was not present in the Cournot model
of quantity competition, and it turns out to make a crucial difference in terms of firms’
strategies. The discontinuity in demand carries over into a discontinuity in profits. Firm 2’s
profit, _�_ 2, as a function of _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 is:




_�_ 2 _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ = 0 _if p_ 2 _> p_ 1




_�_ 2 _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ = _(p_ 2 − _c)_ _[a]_ [ −] 2 _[bp]_ [2]



2 _if p_ 2 = _p_ 1 (10.3)




_�_ 2 _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ = _(p_ 2 − _c)(a_ - _bp_ 2 _)_ _if p_ 2 _< p_ 1



To find firm 2’s _best response_ function, we need to find the price _p_ 2 that maximizes
firm 2’s profits _�_ 2 _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ for any given choice of _p_ 1. For example, suppose firm 1
chooses a very high price—higher even than the pure monopoly price, which in this case is



_p_ _[M]_ _[a]_ [ +] _[ bc]_
= 2 _b_



. [2] Because firm 2 could capture the entire market by selecting any price lower
2 _b_



than _p_ 1 _,_ its best response would be to choose the pure monopoly price _p_ _[M]_ _,_ and thereby
earn the pure monopoly profits.

Conversely, what if firm 1 set a very low price, say one below its unit cost _c_ ? This would
be an unusual choice, but if we wish to construct a complete _best response_ function for
firm 2, we must determine its value for _all_ the possible values _p_ 1 can take. If _p_ 1 _< c,_ then
firm 2 is best setting its price a level above _p_ 1. This will mean that firm 2 will sell nothing


2 This is, of course, the same monopoly price as we showed in Chapter 8 for the quantity version of the
model with the notational change that _a_ = _A/B,_ and _b_ = 1 _/B_ .

Firm 2’s profits rise continuously as its price rises from the level of marginal cost, c, to just below firm 1’s price.
When _p_ 2 equals _p_ 1 _,_ firm 2’s profits fall relative to those earned when _p_ 2 is just below _p_ 1. For _p_ 2 greater than
_p_ 1 _,_ firm 2 earns zero profits.


firm 2 sells a positive amount of output, but at a price below unit cost so that it loses moneyand earn zero profits. The alternative of setting _p_ 2 ≤ _p_ 1 _< c_ will lead to _negative_ profits:
on each unit sold.

What about the more likely case in which firm 1 sets its price above marginal cost _c_ but
either equal to or below the pure monopoly price _p_ _[M]_ ? How should firm 2 optimally respond
in these circumstances? The simple answer is that it should set a price _just a bit less than p_ 1.
The intuition behind this strategy is illustrated in Figure 10.2, which shows firm 2’s profit



given a price _p_ 1 _,_ satisfying the relationship _[a]_ [ +] _[ bc]_



given a price _p_ 1 _,_ satisfying the relationship _p_ 1 _> c_ .

2 _b_ ≥
Note that firm 2’s profits rise continuously as _p_ 2 rises from _c_ to just below _p_ 1. Whenever
_p_ 2 is less than _p_ 1,, firm 2 is the only company that sells anything. However, when _p_ 1 is
less than or equal to _p_ _[M]_, the monopoly power that firm 2 obtains from undercutting _p_ 1 is
constrained. In particular, the firm cannot sell at the pure monopoly price, _p_ _[M]_, and earn the
associated profit because at that price, firm 2 would lose all its customers. Still, the firm will
wish to get as close to that result as possible. It could, of course, just match firm 1’s price
exactly. But whenever it does so, it shares the market equally with its rival. If, instead, firm
2 just _slightly_ reduces its price below _p_ 1 level, it will double its sales while incurring only an
infinitesimal decline in its profit margin per unit sold. This is a trade well worth the making,
as Figure 10.2 makes clear. In turn, the implication is that for any _p_ 1 such that _p_ _[M]_ ≥ _p_ 1 _> c_,
firm 2’s best response is to set _p_ 2 [∗] 1

_[ p]_ _[ε]_ [, where] _[ ε]_ [ is an arbitrarily small amount.]



firm 2’s best response is to set _p_ 2 [∗] 1

The last case to consider is the case in which firm 1 prices at cost so that [=] _[ p]_ [−] _[ε]_ [, where] _[ ε]_ [ is an arbitrarily small amount.] _p_ 1 _c_ . Clearly,
firm 2 has no incentive to undercut this value of _p_ 1. To do so would only lead to losses for =
firm 2. Instead, firm 2 will do best to set _p_ 2 either equal to or above _p_ 1. If it prices above
_p_ 1, firm 2 will sell nothing and earn zero profits. If it matches _p_ 1, it will enjoy positive
sales but break even on every unit sold. Accordingly, firm 2 will earn zero profits in this
equal tolatter case, too. Thus, when _p_ 1. _p_ 1 = _c_, firm 2’s _best response_ is to set _p_ 2 either greater than or

by:



1 [∗] _[a]_ [ +] _[ bc]_

We may now determine the Nash equilibrium for the duopoly game when played in prices.
We know that a Nash equilibrium is one in which neither firm has an incentive to change its

= 2 _b_




_[ bc]_ _, p_ 2 _[a]_ [ +] _[ bc]_

strategy. For example, the strategy combination



_ε_
2 _b_ 


_cannot_



be an equilibrium. This is because in that combination, firm 2 undercuts firm 1’s price and
sells at a price just below the monopoly level. However, in such a case, firm 1 would have
no customers and earn zero profit. Because firm 1 could earn a substantial profit by lowering
its price to just below that set by firm 2, it would wish to do so. Accordingly, this strategy
cannot be a Nash equilibrium. To put it another way, firm 2 could never expect firm 1 to set
the monopoly price of _p_ 1 _(a_ _c)/_ 2 _b_ precisely because firm 1 would know that so doing
would lead to zero profit as firm 2 would undercut that price by a small amount = + _ε_ and steal
all of firm 1’s customers.

As it turns out, there is one and only one Nash equilibrium for the Bertrand duopoly
game described above. It is the price pair, _(p_ 1 [∗] 2

expectation that firm 2 will do so, and if firm 2 acts in precisely the same manner, neither [=] _[ c, p]_ [∗] [=] _[ c)]_ [.][3][ If firm 1 sets this price in the]
will have an incentive to change. Hence, the outcome of the Bertrand duopoly game is that
the market price equals marginal cost. This is, of course, exactly what occurs under perfect
competition. The only difference is that here, instead of many small firms, we have just two
firms, each of which is large relative to the market.

It is no wonder that Bertrand made note of the different outcome obtained when price
replaces quantity as the strategic variable. Far from being a cosmetic or minor change, this
alternative specification has a dramatic impact. It is useful, therefore, to explore the nature
and the source of this powerful effect more closely.

10.2 BERTRAND RECONSIDERED


Like its Cournot cousin, the Bertrand analysis of a duopoly market is not without its
critics. One chief source of criticism with the Bertrand model is its assumption that _any_
price deviation between the two firms leads to an immediate and complete loss of demand
for the firm charging the higher price. It is, of course, this assumption that gives rise to
the discontinuity in both firms’ demand and profit functions. It is also this assumption
that underlies our derivation of each firm’s best response function and their intersection
at _P_ = _MC_ .

There are two very sound reasons that a firm’s decision to charge a price higher than its
rival may not result in the complete loss of all its customers. One reason is that typically the
rival firm does not have the capacity to serve all of the customers who demand the product
or service at its low price. [4] The second is that consumers may not view the two products as
perfect substitutes.

To see the importance of capacity constraints, consider the fictional case of a small
New England area with two ski resorts, Pepall Ridge and Snow Richards, each located on
different sides of Mount Norman. Skiers regard the services at these resorts to be the same
and will choose when possible to ski at the resort that quotes the lowest lift ticket price.
Pepall Ridge and Snow Richards are roughly the same size and each can handle 1,800
skiers a day. We will further assume that the overall demand for skiing at Mount Norman
is: _Q_ = 6000 − 60 _P_, where _P_ is the price of a daily lift ticket and _Q_ is number of skiers
per day.

The two resorts compete in price. Suppose that the marginal cost of providing lift services
is the same at each resort and is equal to $10 per skier. However, the outcome in which each
resort sets a price equal to marginal cost _cannot_ be a Nash equilibrium. Demand when the
price of a lift ticket is equal to $10 would be equal to 5,400 skiers, far exceeding the total
capacity of the two resorts. To be sure, if each resort had understood the extent of demand,
each might have built additional lifts, ski runs, and parking facilities in order to increase
capacity. Nevertheless, it is still not likely that the Nash equilibrium will end up with each
resort charging a lift ticket price equal to the marginal cost of $10 per skier. Why? Think of
it this way. If Pepall Ridge sets a price of $11, Snow Richards will only find it profitable to
undercut this price—say, charge $10.90 for a lift ticket—if it can serve all the skiers who
would come at this lower price. Yet because total demand at _P_ = $10.90 is _Q_ = 5346 it
clearly cannot do so with its current capacity of 1,800.


4 Edgeworth (1925) was one of the first economists to investigate the impact of capacity constraints on
Bertrand analysis.




248 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


We might then ask how each resort ended up with a capacity of just 1,800. Wouldn’t it
have been profitable for each to expand their capacity precisely because this would then
enable either to undercut the other’s price and gain more profit? The answer to this question,
however, is no. Consider an initial capacity choice by each firm of 5,400. Clearly, such a
choice is required for each firm to make a credible threat of cutting its price to $10. Yet if
each firm did cut its price to this marginal cost, each would only serve half the market, i.e.,
2,700 skiers per day. Given that building capacity is expensive, neither firm will choose an
initial capacity of 5,400 because this would imply an equilibrium in which each firm sets a
price equal to marginal cost = $10 and in which each would serve only 2,700 skiers and
have an equal amount of costly but unused capacity.

We can see then that when capacity constraints are binding, a firm charging a higher
price than its rival only loses all its customers if its rival has the capacity to serve them.
We can also see that such a capacity choice for both firms is not likely in the range
of _P_ = marginal cost = $10. Hence, once capacity constraints are considered, Bertrand’s
proposed solution that _p_ 1 _p_ 2 marginal cost is no longer a Nash equilibrium. This
leaves open, though, the question of precisely what capacity choice for each firm does make = =
sense, i.e., what is the Nash equilibrium capacity choice?

When capacity constraints come into play, the game between the two firms really becomes
a two-stage one. In the first stage, the two firms choose capacity levels. In the second, they
compete in price. Viewed in this light, it is straightforward to show that the outcome is
likely to be close to the Cournot solution despite the fact that competition is in prices as
Bertrand proposed. [5] To see this point more clearly, let’s return to the ski resort competition
between Pepall Ridge and Snow Richards. We assume that at any price at which a resort has
demand beyond its maximum capacity, the skiers that the resort serves are those skiers who
are the most eager and who have the highest willingness to pay. [6] Suppose, for instance, that
each resort sets a lift price of $30. Then total market demand is 4,200, well beyond the total
capacity of 3,600 across both firms. Therefore, each resort will need somehow to ration
or choose which skiers will actually ski. Our assumption, sometimes called the efficient
rationing assumption, is that the resorts will do this by serving customers in order of their
willingness to pay. Pepall Ridge, for example, will serve the 1,800 potential skiers with the
1,800 highest willingesses to pay. In turn, the assumption of efficient rationing allows us to
derive the residual demand curve facing Snow Richards at any price.

A price of particular interest is $40. Suppose then that both resorts have set _p_ 1 _p_ 2
$40. At these prices, total demand is equal to 3,600, which is just equal to the total capacity = =
of the two resorts. Is this a Nash equilibrium? We can answer this question by using the
logic above to determine the demand function facing Snow Richards when Pepall Ridge
sets a price equal to $40. Under our assumption of efficient rationing, this is shown in
Figure 10.3. It is the original demand curve shifted to the left by 1,800 units, i.e. it is
_Q_ = 4200 − 60 _P_ (or, in inverse form, _P_ = 70 − _Q/_ 60). The associated marginal revenue
curve— _MR_ = 70 − _Q/_ 30—is also shown.

Note though that while changes in its price also change its quantity demanded, Snow
Richards is always constrained to serve no more than its capacity of 1,800. This is why
Figure 10.3 shows the residual demand and marginal revenue curves truncated at that output
level. More importantly, note that when Pepall Ridge sets a price of $40, Snow Richards


5 This result is formally modeled in a two-stage game in Kreps and Scheinkman (1983).
6 We also implicitly assume that in the first stage, installing capacity of any amount is costless but that, once
installed, that capacity cannot be expanded in the second stage.

Quantity 1800


**Figure 10.3** Snow Richards residual demand curve


finds that _MR_ = _MC_ at an output exactly equal to its capacity of 1,800, implying that this
is indeed the best response for Snow Richards. It also implies a price of $40 for this resort
as well. In turn, both firms charging a price of $40 also leads to the full utilization of the
1,800 skiers per day capacity at Pepall Ridge. There can be no doubt then that price = $40
for both firms is a Nash equilibrium if both choose capacity of 1,800. But is this the right
capacity level? Given Pepall Ridge’s choice, would Snow Richards have preferred to have
a greater or lesser capacity?

Suppose for instance that Snow Richards initially chose a capacity of 1,700 while, as
noted, Pepall Ridge had chosen 1,800. In this case, $40 could no longer be the price at
both firms because then the total demand (3,600) would exceed the total capacity (3,500).
What would the new price equilibrium be? Start by noting what happens if the price set by
both firms is $41.67, i.e., the price point at which total demand would equal the capacity
of 3,500. If each firm charges $41.67 per lift ticket, Pepall Ridge will serve 1,800 skiers
per day, Snow Richards will serve 1,700, and the market will clear. If just one firm raises
its price, it loses no customers to its rival (which is working at capacity) but it does lose
marginal consumers who are not willing to pay any more for a lift ticket. That is, for each
firm, we can again work out the residual demand curve and associated marginal revenue
curve given the price and capacity choice of its rival. These are:



Snow Richards —Residual Demand : _P_ = 70 − _Q/_ 60



—Residual Marginal Revenue : _MR_ = 70 − _Q/_ 30



Pepall Ridge —Residual Demand : _P_ = 71.67 − _Q/_ 60



—Residual Marginal Revenue : _MR_ = 71.67 − _Q/_ 30



Profit maximization implies that each firm will want to expand its output and lower its
price so long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost and so long as there is spare
capacity. It is straightforward to show, though, that at the capacity limit of each firm (1,700
and 1,800, respectively), the marginal revenue for each firm exceeds or equals its marginal
cost so that each will want to produce at least to capacity. To put it another way, with each
firm setting a price of $41.67 and each working to capacity, neither will want to raise its
price because to do so would lose more in revenue than it would save in costs. Of course,


250 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


neither firm wants to lower the price either because they are both working at capacity and
cannot serve any additional customers. Thus, if Snow Richards chooses instead the lower
capacity of 1,700 in response to a Pepall Ridge capacity choice of 1,800, each firm charging
$41.67 per lift ticket will indeed be the Nash equilibrium in prices. From the perspective
of Snow Richards, however, this Nash equilibrium is not as profitable as the equilibrium
that we earlier derived when Snow Richards responds to Pepall Ridge’s capacity choice of
1,800 by selecting 1,800 for its capacity as well. As can be readily verified, Snow Richards
earns $53,833.33 when it sets capacity at 1,700 but $54,000 when it sets it at 1,800. In
short, if Pepall Ridge has a capacity of 1,800, Snow Richards will not want any less.

It will also not want any more. Suppose, for example, that Snow Richards had a 1,900
skier capacity. In this case, at least one firm would need to lower its price to $38.33 in
order to clear the market. Pepall Ridge, though, has no interest in making such a price cut.
If it keeps its price at $40, it will serve its capacity of 1,800 skiers regardless of the Snow
Richards price because that firm can only serve 1,900 skiers. Thus, there is no reason for
Pepall Ridge to cut its price if Snow Richards expands its capacity by 100 units. This means
that Snow Richards faces exactly the same situation as in the original Nash equilibrium,
except that now its residual marginal revenue curve, _MR_ = 70 − _Q/_ 30, extends to an output
of 1,900 before it is truncated. Yet that marginal revenue falls below the marginal cost of
$10 as soon as the firm’s output exceeds 1,800 units. If Snow Richards had the additional
capacity, it would not want to use it. Hence, there is no point in installing the extra 100
units of capacity in the first place.

Obviously, the foregoing argument is symmetric so that just as Snow Richards wants
neither to expand nor contract its capacity from 1,800, neither does Pepall Ridge. It follows
that each firm choosing a capacity of 1,800 and setting a price of $40 is the Nash equilibrium
for this price competition game. More importantly, this outcome is exactly the same as the
Cournot outcome in a market without capacity constraints but in which each firm has a
constant marginal cost of 10 and market demand is described by _Q_ = 6000 − 60 _P_ . That
is, once capacity constraints are considered and assuming efficient rationing, Bertrand price
competition yields Cournot quantity competition outcomes. This is in fact a fairly general
result, again, conditional on the key assumptions. Of course, in reality, capacity may be more
expandable than assumed here and rationing may not be efficient. Nevertheless, the analysis
provides a strong counter argument to the dramatic marginal-cost pricing implication of the
simple Bertrand model.


because of environmental regulations neither Pepall Ridge nor Snow Richards can increase
their capacities and serve more skiers beyond their current level of 1,800. What is the Nash
equilibrium price outcome for this case?


10.3 BERTRAND IN A SPATIAL SETTING


There is a second reason that the simple Bertrand efficient outcome of price equal to
marginal cost may not occur. This is that the two firms often do not, as Bertrand assumed,
produce identical products. Think of hair salons, for example. No two hair stylists cut
and style hair in exactly the same way. Nor will the salons have exactly the same sort of


Oligopolistic Price Competition 251


equipment or furnishings. Also, as long as the two firms are not side by side, they will
differ in their locations. This is often sufficient by itself to generate a preference by some
consumers for one salon or the other even when different prices are charged. In short,
differences in locations, furnishings, or cutting styles can each be sufficient to permit one
salon to price somewhat higher than its rival without immediately losing all of its customers.

We presented a spatial model of product differentiation in Chapter 7. There our aim
was to understand the use of such differentiation by a monopoly firm to extract additional
surplus from its customers. The same model, however, may also be used to understand
the nature of price competition when competing firms market differentiated products. Let’s
review the basic setup presented earlier. There is a line of unit length (say one mile) along
which consumers are uniformly distributed. This market is supplied by two stores. This
time though, the same company does not operate the two stores. Rival firms operate them.
One firm—located at the west end of town—has the address _x_ = 0. The other—located at
the east end of town—has the location, _x_ = 1. Each of the firms has the same constant unit
cost of production _c_ .

We define a consumer’s “location” in this market to be that consumer’s most preferred
product, or style. Thus “consumer _x_ ” is located distance _x_ from the left-hand end of the
market, where distance may be geographic in a spatial model or measured in terms of
characteristics in a more general product differentiation sense. While consumers differ
regarding which variant or location of the good they consider to be the best, they are
identical in their reservation price _V_ for their most preferred product. We further assume
that the reservation price _V_ is substantially greater than the unit cost of production _c_ . Each
consumer buys at most one unit of the product. If consumer _x_ purchases a good that is
not an ideal product, the consumer incurs a utility loss. Specifically, consumer _x_ incurs the
cost _tx_ if good 1 (located at _x_ = 0) is consumed, and the cost _t(_ 1 − _x)_ if good 2 (located
at _x_ 1) is consumed. If the consumer buys good 1 at price _p_ 1, the consumer enjoys
=
surplus ofconsumer surplus _V_ _p_ 2 _V_ - _t(p_ 1 1 − _x_ 2 _tx)_ ; if good 2 at price. Of course, the consumer will purchase the good that offers _p_ 2 is purchased, there will be a consumer
the greater consumer surplus provided that this is greater than zero. Figure 10.4 describes − - this market setting.

It bears reemphasizing that the concept of location that we have introduced here serves
as a metaphor for all manner of qualitative differences between products. Instead of having
two stores geographically separated, we can think of two products marketed by two different
firms that are differentiated by some characteristic, such as sugar content in the case of soft
drinks, fat content in the case of fast food, or fuel efficiency in the case of automobiles. Our
unit line in each case represents the spectrum of products differentiated by this characteristic
and each consumer has a most preferred product specification on this line. For the case of
soft drinks our two firms could be Pepsi and Coca-Cola. In the case of fast food, our two
firms could be McDonald’s and Burger King, whereas for automobiles, our two firms could
be Ford and GM.

As in the simple Bertrand model, the two firms compete for customers by setting prices
_p_ 1 and _p_ 2, respectively. These are chosen simultaneously, and we want to solve for a Nash


_x_
Firm 1 Firm 2


**Figure 10.4** The “main street” spatial model once again


252 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


equilibrium solution to the game. If _V > c_ then in equilibrium it must be the case that both
firms have a positive market share. Because any equilibrium will require that firms charge at
least _c_ per unit and because customers always prefer the closer shop at any common price,
there is no way that either firm can steal all the customers from its rival. Here, we assume
not only that _V > c_, but also that _V_ is sufficiently large that the entire market is served.
That is, the market outcome is such that every consumer buys one unit of the product from
either firm 1 or firm 2. [7] When _V_ is large, each customer can be charged a price sufficiently
high to make each such sale profitable.

When the entire market is served, then it must be the case that there is some consumer,
called the marginal consumer _x_ _[m]_, who is indifferent between buying from either firm 1 or
firm 2. That is, this consumer enjoys the same consumer surplus either way. Algebraically,
this means that for consumer _x_ _[m]_ :


_V_ _p_ 1 _tx_ _[m]_ _V_ _p_ 2 _t(_ 1 _x_ _[m]_ _)_ (10.6)
  -  - =  -  -  
Equation 10.6 may be solved to find the address or the location of the marginal consumer,
_x_ _[m]_ . This is:


_x_ _[m]_ _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _[(p]_ [2][ −] _[p]_ [1][ +] _[ t)]_ (10.7)
= 2 _t_


At any set of prices _p_ 1 and _p_ 2, all consumers to the left of _x_ _[m]_ buy from firm 1. All those
to the right of _x_ _[m]_ buy from firm 2. In other words, _x_ _[m]_ is the fraction of the market that
buys from firm 1 and _(_ 1 − _x_ _[m]_ _)_ is the fraction that buys from firm 2. If the total number
of consumers is _N_ and they are uniformly distributed over the market space, the demand
function facing firm 1 at any price combination ( _p_ 1, _p_ 2) in which the entire market is
served is: [8]


_D_ [1] _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _x_ _[m]_ _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _[(p]_ [2][ −] _[p]_ [1][ +] _[ t)]_ _N_ (10.8)
= = 2 _t_


Similarly, firm 2’s demand function is:


_D_ [2] _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _(_ 1 _x_ _[m]_ _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _))_ _[(p]_ [1][ −] _[p]_ [2][ +] _[ t)]_ _N_ (10.9)
=      - = 2 _t_


These demand functions make sense in that each firm’s demand is decreasing in its own
price but increasing in its competitor’s price. Notice also that, unlike the simple Bertrand
duopoly model in Section 10.1, the demand function facing either firm here is continuous
in both _p_ 1 and _p_ 2. This is because when goods are differentiated, a decision by say firm
1 to set _p_ 1 a little higher than its rival’s price _p_ 2 does not cause firm 1 to lose all of its
customers. Some of its customers still prefer to buy good 1 even at the higher price simply
because they prefer that version of the good to the style (or location) marketed by firm 2. [9]


7 Refer to Figure 7.3 in Chapter 7 for a discussion of this point.
8 We are using _N_ here to refer to the _number of consumers_ in the market.
9 Our assumption that the equilibrium is one in which the entire market is served is critical to the continuity
result.


Oligopolistic Price Competition 253


The continuity in demand functions carries over into the profit functions. Firm 1’s profit
function is:

_�_ [1] _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _(p_ 1 _c)_ _[(p]_ [2][ −] _[p]_ [1][ +] _[ t)]_ _N_ (10.10)
=      - 2 _t_


Similarly, firm 2’s profits are given by:


_�_ [2] _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _(p_ 2 _c)_ _[(p]_ [1][ −] _[p]_ [2][ +] _[ t)]_ _N_ (10.11)
=      - 2 _t_



In order to work out firm 1’s best response pricing strategy we need to work out how firm
1’s profit changes as the firm varies price _p_ 1 in response to a given price _p_ 2 set by firm 2.
The most straightforward way to do this is to take the derivative of the profit function
(10.10) with respect to _p_ 1. When we set the derivative equal to zero we can then solve for
the firm’s best response price _p_ 1 [∗] [to a given price] _[ p]_ 2 [set by firm 2.][10]

However, careful application of the alternative solution method of converting firm 1’s
demand curve into its inverse form and solving for the point at which marginal revenue
equals marginal cost will also work. From (10.7), we can write firm 1’s inverse demand

curve for a given value of firm 2’s price _p_ 2 as _p_ 1 _p_ 2 _t_

its marginal cost gives the first-order condition for profit maximization, _p_ 2 _t_

its marginal cost gives the first-order condition for profit maximization, _p_ 2 _t_
+                             - _N_ _[q]_ [1][ =] _[ c]_ [.]

Solving for the optimal value of firm 1’s output, again given the price chosen by firm 2, we
then obtain:



1 [∗] _[N]_

[=] 4 _t_



_q_ 1 [∗]



(10.12)
4 _t_ _[(p]_ [2][ +] _[ t]_ [ −] _[c)]_



When we substitute the value of _q_ 1 [∗] [from equation (10.12) into firm 1’s inverse demand]

curve, we find the optimal price for firm 1 to set given the value of the price set by firm 2.
This is by definition firm 1’s best response function:



1 [∗] [=] _[p]_ [2][ +] 2 _[ c]_ [ +] _[ t]_



_p_ 1 [∗]



(10.13)

where _t_ is the per unit distance transportation or utility cost incurred by a consumer. Of
course, we can replicate this procedure for firm 2. Because the firms are symmetric, the best
response function of each firm is the mirror image of that of its rival. Hence, firm 2’s best
price response function is:

The best response functions described in (10.13) and (10.14) for the two firms are

course, where these best response functions intersect. In other words, the Nash equilibrium

In equilibrium, each firm charges a price that is equal to the unit production cost _plus_ an
amount _t_, the utility cost per unit of distance a consumer incurs in buying a good that is
at some distance from the preferred good. At these prices, the firms split the market. The
marginal consumer is located at the address _x_ = 1 _/_ 2. The profit earned by each firm is the
same, and equal to _(pi_ [∗]

By way of example, consider the two hair salons located one mile apart on Main Street. [−] _[c)N/]_ [2][ =] _[ tN][/]_ [2.]
All the potential customers live along this stretch of Main Street and are uniformly spread
out. Each consumer is willing to pay at most $50 for a haircut done at the consumer’s
home. However, if a consumer has to travel to get a haircut a round-trip travel cost of $5
per mile will be incurred. Each of the hair salons can cut hair at a constant unit cost of $10
per cut, and each wants to set a price per haircut that maximizes the salon’s profit. Our
model predicts that the equilibrium price of a haircut in this town will be $15, a price that
is greater than the marginal cost of a haircut.

Two points are worth making in connection with these results. First, note the role that
the parameter _t_ plays. It is a measure of the value each consumer places on obtaining the
most preferred version of the product. The greater _t_ is, the less willing the consumer is to
buy a product “far away” from the favorite location, product, or style. That is, a high _t_
value indicates consumers have strong preferences for their most desired product and incur
a high utility loss from having to consume a product that is less than ideal. The result is
that neither firm has much to worry about when charging a high price because consumers
prefer to pay that price rather than buy a low-price alternative that is “far away” from their
preferred style. When _t_ is large, the price competition between the two firms is softened. In
other words, a large value of _t_ means that product differentiation makes price competition
much less intense.


Oligopolistic Price Competition 255



![](/Users/nicholasvreugdenhil/ASU Dropbox/Nicholas Vreugdenhil/masters_io_2026/external/peppall_textbook_chunks/markdown/peppall_textbook_chunk11_p251-275_images/peppall_textbook_chunk11_p251-275.pdf-16-2.png)





However, as _t_ falls consumers place less value on obtaining their most preferred styles,
and become more sensitive to lower prices. This intensifies price competition. In the limit,
when _t_ = 0, product differentiation is of no value to consumers. They treat all goods as
essentially identical. Price competition becomes fierce and, in the limit, drives prices to
marginal cost just as in the original Bertrand model.

The second point concerns the location of the firms. We simply assumed that the two
firms were located at either end of town. However, the location or product design of the firm
is also part of a firm’s strategy. Allowing the two firms to choose simultaneously _both_ their
price and their location strategies makes the model too complicated to solve here. Still, the
intuition behind location choice is instructive. There are two opposing forces affecting the
choice of price and location. On the one hand, the two firms will wish to avoid locating at
the same point because to do so eliminates all differences between the two products. Price
competition in this case will be fierce, as in the original Bertrand model. On the other hand,
each firm also has some incentive to be located near the center of town. This enables a firm
to reach as large a market as possible. Evaluating the balance of these two forces is what
makes the solution of the equilibrium outcome so difficult. [11]


11 There is a wealth of literature on this topic with the outcome often depending on the precise functional
forms assumed. See, for example, Eaton (1976); D’Aspremont, Gabszewicz, and Thisse (1979); Novshek
(1980); and Economides (1989).


256 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


particular, one salon has a constant unit cost of $10 whereas the other salon has a constant
unit cost of $20. The low-cost salon, we’ll call it Cheap-Cuts, is located at the west end
of town, _x_ = 0. The high-cost salon, The Ritz, is located at the east end, _x_ = 1. There are
100 potential customers who live along the mile stretch, and they are uniformly spread out
along the mile. Consumers are willing to pay $50 for a haircut done at their home. If a
consumer has to travel to get a haircut, then a travel cost of $5 per mile is incurred. Each
salon wants to set a price for a haircut that maximizes the salon’s profit.


a. The demand functions facing the two salons are not affected by the fact that now one
salon is high cost and the other is low cost. However the salons’ best response functions
are affected. Compute the best response function for each salon. How does an increase
the unit cost of one salon affect the other salon’s best response?
b. Work out the Nash equilibrium in prices for this model. Compare these prices to the
ones derived in the text for the case when the two salons had the same unit cost equal
to $10. Explain why prices changed in the way they did. It may be helpful in your
explanation to draw the best response functions when the salons are identical and
compare them to those when the salons have different costs.


10.4 STRATEGIC COMPLEMENTS AND SUBSTITUTES


Best response functions in simultaneous-move games are extremely useful tools for
understanding what we mean by a Nash equilibrium outcome. But an analysis of such
functions also serves other useful purposes. In particular, examining the properties of best
response functions can aid our understanding of how strategic interaction works and how
that interaction can be made “more” or “less” competitive.

Figure 10.6 shows both the best response functions for the standard Cournot duopoly
model and the best response functions for the Bertrand duopoly model with differentiated

A rise in firm 2’s cost shifts its response function inwards in the Cournot model but outwards in the Bertrand
model. Firm 1 reacts aggressively to increase its market share in the Cournot case. It reacts mildly in the

products. One feature in the diagram is immediately apparent. The best response functions
for the Cournot quantity model are _negatively_ sloped—firm 1’s best response to an increase
in _q_ 2 is to _decrease q_ 1. But the best response functions in the Bertrand price model are
_positively_ sloped. Firm 1’s best response to an increase in _p_ 2 is to increase _p_ 1, as well.

Whether the best response functions are negatively or positively sloped is quite important.
The slope reveals much about the nature of competition in the product market. To see this,
consider the impact of an increase in firm 2’s unit cost _c_ 2. Our analysis of the Cournot model
indicated that the effect of a rise in _c_ 2 would be to shift _inward_ firm 2’s best response curve.
As Figure 10.6 indicates, this leads to a new Nash equilibrium in which firm 2 produces
less and firm 1 produces more than each did before _c_ 2 rose. That is, in the Cournot quantity
model, firm 1’s response to firm 2’s bad luck is a rather aggressive one in which it seizes
the opportunity to expand its market share at the expense of firm 2.

Consider now the impact of a rise in _c_ 2 in the context of the differentiated goods Bertrand
model. The rise in this case shifts firm 2’s best response function _upwards_ . Given the rise in
its cost, firm 2 will choose to set a higher _p_ 2 than it did previously in response to any given
value of _p_ 1. How does firm 1 respond? Unlike the Cournot case, firm 1’s reaction is less
aggressive. Firm 1—seeing that firm 2 is now less able to set a low price—realizes that the
price competition from firm 2 is now less intense. Hence, firm 1 now reacts by raising _p_ 1.

When the best response functions are upward sloping, we say that the strategies (prices
in the Bertrand case) are _strategic complements_ . When we have the alternative case of
downward sloping best response functions, we say that the strategies (quantities in the
Cournot case) are _strategic substitutes_ . [12] What should be clear at this point is that the
choice of modeling firm competition in terms of variables that are strategic substitutes
or complements is a crucial one. If we are interested in understanding the competitive
dynamics of a particular industry, we need to know the underlying features of that industry
that will determine that strategic variable choice. For example, in those industries in
which firms set their production schedules far in advance of putting the goods on the
market for sale, there is a good case to assume that firms compete in quantities. Examples
include aircraft producers, coffee-growers, and automobile manufacturers. In many service
industries—such as banking, insurance, and air travel—in which production levels can be
quickly adjusted, it is much more natural to think in terms of price competition.


10.5 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: BRAND COMPETITION AND
CONSUMER PREFERENCES—EVIDENCE FROM THE
CALIFORNIA RETAIL GASOLINE MARKET


Gasoline is typically produced by refiners and then shipped to a central distribution point.
The gasoline is then bought either by an unbranded independent retailer such as RaceTrac,
or by service stations selling a branded product such as an Exxon or a Chevron station.
In the latter case, a special additive unique to the brand has to be added. That is, to sell
“Chevron” gasoline, a station has to have added _Techronas_ _[TM]_ to the fuel. Thus, each specific
brand is differentiated by the use of its own additive. Independent stations, however, simply
sell the basic gasoline without any additive. Here, we briefly describe a paper by Justine


12 This terminology comes from Bulow, Geanakopolos, and Klemperer (1985) and reflects similar terminology in consumer demand theory.


258 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


Hastings (2004) that examines the nature of price competition in the retail gasoline market
in Southern California.

The background to the study is as follows. In June of 1997, the Atlantic Richfield
Company (ARCO), a well-known refiner and retail brand, acquired control of about 260
gasoline stations that formerly had been operated by the independent retailer, Thrifty, in
and around Los Angeles and San Diego. ARCO then converted these to ARCO stations—a
process that was essentially completed by September of that same year. Thus, the ARCOThrifty acquisition resulted in the exit of a large number of independent service stations in
Southern California, as these were replaced in part by ARCO sellers.

Hastings (2004) asks what effect the ARCO-Thrifty deal had on retail gasoline prices.
In principle, the effect could be either positive or negative, depending on consumer
preferences. If consumers identify brands with higher quality and independents with lower
quality, then conversion of the unbranded (low-quality) stations to the ARCO brand would
mean that these stations now sell a closer substitute to the other branded products. This
would intensify price competition and _lower_ branded gasoline prices. However, if a large
pool of consumers is unresponsive to brand labels because their willingness to pay for
higher quality is limited and they only want to buy gasoline as cheaply as possible, then the
loss of the Thrifty stations removes this low-cost alternative and _raises_ gasoline prices.

To isolate the effect of the ARCO-Thrifty merger, Hastings (2004) looked at how prices
charged by gasoline stations in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas differed depending
on whether they competed with a Thrifty or not. Her data cover the prices charged by 699
stations measured at four different times: February 1997, June 1997, October 1997, and
December 1997. Notice that the first two dates are for prices before the conversion while
the last two dates are for prices after the conversion. She then defines submarkets in which
each station’s competitors are all the other stations within one mile’s driving distance. A
simple regression that might capture the effect of the merger would be:


_pit_ _Constant_ _αi_ _β_ 1 _Xit_ _β_ 2 _Zit_ _eit_ (10.16)
= + + + +

where _pit_ is the price charged by station _i_ at time _t_ ; _αi_ is a firm-specific dummy that lets the
intercept be different for each service station; _Xit_ is a dummy variable that has the value 1 if
station _i_ competes with an independent (Thrifty) at time _t_ and 0 otherwise; likewise _Zit_ is 1
if a competitor of station _i_ has become a station that is owned by a major brand as opposed
to a station that operates as a franchisee or lessee of a major brand, and 0 otherwise. This
last variable, _Zit_ is meant to capture the impact of any differential effects depending on the
contractual relationship between a major brand and the station that sells that brand. The key
variable of interest however is _Xit_ . We want to know whether the estimated coefficient _β_ 1
is negative, which would indicate that having independent rivals generally leads to lower
prices—or is positive, which would indicate that the presence of independents softens
competition and raises prices.

However, there is a potentially serious problem with estimating equation (10.16). The
problem is that over the course of 1997, gasoline prices were rising generally throughout
Southern California. Equation (10.16) does not allow for this general rising trend. Consider
our key variable _Xit_ . In the data, this will be 1 for a lot more stations before the merger in
February and June than it will be in October and December. As a result, the coefficient _β_ 1
will likely be negative because prices were lower in February and June (when there were
a lot more independents) than in September and December (after the merger removed the
Thrifty stations). That is, _β_ 1 will be biased because it will pick up time effects as well as the


Oligopolistic Price Competition 259


effects of independents. The solution to this problem is to include variables that explicitly
isolate this time effect so that what is left after this effect is removed is a pure measure
of the impact of having an independent gasoline retailers on market prices. Accordingly,
Hastings (2004) puts in location specific time dummies for February, June, and September.
(The effect of December is of course captured in the regression constant.) That is, she
estimates an equation something like:


_pit_ _Constant_ _αi_ _β_ 1 _Xit_ _β_ 2 _Zit_ _β_ 3 _Ti_ _eit_ (10.17)
= + + + + +

where _Ti_ or time is captured not as a continuous variable but, again, by dummy variables
capturing the sequence of specific times in each location. Her results, both with and without
the time dummies (but suppressing the firm specific intercepts) are shown in Table 10.1,
below.

Consider first the column of results for the equation that includes the location time
dummies. Here, the estimate of _β_ 1, the coefficient on having a Thrifty or independent rival
in a station’s local market, implies that this led the station to lower its price by about
five cents per gallon. The standard error on this estimate is very small, so we can be very
confident of this measure. Note too how this contrasts with the effect measured in the
regression results shown in the first column that leaves out the time effects. That estimate
suggests a much larger effect a ten cents per gallon decline when a station has independent
rivals. Again, this is because in leaving out the time effects, the regression erroneously
attributes the general rise in gasoline prices throughout the region to the merger, when
in fact prices were clearly rising for other reasons as well. We should also note that the
coefficient estimate for _β_ 2 is not significant in either equation. So, the type of ownership by
a major brand does not seem to be important for retail gasoline prices.

One picture is often worth a large number of words. The graph below in Figure 10.7
illustrates the behavior of Southern California gasoline prices over the period covered by
Hastings’s data for each of two groups: 1) the treatment group that competed with a Thrifty
station; and 2) the control group of stations that did not.

Notice the general rise in prices in both groups through October. Clearly, this is a
phenomenon common to the gasoline market in general and not the result of the merger per

se. However, a close look at the data does reveal that the merger did have some impact. In
the months before the merger, stations that competed with a Thrifty had prices that were
two to three cents _lower_ than those in the control group. Starting about the time of the
merger in June, however, and continuing afterwards, these same stations had prices two to
three cents _higher_ than those in the control group. It is this roughly five-cent effect that is
being picked up in the final column of the preceding table. [13] For both groups, those that
initially competed with a Thrifty prior to the merger and those that did not, prices differ
between the beginning of 1997 and the end. To isolate the effects of the merger, we need to
look at how these differences over time were different between the two groups. If we recall
that for the treatment group stations _Xit_ 1 at first but 0 after the merger, while it is always
zero for firms in the control group, the price behavior for the two groups is: =


_Before Merger_ _After Merger_ _Difference_
_Treatment group_ : _αi_ _β_ 1 _αi_ _time effects_ _β_ 1 _time effects_
_Control Group_ : _αj_ + _αj_ + _time effects_ _time effects_    - +
+


Thus, _β_ 1 in our regression reflects the difference between the difference over time in the
treatment group and that in the control group. For this reason, _β_ 1 is often referred to as a
_difference-in-differences_ estimator.


**Summary**



In the Bertrand model, firms compete in prices.
In the simple model of Bertrand competition,
prices are pushed to marginal cost even if there
are just two firms. This result stands in sharp contrast with the outcome under quantity or Cournot
competition in which prices remain substantially
above marginal cost so long as the number of
firms is not large. In addition, high-cost firms can
survive in Cournot competition whereas they will
be forced out of business in the simple Bertrand



model. In short, Bertrand’s initial analysis predicts competitive and efficient market outcomes
even when the number of firms is quite small.

However, the efficient outcomes predicted by
the simple Bertrand model depend upon two key
assumptions. The first is that firms have extensive capacity so that it is possible to serve all of
a rival’s customers after undercutting the rival’s
price. The second key assumption is that the firms
produce identical products so that relative price



13 More recently, C. Taylor, N. Kreisle, and P. Zimmerman, (2010) use an alternative data set that suggests
the impact of the merger was to raise prices by much less than the effect found by Hastings (2004).


is all that matters to consumers when choosing
between brands. If either of these assumptions
is relaxed, the efficiency outcomes of the simple Bertrand model can no longer be obtained.
If firms must choose production capacities in
advance, the outcome with Bertrand price competition becomes closer to what occurs in the
Cournot model. If products are differentiated,
prices are again likely to remain above marginal
cost. Indeed, given the fierceness of price competition, firms have a real incentive to differentiate
their products.

A useful model of product differentiation is
the Hotelling (1929) spatial model, which we
first introduced in Chapter 4. This model uses
geographic location as a metaphor for more general distinctions between different versions of
the same product. It thereby makes it possible
to consider price competition between firms selling differentiated products. The model makes it
clear that Bertrand competition with differentiated products does not result in efficient marginal
cost pricing. It also makes clear that the deviation from such pricing depends on how much
consumers value variety. The greater value that
the typical consumer places on getting his or her
most preferred brand or version of the product,
the higher prices will rise above marginal cost.

Ultimately, the differences between Cournot
and Bertrand competition reflect underlying
differences between quantities and prices as


**Problems**


1. Suppose firm 1 and firm 2 each produce
the same product and face a market demand
curve described by _Q_ = 5000 − 200 _P_ . Firm
1 has a unit cost of production _c_ 1 equal to
6 whereas firm 2 has a higher unit cost of
production _c_ 2 equal to 10.

outcome?
b. What are the profits of each firm?
c. Is this outcome efficient?


2. Suppose that market demand for golf balls
is described by _Q_ = 90 − 3 _P_, where _Q_ is
measured in kilos of balls. There are two
firms that supply the market. Firm 1 can produce a kilo of balls at a constant unit cost of



Oligopolistic Price Competition 261


strategic variables. The quantities chosen
by Cournot firms are strategic substitutes—
increases in one firm’s production lead to
decreases in the rival’s output. In contrast, the
prices chosen by Bertrand competitors are strategic complements. A rise in one firm’s price
permits its rival to raise price, too. To be accurate,
analysis of any industry requires familiarity with
those industry features that determine whether
the competitive rivalry is played out in a setting
of strategic substitutes or strategic complements.

Models of price competition based on consumer preferences and perceived quality have
provided an extremely useful framework for academicians and policy makers alike. It is important
in this regard to identify the precise mechanism in
which consumers’ preferences for specific brands
and designs are modeled. For instance, depending on the nature of consumer preferences, a
merger between a high-quality and a low-quality
firm that results in the transformation of the lowquality firm outlets to high-quality ones could
either weaken competition because it removes a
low-quality competitor or intensify competition
because it adds to the high-quality supply. In
the case of retail gasoline markets in Southern
California, work by Hastings (2004) finds that a
merger leading to removal of a low-quality firm
raised prices, although subsequent work by Taylor, Kreisle, and Zimmerman (2010) offers some
contrasting evidence.

4. In Tuftsville, everyone lives along Main
Street, which is 10 miles long. There are
1,000 people uniformly spread up and down
Main Street, and every day they each buy
a fruit smoothie from one of the two stores
located at either end of Main Street. Customers ride their motor scooters to and from
the store using $0.50 worth of gas per mile.
Customers buy their smoothies from the store
offering the lowest price, which is the store’s
price plus the customer’s travel expenses
getting to and from the store. Ben owns the
store at the west end of Main Street and Will
owns the store at the east end of Main Street.
a. If both Ben and Will charge $1 per
smoothie, how many will each of them
sell in a day? If Ben charges $1 per
smoothie and Will charges $1.40, how
many smoothies will each sell in a day?
b. If Ben charges $3 per smoothie, what
price would enable Will to sell 250
smoothies per day? 500 smoothies per
day? 750 smoothies per day? 1,000
smoothies per day?
c. If Ben charges _p_ 1 and Will charges _p_ 2,
what is the location of the customer who
is indifferent between going to Ben’s or
Will’s shop? How many customers go to
Will’s store and how many go to Ben’s
store? What are the demand functions
that Ben and Will face?
d. Rewrite Ben’s demand function with _p_ 1
on the left-hand side. What is Ben’s
marginal revenue function?
e. Assume that the marginal cost of a
smoothie is constant and equal to $1
for both Ben and Will. In addition, each
of them pays Tuftsville $250 per day
for the right to sell smoothies. Find the
equilibrium prices, quantities sold, and
profits net of the $250 license fee.


5. Return to Main Street in Tuftsville. Now suppose that George would like to open another
store at the midpoint of Main Street. He must
pay Tuftsville an addional $250 per day to
operate this new store.



a. If Ben and Will do not change their
prices, what is the best price for George
to charge? How much profit would he
earn?
b. What do you think would happen if
George did open another store in the
middle of Main Street? Would Ben and
Will have an incentive to change their
prices? Their locations? Would one or
both leave the market?


6. Suppose that there are two firms, firm B and
firm N, that produce complementary goods,
say bolts and nuts. The demand curve for
each firm is described as follows:
