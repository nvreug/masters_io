b. WI is already earning the maximum profit possible in this industry (absent price
discrimination). Therefore, integration with one or even many downstream retailers
cannot raise WI’s profits or price P to consumers. Even if WI bought all downstream
retailers, it would still maximize profits by setting P = $55, selling 45 units, and earning
$2,025 in profit.
c. Competitive manufacturing price = marginal cost = $10. Competitive retail price =
manufacturing price = $10.


Chapter 17


17.1 .a. The Great Toy Store’s marginal revenue curve is _MR_ _[R]_ = 1,000 − 4 _Q_ and the Toy
Store maximizes profit by equating MR and MC, giving _r_ = 1,000 − 4 _Q_, which is
also Tiger-el’s demand curve. Tiger-el therefore has a marginal revenue curve of
_MR_ _[M]_ = 1,000 − 8 _Q_ . Equating this with the Tiger-el’s marginal cost _c_ = $40 yields
_Q_ = 120. From the Tiger-el demand curve, _r_ = 1000 − 4 _Q_, this implies a wholesale price
of _r_ = $520. From the retail demand curve facing the Great Toy Store, _P_ = 1,000 − 2 _Q_,
the retail price will be $760.
b. The Great Toy Store will earn profit of _(_ $760 − $520 _)_ × 120 = $28,800. Tiger-el will
earn profit of _(_ $520 − $40 _)_ × 120 = $57,600.
c. Tiger-el receives _c_ = $40 for each unit plus a sales royalty of 2 _/_ 3 of all sales. Hence,
Tiger-el’s total revenue is _(c_ + 0.667 _P )Q_ = $40 _Q_ + 0.6667 × PQ = _(_ $40 + 666.67 −
1.333 _Q)Q_ . Its marginal revenue is therefore 706.67 − 2.667 _Q_ . Equating this with its
marginal cost _c_ = $40 yields an optimal output of: _Q_ = 250. The retail price will
therefore be _P_ = 1,000 − 500 = $500. Total Toy Store revenue will be $125,000.
The Toy Store keeps one-third of this less wholesale costs = 0.3333 × $125,000 −
$40 × 250 = $41,666.67 − $10,000 = $31,666.67 as retail profit. Tiger-el keeps the
remainder = $93,333.33 as its revenue leaving it $83,333.333 as profit after production
costs.

17.2 .a. From equation (17.6) we have _(_ 10 − 6 _)/_ 2 = _s_ [2] _/_ 2 + 2 _s_ [2] + _(_ 17.7 _)_ . Hence, _s_ = ~~[√]~~ _(_ ~~2~~ _/_ ~~2.5~~ _)_
= 0.894. From equation (17.7), _P_ = _(_ 10 + 6 + _s_ [2] _)/_ 2 = $8.4. From the demand curve,
_Q_ = 0.894 _(_ 10 − 8.4 _)_ 100 = 143.4 _._ Hence, the manufacturer’s profit is: _(_ $6 − $5 _)_ ×
143.4 = $143.4 _._
b. If the wholesale price _r_ = $7, then the service level _s_ falls to _s_ = [√] _(_ ~~1.5~~ _/_ ~~2.5~~ _)_ = 0.775.
In turn, this implies a retail price of _P_ = _(_ 10 + 7 + 0.775 [2] _)/_ 2 = $8.80. The total amount
sold falls to 0.775 _(_ $10 − $8.80 _)_ 100 = 93 _._

17.3 .a. Because marginal cost _c_ = 0, profit maximization is the same as revenue maximization,
i.e., the firm will wish to produce where marginal revenue _MR_ = 0. When demand
is strong, the inverse demand is: _p_ = 10 − _Q/_ 100. Hence _MR_ _[S]_ = 10 − _Q/_ 50. The
revenue-maximizing choice of _Q_ is therefore _Q_ = $500 implying a retail price of $5.
When demand is weak, the inversed demand is: _p_ = 10 − _Q/_ 30 _,_ so that marginal revenue
in this case of _M_ _[W]_ = 10 − _Q/_ 15 which, in turn, implies an optimal output of _Q_ = 150.
Substitution of this into the weak case inverse demand curve then implies a price of $5
again.
b. If the 500 units have already been produced then their production cost is sunk. As a result,
the firm’s marginal cost is zero and it will wish to sell either the full capacity of 500 units
or to the point where _MR_ = 0, depending on which constraint binds first. When demand
is strong and _MR_ _[S]_ = 10 − _Q/_ 50, the firm will wish to sell all 500 units. When demand
is weak and _MR_ _[W]_ = 10 − _Q/_ 15 _,_ the firm will wish to sell only 150 units. In the first
case, the retail price is $5 and the firm earns a profit of $2,500. In the second case, the
retail price is again $5, but the firm earns a profit of only $750. Because these cases occur

with equal probability, the expected profit conditional on having produced 500 units is
_(_ $2500 + $750 _)/_ 2 = $1,625.
c. Once bought as a block of 500 units, competitive retailers treat the wholesale cost as
sunk. Therefore, their marginal cost is 0. Because they will sell so long as price exceeds
marginal cost, competitive retailers will sell all 500 units at the market-clearing price of
$5 if demand is strong. When demand is weak, they will continue selling until the number
of units sold is 300 and the retail price as fallen to 0.
d. Let _w_ be the implicit wholesale price per unit when a block of 500 units is initially sold.
In the competitive retail sector case, retail profits net of initial wholesale costs are $2,500
less _w_ 500 when demand is strong and 0 less _w_ 500 when demand is weak. Hence, expected
retail profits are 0.5 × $2500 + 0.5 × 0 − _w_ 500. Because competitive retailers need to
expect to break even, the wholesale price necessary to induce competitive retailers to
stock 500 units is _w_ = $2.50. If the manufacturer sets this price, competitive retailers as
a group can be persuaded to stock 500 units. Accordingly, the manufacturer will earn a
profit of $2.50 × 500 = $1,250.


Chapter 18


18.1 .a. _n_ [∗] = 2.
b. _q_ per division = 15. Profit per division = $225. Profit per firm = $450 less ($90 in sunk
division costs) $360.
c. _Q_ = 60; _P_ = $40.
d. Pure monopoly: _P_ _[M]_ = $62.50; _Q_ _[M]_ = $37.50; _�_ _[M]_ = $1406.25 less $45 _(_ sunk cost
for _n_ = 1 division _)_ = $1361.25


Chapter 19


19.1 .a. _a_ = 100 implies d _P/_ d _Q_ = −0.1; _a_ = 1,000 implies d _P/_ d _Q_ = −0.0316.
b. . i. _MR_ = 100 − 0.04 _Q._
ii. _P_ = $80; _Q_ = 1,000 _._
iii. Price elasticity _(_ absolute value _)_ = 4. Elasticity of sales with respect to advertising =
1 _/_ 2.
c. At _a_ = 2,500 _, P_ = $80; _Q_ = 1,000 ⇒ Advertising _/_ Sales Ratio = _a/PQ_ = 0.03125.
Dorfman-Steiner condition requires Advertising/SalesRatio = _(_ 1 _/_ 2 _)/_ 4 = 1 _/_ 8, is not
satisfied here. Optimal advertising rate that does satisfy Dorfman-Steiner condition
yields: _a_ = 40,000; _P_ = $80; _Q_ = 4,000.


Chapter 20


20.1 With a marginal cost of $28, the monopolist would like to price such that MR = MC. This
implies 100 − 4 _Q_ = 28, or _Q_ = 18. At this quantity, price would be _P_ = 100 − 2 _(_ 18 _)_ = $64.
However, the current market price with Bertrand competition is $60. Because the innovator’s
ideal monopoly price is greater than the current market price, this is a non-drastic innovation.
The innovator has to reduce the price to $59.99 in order to capture the market.

Say the innovator’s new marginal cost of production is _cM_ . Then we want to choose a _cM_ such
100that − _PM_ 2 _<(_ 25 60. We know MR − _cM_ _/_ 4 _)_ = 50 + = _cM_ MC and 100 _/_ 2 _._ . Monopoly price − 4 _QM_ = _P cMM, <_ so 60 implies 50 _QM_ = 25 − _cM_ + _/_ 4 _c,M_ and _/_ 2 _P <M_ 60, =
which in turn implies _cM <_ 20. In order for the innovation to be drastic, _cM_ must be less than
$20.


Answers to Practice Problems 691


20.2 .a. The innovation is non-drastic if the monopolist’s ideal price is greater than the commonopolist would profit-maximize by setting MRpetitive price, _PM > PC_ . Because the firms compete in price, MC, or 100 _PC_ =2 _cQCM_ = 75. The 60, so
_QM_ 20 and _PM_ 80. Because 80 _>_ 75, this is a non-drastic innovation. If the inno- =    - =
vation reduces cost to = = _cM_, equating MR with MC gives 100 − 2 _Q_ = _cM_ which gives
_Q_ 50 _cM_ _/_ 2 and _P_ 50 _cM_ _/_ 2. For this to be a drastic innovation requires that
=      - = +
50 _cM_ _/_ 2 75 or _cM_ $50.
b. If the market is a monopoly the monopolist sets MR + ≤ ≤ = MC, or 100 − 2 _Q_ = 75, or
_Q_ = 12.5 and _P_ = $87.5 prior to the innovation, earning profit of $156.25 per period
prior to the innovation. With the innovation MC = 60 and so the monopolist sets
100 − 2 _Q_ = 60 or _Q_ = 20 and price _P_ = 80. Profit after the innovation is therefore
$ _(_ 80 60 _)_ 20 $400 per period. The monopolist values the innovation at _VM_
$ _(_ 400 − − 156.25 × _)/_ =0.1 = $2,437.50. =
c. Cournot duopolists facing the same marginal cost each produce output _Q_ D _(A_ _c)/_
3 _B_ = 25 _/_ 3 = 8.33 _._ Aggregate output is 16.67 and so price is $83.33. Profit to each =     duopolist is $ _(_ 83.33 − 75 _)_ × 8.33 = $69.44.
d. Now we suppose firm 1 has innovated, so its marginal cost is _c_ 1 60, but firm 2 has not
innovated and still has marginal cost _c_ 2 75. Output of firm 1 is the duopoly output = _Q_ 1

output is 21.67 so price is $78.33. − + = =       - + =
e. Profit to innovation, the innovating firm is $ _(_ 78.33 − 60 _)_ × 18.33 = $336.11. The
innovating Cournot duopolist values the innovation at _VD_ $ _(_ 336.11 69.44 _)/_ 0.1
$2,666.67. Because _VD > VM_ this confirms that the duopolist values the innovation more =      - =
than the monopolist.


Chapter 21


21.1 .a. If the firms compete in price, then price is driven to marginal cost, so _P_ = $70 and _Q_ = 30.
b. If the firm chooses research activity _x_ its marginal cost becomes 70 − _x_ . Assuming that
the innovation is non-drastic, the innovating firm will set price $70 and sell 30 units. The
resulting profit per period while the patent is in force is then $ _(_ 70 − 70 + _x)_ 30 = 30 _x_ .

21.2 .a. If only BMI innovates, then ECN is shut out of the market and BMI monopolizes.
Facing a demand curve of _P_ = 100 − 2 _Q_, a marginal cost of _c_ = 50, and a fixed cost
for setting up a lab of _K_, BMI maximizes the profit function _�_ = _Q(P_       - _c)_       - _K_ =
_Q(_ 100 − 50 − 2 _Q)_     - _K_ . This function is maximized when _∂�/∂Q_ = 50 − 4 _Q_ = 0,
which is when _Q_ = 12.5 and _P_ = 100 − 2 [∗] 12.5 = 75. Monopoly profits are _�_ =
12.5 _(_ 75 − 50 _)_      - _K_ = $312.5 − _K_ . Consumer surplus is the area of the triangle with
height 100 _P_ and base _Q_, so _CS_ [1] _/_ 2 25 [∗] 12.5 $156.25.
         - = [∗] =
b. If both BMI and ECN successfully innovate, then the two firms will compete, Cournotstyle. Output of each firm is _Qi_ _(A_ _c)/_ 3 _B_ 8.33. Price is $66.67 and profit of
each firm including the cost of setting up a lab, =       - = _�_ 1 _�_ 2 8.33 _(_ 66.67 50 _)_ _K_
$138.89 − _K_ . Consumer surplus is once again the area of the triangle with height 100 = =      -      -      - = _P_
and base _Q_, so _CS_ = [1] _/_ 2 [∗] _(_ 100 − 66.67 _)_ [∗] 16.67 = $277.78.
c. If only one firm sets up a lab, then likelihood that the lab is successful and the firm
innovates is _ρ_ = 0.8, and the likelihood that the lab is unsuccessful is _(_ 1 − _ρ)_ = 0.2.
Expected profit is 0.8 _(_ $312.50 _)_       - _K_ = $250 − _K_ . If both firms set up a lab, then there
are four possible outcomes for each firm. These are

i. BMI successfully innovates and ECN does not, with probability 0.8 × 0.2;
ii. both successfully innovate with probability 0.8 × 0.8;
iii. ECN successfully innovates while BMI does not, with probability 0.2 × 0.8;
iv. neither successfully innovate with probability 0.2 × 0.2.
In each of the last two cases, BMI makes no profit. So, its expected profit is: 0.8 × 0.2 ×
$312.50 + 0.8 [2] × $138.89 − _K_ = $138.89 − _K_ . The payoff matrix is:

For (R&D, R&D) to be a Nash equilibrium $138.89 − _K >_ 0 or _K <_ $138.89. For
$138.89 _< K <_ $250 only one firm will do R&D.
e. The expected social surplus with only one lab is 0.8 _(_ $312.50 + $156.25 _)_     - _K_ =
$375 − _K_ . With two labs it is 2 × 0.8 × 0.2 × _(_ $312.50 + 156.25 _)_ + 0.8 × 0.8 ×
_(_ 138.89 + 277.78 _)_       - 2 _K_ = $416.67 − 2 _K_ . Two labs are optimal if $416.67 − 2 _K >_
$375 − _K_ or _K <_ $41.67.

21.3 .a. With Cournot competition, firms choose quantity as the strategic variable. Each firm wants
to maximize the profit function _�i_ _qi(_ 100 2 _(qi_ _q_ _i)_ _c)_ _qi(_ 40 2 _qi_ 2 _q_ _i)_ .
This function is maximized when = _∂�i/∂q_      - _i_ 40 + 4− _qi_ −2 _q_ = _i_ 0, which is when −      -      _qi_ 10 _q_ _i/_ 2. Because costs are symmetrical, = _qi_       - _q_ _i_ −, so both firms are on their best− =

ii. If firm 1 licenses the invention to firm 2 at $10 per unit, then firm 2’s marginal production cost will be $50 because of the innovation, but there is a $10 royalty fee on each
unit, so the overall marginal cost is still _c_ 2 50 10 60. However, firm 1 also
makes a profit of $10 on every unit firm 2 sells, so the new profit functions = + =
areever, leads to the same best response functions, because firm 1 does not have control _�_ 1 = _q_ 1 _(_ 50 − 2 _q_ 1 − 2 _q_ 2 _)_ + 10 _q_ 2 and _�_ 2 = _q_ 2 _(_ 40 − 2 _q_ 1 − 2 _q_ 2 _)_ . This, howover _q_ 2, so the equilibrium quantities are still _q_ 1 10 _, q_ 2 5 _,_ and _Q_ 15, and the

iii. Say that firm 1 licenses the product to firm 2 for a fee =         -         - = _K_ . Then both firms will
take advantage of the innovation and have a marginal cost _c_ = 50. Profits are

_�_ 1 _q_ 1 _(P_ 50 _)_ _K_ and _�_ 2 _q_ 2 _(P_ 50 _)_ _K_ . Best response functions are
now Firm 1: =         - _q_ 1 + 12.5 _q_ 2 _/_ 2 and Firm 2: =         - _q_ −2 12.5 _q_ 1 _/_ 2. Both firms are
on their best response functions when =         - _q_ 1 _q_ 2 = 8.33 − _, Q_ 16.67, and price

8.33 _(_ =66.67 − 50 _)_        - _K_ = 138.89 = − _K_ .        - + = + =

Firm 2 will be willing to pay the licensing fee as long as the profit from buying
the license and using the innovation is greater than the profit from part (i), where
it didn’t have the license. Thus, as long as 138.89 − _K >_ 50, firm 2 will buy the
license. This requires _K <_ 88.89.

Firm 1 should price the license so that it is just marginally better for firm 2
to buy the license, so the price should be _K_ = 88.88. Firm 1’s profits will be

_�_ 1 138.89 88.88 $227.77. Firm 2’s profits will be _�_ 2 138.89 88.88
$50.01. Note that in this example the innovator would prefer the royalty to the fixed = + = =          - =

Chapter 22


22.1 .a. The consumer who is indifferent between buying the good and not buying is has basic
valuation _vi_ satisfying the condition _(_ 0.4 + 6 _f_ [2] _)v_ _[M]_ = _p_ . Hence, with _p_ = 50, we have:
_v_ _[M]_ = _p/(_ 0.4 + 6 _f_ [2] _)_ = 50 _/(_ 0.4 + 6 _f_ [2] _)_ .
b. The market fraction _f_ that is served is given by _f_ = 1 − _v_ _[M]_ _/_ 100. Hence we have
_f_ = 1 − 0.5 _/(_ 0.4 + 6 _f_ [2] _)_ . This equality holds when either _f_ = 0.1905 or _f_ = 0.906.
The second solution is stable.


Chapter 23


23.1 A dominant strategy is one that gives you a payoff greater than any other strategy regardless
of what is chosen by other players. Clearly it does not pay to bid more than your willingness
to pay. You will lose anytime that you win. The other strategy you could choose is to stop
bidding when the price is less than your true valuation. Suppose that the auction price is _p_ and
your true valuation is _V_ . If _p < V_ and you stop bidding your payoff is 0, whereas if you bid
_p_ + _ε < V_ then your payoff is _V_   - _(p_ + _ε) >_ 0. So, for any _p < V_, continuing to bid is a
dominant strategy. Because you also cannot gain but may lose if you bid _V_ + _ε_, bidding _V_ is
a dominant strategy.


23.2 Your best strategy here is to assume that you are the one with the highest valuation. In
other words you assume that the other seven bidders have valuations drawn from a uniform
distribution over the interval [0, 200]. If we assume that these bids are evenly spaced out over
the interval then the lowest would be 25 _(_ = 1 _/_ 8 [∗] 200 _)_, the next 50 _(_ = 2 _/_ 8 [∗] 200 _)_, the next 75,
the next 100, the next 125, the next 150, and finally the highest bid from the other bidders will
be 175 _(_ = 7 _/_ 8 [∗] 200 _)_ . You should submit a bid of $175 to win the auction.

Chapter 24



24.1 .a. The marginal revenue for firm A is: MRA 1000 _q_ B 2 _q_ A. Setting this equal to
marginal cost MCA 400 yields firm A’s best response function: =      -      - _q_ A 300 _q_ B _/_ 2. By
symmetry, firm B’s best response is: = _q_ B 300 _q_ A _/_ 2. Hence, the Nash equilibrium =       is: _q_ A _q_ B 200, implying _Q_ 400 _P_ = $600 − and profit to each firm _π_ A _π_ B
$40,000 = _._ = = ; = ; = =
b. From equation (24.8) or (24.9), the optimal subsidy _s_ [∗] = _(A_     - _c)/_ 4. Here we have
A = $1000 and _c_ = marginal cost = $400. Hence the optimal subsidy is _s_ [∗] = $150.
It follows from equation (24.3) that _q_ A _(_ 1000 400 2 _s_ [∗] _)/_ 3 300. Firm B’s best
response function in turn implies that: _q_ =B 300       - _q_ A _/_ 2 + 150. Because total output is =
_Q_ = 450, the market price is $550. =    - =



i. Firm A’s profit is: _(_ $550 _c_ _s_ [∗] _)q_ A $300 300 $90,000.
ii. The cost of the subsidy is − _s_ [∗] _q_ +A $150 = 300 × $45,000. =
iii. The net gain from the subsidy is $90,000 = × − $45,000 = = $45,000



24.2 In general, we know from Chapter 9 that the Cournot model with cost differences implies
the following output levels: _q_ A _(A_ 2 _c_ A _c_ B _)/_ 3 and _q_ B _(A_ _c_ A 2 _c_ B _)/_ 3. Before
the tariff, the marginal cost for each firm is =    - + _c_ A ; _c_ B 12. Hence, prior to the tariff, = +    each firm had output: _q_ A _q_ B 88 _/_ 3. So, total output was = = _Q_ 58.67 implying a price
_P_ = $41.33. Pre-tariff profit to firm A is: 29.33 = = [2] = $860.44. Consumer surplus in Country =
A in the no-tariff case is: 0.5 × _(_ 100 − 41.33 _)_ × 58.67 = $1720.89. After the tariff, firm
A still has a marginal cost of _c_ A 12. However, firm B loses scale economies and so
has an increase in the marginal cost of production to = _s_ B 14. To this higher marginal
cost, we must add the additional 2-dollar tariff. Hence, within country A, firm faces an =
implicit marginal cost—production plus tariff—of 14 + 2 = 16 for units sold in country A.
It follows that after the tariff, each firm’s output will be: _q_ A _(_ 100 24 16 _)/_ 3 92 _/_ 3;
and _q_ B _(_ 100 12 32 _)/_ 3 80 _/_ 3. Hence, total output is = _Q_ 57.333, implying a price − + =
of _P_ = = $42.67. Firm A’s profit is now: +    - = _(_ $42.67 − $12 _)_ × 92 = _/_ 3 = $940.455. Consumer
surplus in Country A is now: 0.5 × _(_ 100 − 42.67 _)_ × 57.33 = $1643.46. Producer surplus
has increased by $940.44 − $860.44 = $80. Consumer surplus has decreased by $1720.89 −
$1643.46 = $77.33.
