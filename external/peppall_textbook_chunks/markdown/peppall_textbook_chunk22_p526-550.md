## **Part Six**
# **Non-Price Competition**

So far, most of our analysis has focused on interfirm competition centered on quantity or
price. However, firms compete in many other dimensions, as well. Two such competitive
mechanisms are advertising and innovative effort. These are the topics addressed in Part
Six.

Advertising has long been an issue of both academic and popular concern. Initially,
economists focused on the use of advertising to build brand loyalty and thereby to soften
price competition between different brands. However, subsequent analysis has focused on
the informational role of advertising. By helping consumers learn what alternatives are
available and at which prices, by informing consumers about the appropriate uses of a new
product and its overall quality, and in numerous other ways, advertising can play a useful
role in improving the welfare of both producers and consumers. In Chapter 19 we examine
many economic models of advertising. We also present Ackerberg’s (2001) empirical paper
offering evidence on the critical role that advertising plays as information regarding what
products are being sold and what their critical features are.

In Chapter 20, we consider the general issues of innovation and Schumpeterian competition. Chapter 20 begins with a presentation of a well-known set of propositions typically
referred to jointly as the Schumpeterian hypotheses. This is that large firms and concentrated
industries are necessary for technological innovation. This chapter explicitly addresses the
nature of R&D competition and precisely the sort of market structure that most encourages
technical progress. We also explore the potential gains and losses when firms cooperate
on R&D activity, and review empirical evidence on the Schumpeterian hypotheses. We
conclude with a consideration of the evidence on the spillovers from one firm’s R&D to
another’s as found in the empirical work of Keller (2002).

In Chapter 21, we consider public policy designed to encourage R&D, especially patent
policy. Such policy must walk a thin line between granting wide access to available
technologies and yet also giving innovators the rights to restrict such access so as to earn a
return on their inventions. We discuss recent patent policy developments and, in particular,
the rise of the so-called “patent thicket.” We also note the issues that arise in a patent
system when patents are issued sequentially, and all patents are needed to pursue further
innovation. The empirical study for this chapter is the Hall and Zedonis (2001) paper on
innovation in the semiconductor industry.


### **19** **Advertising, Market Power, and Information**

Large retail stores that sell many different kinds of goods and many different brands of each
good are a relatively recent phenomenon in the history of commerce. A customer buying,
say, a pair of shoes in the early twentieth century would have faced a different shopping
experience from the one faced today. The consumer would have been restricted to making
a purchase in a specialized shoe store carrying only one or at most two brands, or possibly
a cobbler’s shop that made its own shoes. In addition, the consumer of a hundred years
ago would have had to consult with the store proprietor, and would not have been able to
examine and compare the merchandise directly.

How different the modern shopping experience is from the practices of the not-so-distant
past. Today’s consumer can go to a shoe or department store and see a whole range of
different brands. Once there, the consumer can personally handle and inspect each different
style without any need to deal with a store employee. Only when the consumer decides
actually to try a specific pair of shoes on will the assistance from a store employee be
required—and even that is not always necessary. Consumers now may choose directly from
an even wider range of different brands and never deal with a sales representative when
they purchase shoes over the web.

What has made this dramatic change in the nature of retailing possible? Our reference
to the web provides a clue. The retailing revolution of the twentieth century that has
continued to the digital commerce of the twenty-first owes much to the advent of mass
media. Beginning with radio, then television, and now the Internet, technological change
in telecommunications has made it possible for manufacturers to reach their consumers
en masse and promote their products directly to the public. With wide scale advertising,
manufacturers themselves can promote their products directly to a wide target audience. In
turn, this has facilitated the formation of large-scale retail establishments such as department
stores, discount stores, and web-based retailers like Amazon, each selling several varieties
of hundreds of different kinds of goods. Mass communication and large-scale advertising
have developed hand-in-hand, leading to a sustained dramatic change in the way consumers
learn about the products that are out there waiting for them to buy. [1]

and promotional activities, see D. Pope, _The Making of Modern Advertising_, (1983).


Advertising, Market Power, and Information 517


Yet while it is clear that the emergence of large-scale advertising has played a crucial role
in the development of retailing, the full nature of advertising’s impact remains a puzzle.
We do not know exactly how advertising affects the consumer’s decision of whether to
buy and if so, what brand to buy. Consider, for example, television ads for Nike shoes.
These ads often say little about the nature of the shoes and instead just feature a collage of
images accompanied by the Nike Company’s famous “swoosh” logo. How does this affect
a consumer’s decision to buy? In some Nike ads the company expressly points out that it
is a corporate sponsor and apparel provider for the US Olympic team. How does this affect
the consumer’s decision of whether to purchase Nike shoes?

The question as to how ads like those run by Nike actually work is important for many
reasons. To begin with, Nike is not alone. Its promotional efforts are typical of many firms
marketing consumer products and these efforts are very costly. Advertising on network
television, for example, can cost millions of dollars for a single minute of airtime. For the
2013 Super Bowl the average price of a 30-second spot was a record-breaking $3.75 million,
with some spots going for over $4 million and all spots sold more than a month before the
Super Bowl itself. [2] Still, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Frito-Lay, Pepsi-Cola, Proctor & Gamble,
and others all bought spots for that game. We would like to understand first how advertising
works in order to understand the incentives for these firms to incur such costs. At that point
we can examine the decisions of firms to promote their products and why firms in some
industries do much more advertising than those in others. Understanding how advertising
works allows us to move on to investigate how advertising affects the strategic interaction
between firms, and what this means for the consumer.

Our goal in this chapter is to understand the role of advertising and the implications that
this carries for strategic interaction in the market place and consumer welfare. Advertising
is provided by both manufacturers, e.g., Nike, and by retailers, e.g., Target. As a result,
the provision of promotional services involves many of the vertical incentive conflicts
that we have discussed in the previous two chapters. For the most part, we will suppress
the distinction between manufacturer and retailer and focus on how advertising affects
consumer buying decisions and the strategic interaction among firms competing for the
consumer’s patronage. We are interested in how advertising works, what information or
other features advertising provides that induces consumers to buy the advertised brand, and
what impact advertising has on the market.

Advertising could be viewed as an integral element of competition among firms that sell
different brands of the same good. In this case, high advertising could be considered a sign
of good health—a way to increase consumer awareness of different brands and therefore
a vital component of healthy competition. In contrast, advertising could be seen as a way
to differentiate one manufacturer’s brand from another and thereby weaken competition
by making it less likely that a consumer will switch brands. High advertising in this case
would be a sign of market power. There is a long-standing policy concern that advertising
expenditures overall could be socially wasteful (see Reality Checkpoint and Appendix)—in
that each firm’s effort to switch consumers to its brand just offsets its rivals’ so that
these expenditures yield no net gain to any firm. Our analysis should provide a better
understanding of this issue as well. However, gaining insight into whether there is too
much or too little advertising requires that we learn the underlying economic logic behind
advertising. Why do firms do it and how does it work?

19.1 ADVERTISING: PRACTICE AND THEORY


The phenomenon of advertising is something of a paradox. Promotional efforts such as
TV commercials are often barely tolerated by social critics. Advertising is frequently
disparaged as something that is wrong with contemporary society—something that tricks
us into wanting and even buying things we don’t need. At the same time, advertising is
ubiquitous. It airs on our television sets and radios, accounts for many of the pages in
magazines and daily newspapers, dots the landscape and cityscape with billboards, and
even shows up on our T-shirts and other apparel. However, much one might be critical of
advertising, it seems that we can hardly live without it.

The magnitude of the advertising phenomenon as reflected in total dollars of expenditure
is substantial. From the 1950s to 2008, total expenditure on advertising in the United States
has consistently amounted to roughly 2 percent of the gross domestic product. [3] This has
fallen somewhat in the wake of the Great Recession that began in late 2007. Thus, in 2011,
while total US advertising expenditures were a quite substantial $250 billion, that amounted
to only 1.65 percent of that year’s GDP. Of this amount, nearly two-thirds was for measured
media advertising. This includes spending on nationwide broadcast and cable television
networks, radio networks, national magazines, newspapers, yellow pages, and the Internet.
The other one-third is non-measured, or only indirectly measured media spending. This
category includes expenditures on direct mailings, promotions, coupons, catalogs, business

Advertising, Market Power, and Information 519


publications, and the sponsorship of special events. Retail advertising is often more heavily
concentrated in non-measured media spending. [4]

Firms differ substantially in their advertising behavior. Based on measured media
advertising in the United States, Procter & Gamble was the largest 2011 advertiser,
spending $2.9 billion. However, telecommunications firms such as AT&T, Verizon, and
Comcast all spent well over $1 billion, as did the reborn car makers General Motors and
Chrysler, and each of these firms was among the top ten advertisers of 2011. In contrast,
Apple computers was some way down the list with total expenditures of $62 million. [5]

In order to compare advertising efforts across firms of different sizes we typically
compute advertising expenditure as a percentage of sales revenue. Even looking at this
fraction—the advertising-to-sales ratio—still leaves considerable variation among firms,
however. In 2011, the ratio for Procter & Gamble was about 11 percent, whereas for Apple
computer it was closer to 1 percent. For most automakers, the advertising-to-sales ratio
is on the order of 2 to 3 percent. Within the pharmaceutical industry, Pfizer’s measured
advertising spending came close to 9 percent of its sales revenue. Yet its rival Merck was
closer to 3 percent. Johnson & Johnson, which is both a pharmaceutical maker and medical
equipment manufacturer, had a 2011 advertising-to-sales ratio of about 5.2 percent. [6]

In sum, we see significant differences in advertising intensity between industries and even
between firms in the same industry. The clear implication is that advertising is a strategic
variable chosen by individual firms in response to their perceived strategic environment.
To understand that choice—and its implications—we need to consider that environment
and precisely how advertising works in that setting.


19.2 ADVERTISING AND MARKET POWER


As we noted earlier, economic research on advertising has been a long-running enterprise.
Indeed, even Alfred Marshall (1890) devoted some consideration to advertising and its
ability to facilitate the exploitation of scale economies. [7] Much of the earliest work, however,
came in the early post World War II period and this drew a fairly negative assessment that
advertising is a socially wasteful way for firms to compete that tends to foster market power

[Kaldor (1950), Galbraith (1958), Solow (1967)]. [8] One notable study in this last regard
is that by Nichols (1951) of the American cigarette market. Nichols provides statistical
evidence that the major brands relied heavily on advertising to differentiate their products
and thereby soften price competition, especially that of “penny cigarettes.”

Two further studies that were particularly influential—both with deep roots in the
Structure-Conduct-Performance framework—were those of Bain (1956) and Comanor and
Wilson (1967). Bain (1956), found that both concentration and profitability were positively
linked and that, in turn, the central factor preserving concentration was the barrier to
entry provided by intense advertising that differentiated incumbent products from those
of potential new entrants. Similarly, using a somewhat more sophisticated regression
analysis, Comanor and Wilson (1967) found that industries with high profitability are

520 Non-Price Competition


closely associated with those that have a high advertising to sales ratio. This result was
soon replicated in several similar studies for different time periods and different countries. [9]

However, in examining any link between advertising and market structure, we again
need to remember that both are potentially endogenous variables. Advertising may foster
concentration and market power but market power may equally be at least as an important
determinant of advertising. We therefore need to separate out the causality in understanding
any connection between the two. Moreover, if advertising does work by changing consumer
tastes then calculating its effects requires that we think carefully about how it does this and
what this implies for the benefits that consumers derive from the product.


19.3 THE MONOPOLY FIRM’S PROFIT-MAXIMIZING LEVEL
OF ADVERTISING


Rational firms will only expend considerable resources on advertising if it is profitable
to do so. Because advertising is costly, this means that it must generate revenue to cover
those costs. In other words, advertising must affect demand. It is useful in this respect to
recall that any firm with market power faces a downward sloping demand curve. The firm
is interested in pushing its demand curve out and selling more at the same price rather than
selling more by lowering its price and moving down along the existing demand curve. So,
one way of thinking of how advertising works is that advertising shifts the firm’s demand
curve. In other words, demand depends not only upon the price the firm sets but also
upon the amount of advertising that the firm chooses. This can be described by the general
inverse demand function: _P_ = _P(Q, α)_ where _P_ is the product price and _α_ is the amount
of advertising, measured for example as seconds of television or radio time, or perhaps as
page space in newspapers or magazines per period. As usual, we assume that for a given
level of advertising, the firm’s demand falls as the price _P_ rises, i.e., to sell more output
_Q_ requires that the price _P_ fall. Consistent with our assumption that advertising shifts the
demand curve outward, this means that we may assume that for a given output _Q_, the
price consumers are willing to pay rises as the amount of advertising increases. The inverse
demand function _P_ = _α(A_ - _BQ)_ is an example of a demand relation that would satisfy
these requirements.

Whatever the specific demand function, the ability of advertising to increase demand
is the “good news” of advertising. The “bad news” is that advertising is costly. We will

10

assume that every unit of advertising or advertising message costs the firm _cα_ and that

every unit of production costs the firm _cG_ . It then follows that the firm will earn a total
profit _π(Q, α)_ given by:


_π(Q, α)_ [ _P(Q, α)_  - _cG_ ] _Q_  - _cαα_ (19.1)
=

The firm’s profit maximization strategy now involves two choices. It must pick a both
a level of output _Q_ and a level of advertising _α_ that together maximize profit. Yet while
the profit-maximization decision now has two dimensions, we can still use some of our
basic insights from our earlier work to determine the implications of such profit-maximizing


9 See, for example, Lambin (1976), Geroski (1982), and Round (1983).
10 This assumption may not always hold. Often there is considerable quantity discounting when air time,
network time, or magazine space is purchased by a firm for advertising.


Advertising, Market Power, and Information 521


behavior. To begin with, we know that given an optimal amount of advertising _α_ [∗], the firm’s
optimal output _Q_ [∗] will need to satisfy the requirement that given that advertising level,
marginal revenue equals marginal production cost _cG_ at _Q_ [∗] . In turn, we know from our work
in Chapter 4 that this implies that the firm’s price-cost margin as measured by the Lerner
Index be equal to the inverse of the price elasticity of demand. That is, a necessary condition
for the firm to be setting the optimal price _P_ [∗] (producing the optimal output _Q_ [∗] ) is:



_P_ [∗] - _cG_

optimal price choice _P_ [∗] and conditional, as noted, on the given level of advertising _α_ .



Now consider the monopoly firm’s optimal amount of advertising, or _α_ [∗] . At any given
price _P_ the firm’s corresponding output _Q_ will rise if advertising _α_ also increases, i.e.,



_�Q_



_�α_ _[>]_ [ 0. This extra output will generate additional profit of] _[ (P]_ [ –] _[c)]_ [ per unit. So, the total]



net revenue from an increase in advertising _α_ is just: _(P_ - _cG)_ _[�]_ _�α_ _[Q]_



net revenue from an increase in advertising _α_ is just: _(P_ - _cG)_ _�α_ [. The firm will therefore]

wish to keep raising its advertising, keep raising _α_, up to the point where this net revenue
increase just covers the marginal cost. Therefore, an additional condition that the firm must
meet is that it choose an optimal amount of advertising such that:



_(P_ _c)_ _[�][Q]_ (19.3)
 - _�α_ [=] _[ c][α]_



If we now divide both sides of equation (19.3) by total sales _PQ_ and multiply both sides
by total advertising _α_, we then obtain:

_PQ_



_(P_ _cG)_

_�Q_ _[c][α][α]_

Note that the right-hand side of equation (19.4) is the ratio of total advertising expense
_cαα_ to total sales _PQ_, i.e., the standard advertising-to-sales measure of the firm’s advertising
intensity. We may get some insight into the left-hand-side by rewriting equation (19.4) as
follows:




_P_ ∗ - _cG_

_P_ [∗]



_(�Q/Q)_ _[c][α][α]_

_(�α/α_ [∗] _)_ _PQ_

_PQ_ _total sales_

(19.5)
_total sales_



where we have now indicated that this condition must also hold when the firm chooses both
the optimal price _P_ [∗] and the optimal advertising effort _α_ [∗] . From equation (19.2) we know
that at this optimum the first term on the left-hand side of (19.4) is the inverse of the price
elasticity of demand _εP_ .



Now consider the second left-hand-side term _[(�][Q][/Q)]_



_(�α/α_ [∗] _)_ [. As a little thought quickly]



reveals, this term captures the proportional change in the quantity demanded _(�Q/Q)_ in
response to a proportional change in advertising effort _(�α/α_ [∗] _)_ measured at the optimal


522 Non-Price Competition


level of _α_ . Hence, it is naturally interpreted as the elasticity of demand with respect to
advertising _εα_ . Thus, we may now write equation (19.5) quite simply as:



_εα_
_εP_




_[advertising expense]_ (19.6)
= _total sales_



We now have a key result. The firm with market power maximizes profit by choosing a
price (or output level) and a level of advertising such that the ratio of advertising expenditure
to sales is just equal to the ratio of the advertising elasticity of demand to the price elasticity
of demand. This result is usually referred to as the Dorfman-Steiner condition after the
pioneering paper on advertising written by Dorfman and Steiner in (1954). [11] It makes clear
that whatever effect advertising efforts may have in creating and preserving market power,
basic theory implies that there is a direct causal link between a firm’s market power as
measured by its Lerner Index and the amount of advertising the firm does. Specifically,
firms with greater market power facing less elastic demand and therefore able to set a higher
markup of price over cost will be firms that do more advertising. In turn, this means that any
positive correlation we see in the data between a measure of market power and a measure
of advertising intensity does not by itself mean that the higher advertising is causing the
greater market power. Instead, it may well be the case that it is the greater market power
leading to the greater advertising. Think of it this way. A perfectly competitive firm is a
price-taker that faces an infinitely elastic demand. Equation (19.6) therefore implies that
such a firm should have an advertising-to-sales ratio of zero, i.e., it should do no advertising.
The underlying intuition is that the perfectly competitive firm can sell all that it wants
to at the current price. It does not need to advertise and “push out” its demand curve to
sell more. It is only those firms with less elastic demand that, in the absence of increased
advertising, can only sell additional units by lowering the price that have the real incentive to
advertise.

19.4 THE ECONOMIC ROLE OF ADVERTISING


It is clear from the foregoing that the market environment is a key determinant of
firms’ advertising choices. Yet as noted, there is a long intellectual tradition arguing
the reverse—that advertising itself has an important impact on the competitive setting,
especially as it affects barriers to entry. Whether and if this is the case, depends in important
ways on just precisely how advertising works to increase consumer demand. Does it truly
alter consumer preferences? Or does it merely provide information about the availability
and price of goods?


19.4.1 Advertising as Consumer Persuasion


As noted, a very common view of advertising is that it actually changes consumer
preferences in favor of the advertised good. Consumers are thereby induced to purchase
more of a particular brand than they would have in the absence of advertising. This is
reflected in an outward shift in the demand curve for the advertised good.

Evaluating the impact of persuasive advertising is tricky on several counts. To begin with,
some of the persuasion may be based on fraudulent claims. Indeed, an important reason for
the creation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was to protect consumers against false
or deceptive advertising characteristic of “snake oil” sales pitches of the late nineteenth and
early twentieth century. Even today, the FTC’s Consumer Protection Division is one of its
busiest. In 2012, the division forced Oreck to cease advertising its claim that its vacuum
cleaners and air purifiers could prevent the flu, and required Nivea to halt advertising that
its _My Silhouette!_ skin cream could help users lose weight. Both Oreck and Nivea paid fines
as well. In the case of the shoe company, Reebock, the FTC not only forced the firm to
stop advertisements that claimed its “toning shoes” provided extra tone and strength to leg
and buttock muscles, but also required the firm to issue $25 million in customer refunds.
As these were just some of the hundreds of deceptive advertising complaints that the FTC
handled, it seems clear that fraudulent persuasive advertising is a real phenomenon. In these
cases, any outward shift in the demand curve is likely to prove temporary as consumers
learn of the product’s true qualities. [12] We return to this issue below in our discussion of
advertising as information (or misinformation).

More importantly, the view that advertising changes consumer preferences raises difficult
issues in economic analysis as the usual assumption is that preferences are given. That is,
we usually assume that the consumer has a given utility function that reflects tastes and that
determines the consumer’s willingness to pay for different goods and services. If we are to
assert that advertising can change these tastes, then the calculation of consumer surplus and
welfare measures becomes complicated.

Two approaches are described in Dixit and Norman (1978). Both may be illustrated by
Figure 19.1. Here _D_ 0 is the demand curve that reflects consumers’ innate tastes before
any advertising, while _D_ 1 is the demand curve that reflects those tastes as altered by


12 The demand shift may last longer in some cases. For example, in the case of negative options such as used
by book clubs and credit card protection services, among others. In these cases, the advertiser persuades
the consumer to make an initial purchase, e.g., to try 30 days of credit card protection. The catch is that
after 30 days, the customer continues to receive and to pay for the service unless the customer explicitly
indicates that it is no longer wanted.

persuasive advertising. As shown, the advertising has shifted out the demand curve and
led to both an increase in price (from _P_ 0 to _P_ 1) and an increase in the quantity purchased
(from _Q_ 0 to _Q_ 1).

Suppose we take the view that it is the original demand curve _D_ 0 that is the relevant
one for analyzing welfare. In this view, the advertising clearly makes consumers worse off.
They now paymore for the initial amount that they were buying—a loss captured by the
sum of areas 1 and 2 in the figure. In addition, they now buy an additional _Q_ 1– _Q_ 0 goods
at price _P_ 1 that they do not truly value at that price. This loss is reflected in area 4. Thus,
in total, consumers lose areas 1 + 2 + 4. Note though that this sum also reflects an equal
gain in producer surplus. That is, areas 1 + 2 + 4 reflect not a deadweight loss but, instead,
a transfer from consumers to producers. In addition, producers now also earn the further
amount captured by area 5. This additional profit does not come free, however. The cost of
obtaining it is the cost of the advertising itself. Let us assume that the advertising cost is _A_
dollars. The net welfare gain or loss for society will then be area 5– _A_ .

One can immediately see that the above case suggests that firms with market power will
advertise excessively. For the firm, the net profit gain from spending _A_ on advertising is
1 + 2 + 4 + 5– _A_ . For society though, the net gain is simply area 5– _A_ . The former will
often be positive even when the latter is negative and firms will advertise too much.

Do matters change if we instead base our surplus calculations on the demand curve _D_ 1,
which reflects consumers’ preferences after being exposed to advertising? The answer is,
a little but not much. If we use the demand curve _D_ 1 consumers still lose areas 1 + 2
from their initial surplus. However, area 4 is no longer a loss as consumers now value
these additional units at least as much as the price _P_ 1 that they are paying for them. From
consuming _Q_ 1 units of the goods, consumers now gain additional surplus represented by
areas 6 + 3. The net change in consumer surplus is then area 3 + 6 less area 1 + 2. For the
firm though the profit gain is the same, namely the sum of areas 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 _._

Thus, using the post-advertising demand curve suggests that advertising may be less
hurtful to consumers and more beneficial overall. Ultimately, however, it will still tend to
be excessive. To see why, it is easiest if we assume advertising is subject to diminishing
returns so that the same expenditure _A_ pushes the demand curve out by smaller and smaller
amounts. In the limit, few additional units are sold and areas 3, 4, and 5 become increasingly


Advertising, Market Power, and Information 525


small. The price effects, though, that permit a rise in the price consumer pays for the initial
_Q_ 0 units are first order effects. Even as consumers begin to cut back on their purchases, the
firm can still gain area 1 in profit. Yet because this comes at consumers’ expense, it does
not represent a net social gain that would justify the additional advertising expense. [13]

Our analysis so far has not addressed the competitive impact of persuasive advertising.
This is in fact not easy. Clearly, if one firm can use advertising to increase the demand
for its product at the expense of a rival, the rival ought to be able to counteract that
with advertising of its own. If advertising is truly uninformative and merely an effort in
persuasion, this will yield excessive advertising at the industry if not the firm level as a
“war of wasteful advertising” breaks out. The view of Bain (1956) and others, though, is
that advertising competition is not typically this symmetric. In particular, incumbent firms
may have the advantage of spreading the cost of advertising over an existing large volume
of output relative to smaller new entrants. This will be especially true if advertising is not
continuous but must be purchased in indivisible chunks. However, the competitive impact
of advertising may be greatly altered if advertising conveys useful information.


19.4.2 Informative Advertising


There are many ways that advertising can provide useful information. It may for instance
inform potential customers what the product does, as in medical products advertising or,
relatedly, useful characteristics of the product, as in a digital camera’s ability to interact with
the Internet or an automobile’s safety features. To the extent that such information enhances
the demand for the product it works to shift in much the same way as the persuasive
advertising illustrated in Figure 19.1.


_Informative Advertising and Signaling_


One difficulty with understanding advertising as an effort to provide consumers with
information is that, as noted earlier, much advertising includes little or no information
about the product. Yet even here it is possible that advertising nevertheless conveys useful
information as two very influential articles by Nelson (1970, 1974) argue cogently.

Nelson (1970, 1974) began by raising the following question. “What do consumers _know_
about a product _before_ they purchase it?” More specifically, Nelson (1970, 1974) asked,
“Can consumers identify the quality or other characteristics of the product before they try
it?” For certain goods, specifically goods such as basic table salt or perhaps sunglasses, the
answer is largely, “yes.” There is very little variation in table salt and eyeglasses can be tried
on and sampled before any purchase is made. These goods are examples of what are often
called _search goods_ in that the primary objective in shopping for them is to seek out where
they are offered at the lowest price. However, Nelson argued that many for other goods,


13 Fisher and McGowan (1979) criticize the Dixit and Norman (1978) approach by arguing that the truly
relevant comparison is one between the pre-advertising equilibrium using pre-advertising tastes and the
post-advertising equilibrium using post-advertising tastes. This would mean that area 6 in Figure 19.1
would have to be included in the latter. Because this is not appropriated by the firm, its inclusion could
easily yield the contrary result that the firm’s advertising is below the socially optimal level. To some
extent, however, this introduces the familiar problem of interpersonal comparison of utility levels. Note
too that if there are strong scale economies, the increased output that advertising induces may lead to
declining cost and price. This would complicate the welfare analysis further.

such as medications and personal computers, the answer was largely, “no.” These goods
fall into a category that might be called _experience goods_, for which consumers cannot
know the quality of the product—especially its quality in terms of the specific setting of
a particular consumer—until after they have bought and used the product. However, the
manufacturer of the product knows from the start whether it is a high-quality or low-quality
product.

Nelson’s argument regarding the role of advertising in the case of experience goods is
then quite straightforward. Once a consumer buys an experience good, the consumer will
learn through use what sort of quality it is. To make matters a little more concrete, we will
suppose that if it is a low-quality product, its value to the consumer is zero whereas if it is
high-quality, its value is $40. This quality is a random event based on the success of the
product’s design with the probability being 80 percent that the design will work well. The
actual production cost per unit is $16 regardless of the kind of good being produced and
the elasticity of demand is constant at _ε_ D 3, regardless of the size of the market. As a
result, we know from Chapter 4 that the firm’s optimal price is (from the Lerner Condition) =
_P_ [∗] = $24. Both the firm and consumers have a two-period horizon.

We will assume that the total demand for the product at the profit-maximizing price
_P_ [∗] = $24 depends on the perceived quality of the good. If consumers know nothing more
than the fact that there is a 20 percent chance of the product being low-quality, enough
are sufficiently risk averse that only X consumers will purchase the product. However, if
a product is known to be a high-quality good, demand rises by the proportionate amount
_α_ to _(_ 1 + _α)_ X. Finally, first-time sales only occur in the first period. The only buyers in
the second period are those consumers who bought in the first period and, because of their
experience, buy again in period 2 if the product is high-quality.

Note that regardless of whether the firm has a high-quality or low-quality product to
offer, it will want to sell to as many first-period consumers as possible because it earns a
profit of $24–$16 = $8 on every unit. Thus, regardless of its type, the firm would definitely
like to claim that it is offering a high-quality product and expand first-period demand from
X to _(_ 1 + _α)_ X. For this reason, just announcing that it is selling a high-quality good will
not be enough to distinguish a high-quality firm from a low-quality one in the eyes of
consumers.

However, there is one key difference between the two types of firms that may be
exploitable. This is the fact that whatever customers it captures in period 1, a firm selling
a high-quality good will gain all consumers back in the second period as repeat customers
whereas one selling a low-quality product will not. For the moment, let us assume that if
a firm adapts a first-period advertising program that costs $ _A_, consumers will regard it as
selling a high-quality product. In that case, the firm making a high-quality product has the
following choice. If it does not advertise, it will earn profits over the two periods with a
present value _V_ _[H]_ of:


_V_ _[H]_ = $8X + _R_ $8X = $8 _(_ 1 + _R)X_ ; 0 _< R <_ 1 (19.7)


where _R_ is the discount factor discussed in Chapter 2. Alternatively, the firm selling a
high-quality good can spend $ _A_ on an advertising campaign and earn two-period profit with
present value _VA_ _[H]_ [:]


_VA_ _[H]_ (19.8)

[=][ $8] _[(]_ [1][ +] _[ α)X]_ [ +][ $8] _[R((]_ [1][ +] _[ α)X]_ [–] _[A]_ [ =][ $8] _[(]_ [1][ +] _[ R) (]_ [1][ +] _[ α)X]_ [–$] _[A]_


Advertising, Market Power, and Information 527


Thus, if consumers view advertising as a signal of high quality, a high-quality firm will find
it profitable to advertise if _VA_ _[H]_ _[> V][ H]_ [, i.e., if $8] _[(]_ [1][ +] _[ R)α][X][ >]_ [ $] _[A]_ [ or:]


_A_
(19.9)
8 _αX_ _[<]_ [ 1][ +] _[ R]_


Of course, if spending $ _A_ on an advertising campaign induces more first-period consumers
to buy then a low-quality firm has some incentive to do this, too. If this turns out to be
profitable, if both a low-quality and a high-quality firm gain from first-period advertising,
then consumers cannot use the fact of advertising to indicate quality. Thus, we must make
sure that this is not the case if advertising is to play a quality-signaling role in equilibrium.

Recall though that a low-quality firm will never make any second-period sales. Hence,
it earns a profit of $8 _X_ if it does not advertise and a profit of $8 _(_ 1 + _α)X_ –$ _A_ if it does.
Therefore, a low-quality firm will not advertise if:


_A_
(19.10)
8 _αX_ _[>]_ [ 1]


Putting conditions (19.9) and (19.10), we have the following result. Consumers will be
right to assume that a firm is selling a high-quality product if it is spending an amount $ _A_
on advertising that satisfies:


_A_
1 _R >_ (19.11)
+ 8 _αX_ _[>]_ [ 1]


Because the discount factor _R_ always exceeds 0, there will always be some value of
_A_ —some level of advertising spending—that a high-quality firm can profitably do that
would not be profitable for a low-quality firm to imitate. That is, there will always be some
value of _A_ that separates a high-quality firm from a low-quality one and that, therefore,
consumers can use the level of advertising as an accurate signal indicating they are buying
a high-quality product. For instance, suppose that _X_ = one million, _α_ = 0.25, and the
discount factor is _R_ = 0.9 (corresponding to an interest rate of about 11 percent). Then an
advertising budget of a little over $10 million (but less than $19 million) will do the trick.

The important point to note about Nelson’s (1970, 1974) insight is that the advertising
itself does not have to contain much information. It is simply the fact that the firm is
spending $ _A_ on advertising that provides the signal. The underlying intuition behind this
result should be clear. Advertising is an investment and the payoff to that investment
depends critically on the number of repeat customers a firm obtains. It is precisely because
high-quality firms win more repeat business that they can afford to make a more sizable
advertising investment. In turn, it is precisely the fact that only high-quality firms can afford
heavy advertising expenses that consumers can use that expense itself (and not the actual
information content) as a signal of high quality.

Nelson’s (1970, 1974) insight is important. Yet it is worth noting that Nelson’s original
work makes some important but not always explicit assumptions and its conclusion does
not always survive changes in those assumptions. For example, the illustrative model above
assumed that the price-cost margin was the same regardless of product quality, but this
might not be the case as Schmalensee (1978) early demonstrated. For example, it may that
a high-quality pain reliever can be produced at a cost of twenty cents per dosage while
a worthless pain reliever costs only a penny per dose to make. Then a firm offering the


528 Non-Price Competition


worthless painkiller may find that it can earn a very high markup on a very large volume
even if no repeat purchases occur—enough to justify a heavy advertising campaign if that
is what it takes to persuade first-time consumers that the product is high-quality. Again
though, if low-quality firms find it worthwhile to advertise as much as high-quality ones
do, then the signaling ability of advertising is lost.

Some further difficulties are also worth noting. Perhaps the most obvious of these is that
if advertising expense really is an indicator of product quality, then we should observe
firms simply announcing their advertising expenditures. That they do not suggests that the
model has some important limitations. In addition, there is the fact that Nelson’s (1970,
1974) model really applies best to so-called experience goods. Many well-known goods
though such as a Ralph Lauren _Polo_ shirt or a pair of Calvin Klein jeans can be tried on
and inspected for fit, comfort, and appearance before purchase. Thus, they qualify more as
search goods. Nevertheless, both firms advertise these products heavily contrary to what
Nelson’s (1970, 1974) analysis suggests.

Further, to the extent that Nelson’s model applies to experience goods as a general
category, it should apply to such goods regardless of the type of buyer. Yet in practice,
advertising expenditure-to-sales ratios are markedly higher for experience goods that are
marketed to consumers than for those that are marketed instead to other firms, i.e.,
intermediate or producer goods. Even within the consumer goods category advertising
expenditures are also relatively high for search goods as well as experience goods.

Despite its limitations, the possible role for advertising as a quality signal is nevertheless
a very important insight. Nelson’s (1970, 1974) papers were among the first to raise this
issue and, more generally, the problem firms face in trying to communicate credibly with
consumers. As a result, this issue has generated much investigative research. [14]

Among the more important papers in this literature are those by Kihlstrom and Riordan
(1984) and Milgrom and Roberts (1986). Kihlstrom and Riordan (1984) develop a twoperiod model in which a firm’s advertising alone in the first period determines whether
consumers believe the good to be a high- or low-quality product. Given consumer beliefs
about quality, prices are then determined in a traditional demand and supply manner. The
important result of the Kihlstrom and Riordan (1984) study is that they too find a strong
incentive for high-quality producers to lure “repeat buyers” by advertising heavily in the
first period, just as Nelson (1970 and 1974) found in his earlier analysis. The contribution
of Milgrom and Roberts (1986) is to show that pricing can serve as a quality signal as well
as advertising can. If both advertising and pricing can indicate quality though, the extent
to which either is used is complicated. Using a high price to signal quality is a cheaper
alternative for the firm than advertising, with the result that the Milgrom and Roberts (1986)
paper weakens the theoretical link between advertising and product quality. The Milgrom
and Roberts signaling model is, however, a monopoly or single firm model. Fluet and
Garella (2001) show instead that when the firm competes in price with other firms it may
be necessary to use advertising, and not price, to signal quality.

The large volume of papers on the signaling theory of advertising and prices has generated
empirical research as well. In general, this research has tried to provide evidence on the
extent to which the quality of a good is linked with the manufacturer’s advertising-to-sales
ratio, or price. Of course, one obvious issue is that the task of empirically measuring quality
is far from easy. The truth is that quality has many dimensions and it is not clear how to
combine the many dimensions into a single index. Nevertheless, broad rankings of product

Advertising, Market Power, and Information 529


quality are regularly published by Consumers Union. An important early study using this
data was done by Reisz (1978) on over 10,000 brands of 685 products. He found, however,
only a weak correlation between price and product quality.

If high prices do not necessarily signal high quality, what about advertising? Kotowitz
and Mathewson (1986) examined this relationship for both automobiles and whole-life
insurance. They did not, however, find evidence that the higher the advertising the better the
deal. Similarly, Archibald, Haulman, and Moody (1983) examined running shoes and again
found that neither price nor advertising levels for 187 brands were strongly correlated with
the quality rankings, which were published in the magazine _Runner’s World_ . However,
these authors did find that the magazine’s quality ratings, once publicized and circulated,
were very positively correlated with the extent of advertising done _after_ those rankings were
published. Firms with a high ranking were anxious to let consumers know this fact, while
those with a low ranking were less interested in displaying their product’s deficiencies. [15]

A study of 196 different industries by Caves and Green (1996) finds few discernible
tendencies in the relationship between advertising and brand quality. For many industries,
these authors find that the quality-advertising expenditure correlation approaches a negative
one—the exact opposite of Nelson’s prediction. They do, however, find a positive relationship between advertising and quality in the case of new or innovative goods. They also find
a weaker but still positive correlation between advertising and the quality of those goods in
their sample that might be called “experience goods.” The Caves and Green evidence on
Nelson’s hypothesis may then be best described as mixed.


_Non-Informative Informative Advertising_


As noted above, an attractive feature of the signaling view of advertising is that the
advertising itself does not need to include any obvious or specific information. It is
the fact of advertising itself that communicates product quality. This part of the theory
definitely does find confirmation in the data. Much advertising seems to leave out important
information such as price, quality of materials used, and so on. An alternative approach
to the information content of advertising that offers a different explanation for this lack of
advertising content has been offered by Anderson and Renault (2006). We explore their
argument briefly, here.

The Anderson and Renault (2006) model starts by recognizing that once the consumer
has traveled to a particular store, that travel cost is sunk. This can lead to a so-called
“hold-up” problem for consumers. Recall the 1990s fad of Beanie Babies. Suppose that
different consumers value the Beanie Babies differently. Some are willing to pay $25 for
_Crunch the Shark_ whereas others do not value _Crunch_ at all. Instead, they prefer _Chilly the_
_Polar Bear_ . If there are any transport costs, a retailer that advertises that it is selling _Crunch_
_the Shark_ will only attract the first group. Hence, the dealer may prefer to advertise that it
has Beanie Babies in general and suppress the information that its inventory is _Crunch_ in
particular. The retailer knows—and consumers know that it knows—that anyone coming
to the store and asking for _Crunch the Shark_ values _Crunch_ at $25. Because the transport
cost is sunk at that point, the retailer will have a strong incentive to “hold up” consumers
and charge them the full $25—ultimately deterring such buyers from responding to an ad.

Somewhat more formally, let there be three consumer types, 1, 2, and 3, and let us now
just consider a relatively generic good called widgets that comes in three colors, red, blue,


15 Note that _Runner’s World_ allows manufacturers to quote their rankings in advertisements.


530 Non-Price Competition


and yellow. Consumer type 1 values red widgets at $40, yellow widgets at $20, and blue
widgets at $15. Type 2 values red widgets at $15, yellow widgets at $40, and blue widgets
at $20. For type 3, the respective valuations are $20, $15, and $40. The willingness to pay
values for each consumer (which all consumers know) are shown in the Table 19.1 below.

We assume that each consumer also incurs a transport cost of $5.01 to visit the store. Once
a consumer actually visits a store, that transport cost is sunk. In the absence of knowledge
of a store’s actual stock, consumers rightfully believe that a store is equally likely to have
either red, yellow, or blue widgets. Hence, if consumers know only that a store has widgets,
they infer a probability of one-third that the store has widgets of any specific color. To keep
things really simple, we also assume that the store incurs zero cost per widget.

Consider two advertising strategies for a store that has only red widgets. The store can
advertise that it has red widgets or the store can advertise simply that it has widgets. Which
strategy will the store prefer? First observe that the store will never set a widget price below
$15, the minimum valuation of any consumer. Now consider the first strategy of advertising
that the store has only red widgets. If the retailer does this, consumer types 2 and 3 will not
come to the store. The $5.01 in transport cost will mean that the effective price for them
will never be less than $20.01. So, it is not worthwhile for either of these two types to come.
Of course, the store knows this, too. So, if it advertises its “Red Widgets” alone, it knows
that the only buyers who show up are type 1 consumers. Because, for these consumers, the
$5.01 in transport cost is a sunk cost once they are at the store, the owner can then charge
them their full willingness-to-pay of $40 for the widgets. Foreseeing this outcome, type 1
consumers will not respond to a red widget advertisement either. Advertising that the store
only has red widgets will therefore not attract customers at all.

However, if the shop announces that it simply has widgets in general, consumers can
reason as follows. Faced with a crowd of all consumer types but not knowing who is who,
the shopkeeper will set a price of $15 per widget. This will permit the store to sell one
(red) widget to each type and earn a profit of $45 from each threesome rather than set a
price of $40 and sell only to one type or a price of $20 and sell to types 1 and 3 (each
of which yields profit of $40 per threesome). Moreover, because consumers infer that the
probability associated with each color is one-third, all three types will in fact respond to the
ad by showing up at the store knowing that when this happens, the store owner will keep
the price at $15. Consumer _i_ will work out that for a price of $15 and a transport cost of
$5.01, consumer _i_ will receive either a red, yellow, or blue widget (each with probability
0.3333) whose value therefore is: 0.3333 _(_ $40 + $20 + 15 _)_ = $25, implying a net value of
$5 regardless of what consumer _i_ ’s most preferred type is.

There are a number of features of the foregoing outcome worth noting. First, the store
suppresses some information in its advertising. Specifically, it does not reveal that its
inventory is just red widgets. The store also does not need to mention the price in its ads.
Consumers can work out that the profit-maximizing price to set is $15. It is the presence


**Table 19.1** Consumer type


_Consumer 1_ _Consumer 2_ _Consumer 3_


Widget Type Red $40 $15 $20
Yellow $20 $40 $15
Blue $15 $20 $40


Advertising, Market Power, and Information 531


of a variety of consumer types—due to precisely the vagueness of the advertisement—that
supports this outcome. Because some of the consumers attracted to the store do not value red
widgets very highly, the storeowner is motivated to keep the price low. We have a market
outcome in which advertising deliberately does not mention either the specific attributes of
the product for sale or its price.

Perhaps most surprising of all, the suppression of this informational content can raise
welfare. To see this, observe that advertising red widgets led to a complete breakdown of
the market whereas advertising widgets in general leads to trades from which everyone
potentially can gain. [16] In other words, a law requiring full disclosure by the retailer would
make things worse.

Ellison and Ellison (2005) present a somewhat related argument regarding search engines
on the web. In principle, search engines increase the competitive pressure on Internet firms.
Moreover, the search engine can claim for itself some of the profit that would have gone
to the firm in return for providing consumers with the relevant price information. Thus, an
e-commerce company has some reason to thwart the search engine even though it may like
the fact that the search engine or shopbot brings customers to its site. It can do this in a
variety of ways. For example, it can list a low product price that the search engine sees but
charge a very high transport price that the search engine does not see, or similarly offer only
very slow delivery. Again, once the consumer has invested in the search cost and arrived
at the firm’s website, the firm may find that it can charge the consumer a very high price
for the product that the consumer really wants, e.g., one with quick delivery. Here again,
e-tailers are happy to list some information to entice the search engine but simultaneously
to keep too much information from being revealed.

The point is then that advertising can play a useful role even when its information content
is limited. In fact, it can do so even when firms deliberately suppress or obscure some of the
information content. Such strategic choices enable firms to attract—and to serve—a wider
range of customers than they would get if they offered complete information, and this may
be necessary for the market to function at all.


_Advertising, Information, and Price Competition_


While much advertising may contain little concrete information, there is also no denying
that a good bit of advertising _is_ informative. Newspapers and magazines are filled with ads
announcing sales, television commercials for cars typically mention explicit financing/lease
terms and fuel mileage, airlines’ and hotels’ Internet spots mention availability and price,
and this list does not even include the many informative advertisements in trade magazines.
Moreover, even advertisements that do not include such explicit information serve the
purpose of making the consumer aware of the product. As a result, advertising can be
directly informative to consumers about the existence and features of alternative goods.
Because it is difficult for a seller to sell a product at a high price when consumers are
aware that a perfect or at least a good substitute may be available, truly informative
advertising can be a highly useful and pro-consumer force that works to intensify market
competition.

To see formally how advertising can intensify price compeition we consider the Grossmand and Shapiro (1984) reworking of the spatial Bertrand model of Chapter 10. Let there


16 Not counting (sunk) transport costs, all consumers and the seller are better off in the limited information
equilibrium. Including sunk costs, type 2 consumers are (trivially) worse off but the gains for all other
participants are enough that these consumers could be compensated while others would still be better off.


532 Non-Price Competition


be two rival firms each located at either end of a unit long segment with a uniformly
distributed population of _N_ potential consumers. Each consumer will buy at most one unit
of the good if their willingness to pay _V_ exceeds the lowest price _pi_ plus transport cost _t_
(per unit of distance) that they must pay to obtain it and if they know of that purchasing
opportunity. Unlike that earlier model, however, we will assume that such knowledge is
not complete. In particular, for each firm there is a fraction of the _N_ consumers _si_ who are
only partially informed in that they know only of firm _i_ ’s product. There is also a fraction
_Sij_ of fully informed consumers that knows of both products. Clearly, this latter fraction
is the same for both firms, i.e., _S_ 12 _S_ 21. For simplicity, we will extend this symmetry
to the fraction that knows only of one firm’s product so that we also have: = _s_ 1 _s_ 2. In
addition, we note the condition that 0 _< si_ _Sij_ 1, which implies also that 0 _< s_ = _j_ 1
and 0 _< Sij_ 1, as well as the fact that if + _s_ i _(S_ ≤ _ij)_ 1, then _Sij(s_ i _)_ 0. In other words, ≤
because the shares of either partially or fully informed consumers can never be negative, ≤ = =
if one is unity the other must be zero. The _siN_ partially informed consumers and the _SijN_
fully informed consumers are also assumed to be uniformly distributed over the interval
separating the two firms. Finally, each firm has a constant marginal cost _c_ per unit.

We will assume that each consumer’s willingness to pay _V_ for the most preferred
version of the good is reasonably high such that each firm has a captive demand of _siN_
from its partially informed consumer base. These consumers will buy from their preferred
retailer even if it does not have the lowest (net-of-travel-cost) price. However, the firm also
confronts a group of _SijN_ fully informed consumers who will only buy from the firm with
the lowest price plus transport cost. We know from our work in Chapter 10 that for this
group, the marginal consumer who is just indifferent between buying from either firm 1



or firm 2, has location (measuring from left (west) to right (east)) of _x_ _[M]_ _[p]_ [2][ −] _[p]_ [1][ +] _[ t]_

Hence, for firm 1 located at the left or western end of the segment, total demand is

It is easy to verify that when the entire market is fully informed so that _S_ 12 1 and
_s_ 1 _s_ 2 0, equation (19.17) implies an equilibrium price of _p_ _c_ _t_, exactly as found =
in Chapter 10. It is equally easy to see that as = = _S_ 12 falls below this value, the equilibrium = +
price rises. [17] The underlying intuition is also straightforward. Firms compete for the fully
informed consumers but charge the same mill price to all. As more consumers become fully
informed, each firm has a greater incentive to lower its price a bit and win more of this
larger market share. Hence, the greater the proportion of potential consumers who know
of both products and can therefore do comparison shopping, the more intense the price
competition grows.

Advertising is of course a way for firms to inform consumers of their products. Indeed,
each firm must advertise if it is to reach any consumers at all. Therein lies the rub. Each
firm needs to advertise if any consumers are to be informed either partially or fully. Yet
neither firm can be sure that its advertisements will simply reach those consumers who are
unaware of the rival’s products. To the contrary, the greater the effort each makes to reach
some consumers, the more likely it becomes that an important segment of the market is
aware of both goods and it is competition over that segment that drives the equilibrium
price progressively lower.

In the Appendix, we present a simple version of the foregoing model in which firms
choose their advertising effort as reflected in the fraction of consumers they try to reach
as well as select their profit-maximizing price. The general point should be clear, though.
To the extent that advertising does provide consumers with information about alternative
products, it tends to intensify price competition to the benefit of the consumer. Note,
however, that this does not mean that the market becomes more competitively structured
or that more firms enter the market. Quite to the contrary, the intensified price competition
that advertising induces can easily serve to limit entry and to foster a more concentrated
industry.

While we noted the potentially negative anti-competitive effects that early researchers
such as Bain (1956) found, the fact is that there is much empirical evidence to support
the view that advertising prices and retail locations intensifies price competition. Early on,
Telser (1964) showed that greater advertising intensity was associated with more volatility
in market shares, leading him to conclude that advertising promoted competition. More
explicitly, Benham (1972) showed that the average price of eyeglasses was significantly


17 If _S_ 12 gets very small, the price is limited by consumers’ maximum willingness to pay _V_ . The GrossmanShapiro (1984) is just one model of advertising and consumer search. Others include: Stigler (1968),
Butters (1977), and Clark and Horstmann (2005).


534 Non-Price Competition


higher in states where advertising the prices and retail locations of opticians’ services was
prohibited. Similar price effects when advertising is restricted were found by Cady (1976)
in the market for prescription drugs. [See Milyo and Waldfoget (1995) for related evidence
from the retail liquor industry.]

Glazer’s (1981) study of the New York City newspaper strike provides three connected
but chronologically distinct bits of the pro-competitive role of advertising. That strike,
which ran for nearly three months starting in August, 1978 shut down each of the three
major New York City newspapers, _The New York Times_, _The New York Post_, and _The Daily_
_News_, and thereby greatly reduced the access that city residents had to any advertising
of supermarket food prices. However, within a few weeks of the strike’s beginning, a
number of interim papers emerged that potentially filled this informative role, although

their circulation was much smaller. These events make for a natural comparison with nearby
Nassau County on Long Island, which suffered no real break in the publication of its local
newspapers. Glazer (1981) therefore compares the food prices in Queens (one of the New
York’s five boroughs) with those in neighboring Nassau county over each of three periods:
1) the early part of the strike when Queens residents had little food price information; 2) the
latter part of the strike when Queens residents had some information from interim papers;
and 3) the post-strike period when Queens residents were once again presumably as well
informed about local food prices as were residents in neighboring Nassau. The basic results
were that food prices rose about 3.4 percent _more_ in Queens during the first period; rose
no further during the second period; and then rose 8 percent _less_ than Nassau prices in the
last period. In other words, the basic pattern was that Queens’ food prices became more
competitively priced relative to Nassau prices the more advertising information Queens
residents had.

More recently, two closely related papers by Slade (1995) and Pinkse and Slade (2007)
analyze the joint advertising and pricing decisions of rival supermarket firms. Focusing on
saltine crackers, Slade (1995) finds that each supermarket tends to advertise more when
its rivals raise their price and, conversely, that each tends to cut its price in response to a
rise in rivals’ advertising. Both effects suggest that advertising fosters price competition.
Working with the same data, Pinkse and Slade (2007) find that the advertising effort is
complementary to price reductions, i.e., firms advertise more heavily to spread the word
about a recent reduction in price. This too suggests a pro-competitive effect for advertising
although the longer-run dynamics are more complicated as rivals respond to these strategic
choices. Relatedly, Nevo (2001) shows that advertising plays a key competitive role in the
ready-to-eat breakfast cereal market.


19.5 ADVERTISING: COMPLEMENTS, COORDINATION,
AND INDUSTRY DYNAMICS


In this section we offer some further considerations regarding how advertising works and its
impact on industry outcomes. One possibility—raised early by Stigler and Becker (1977)
but presented more formally by Becker and Murphy (1993)—is that advertising works
because consumers value it as a complement to the advertised good. An analogy that Becker
and Murphy (1993) use is that advertising is much like the television or newspaper coverage
of a local sports team. The report of a game’s outcome and recap of the key events may
neither change consumers’ tastes, as in the persuasive view, nor add useful information
(especially to those who were at the game), as in the informative view. Nevertheless, such
coverage raises consumer interest in and demand for attending team games.

In the Becker and Murphy (1993) view, advertising can work in this same complementary
way to raise the demand for the advertised good. Of course, informative advertising can act
as a complement as well. The value of the Becker and Murphy (1993) approach is that this
conceptualization makes it easy—at least in theory—to work out whether or not advertising
is excessive without any need to worry about whether to use pre- or post-advertising
demand curves. The question boils down to whether the extra value that advertising brings
to consumers plus the extra profit it brings to producers (all at the margin) covers the
advertising marginal cost. In this respect, it is entirely possible that advertising may work
to raise the elasticity of the firm’s demand. If so, then as the total amount of the advertised


536 Non-Price Competition


good that is sold rises, the price must fall because _(p_ - _c)/p_ = 1 _/εP_ is a necessary condition
for profit maximization. In turn, Becker and Murphy show that this implies there will be
_too little_ advertising as it means that the advertiser will not take the greater product value
that consumers get from the product into account in deciding how much advertising to do.

Pastine and Pastine (2002) offer a different role for advertising in markets where each
consumer wants to purchase the same brand as most other consumers. In such markets, there
are network effects (see Chapter 22) that reflect an externality on the demand side—the more
people that buy a specific brand, the more valuable that brand is to each consumer. Network
markets are typically characterized by multiple equilibria and some equilibria—often those
in which all or virtually all consumers purchase the same brand—raise welfare higher than
other equilibria. In their model then advertising plays a useful, welfare-enhancing role even
though it does not change consumer tastes, provide information, or serve as a complement
to the good itself. Instead, advertising is helpful because it can serve as a device for
coordinating consumer purchasing decisions. With each consumer forming the expectation
that the brand other consumers will buy will be the one that is most heavily advertised, that
expectation can become self-fulfilling and therefore rational. On the supplier side, Pastine
and Pastine (2002) assume a duopoly model in which each firm chooses its advertising
level for two periods with one firm choosing in period _t_ and the rival choosing in period
_t_ + 1. This means that in any specific period, one firm’s advertising is pre-set while the
rival gets to re-set its choice from two periods earlier. The firm that is free to choose its
advertising in any period then has an incentive to out-advertise its rival precisely because
consumers are using that advertising to coordinate their decisions—thereby reinforcing the
self-fulfilling expectational equilibrium. This leads to interesting dynamics over time as an
advertising war breaks out in which each firm increases its advertising every two periods
until a maximum is reached. At that point it becomes worthwhile to reduce the advertising
effort back to a low level from which the process can start all over again. The model also
helps to explain why much advertising is directed at young people for whom peer pressure
and “being in” may be most important.

Finally, a recent article by Dinlersoz and Yorukoglu (2012) builds on the point made at
the beginning of this chapter that breakthroughs in information technology and the ability
to reach consumers with advertising can have a dramatic effect on the evolution of an
industry. In their model, firms advertise prices and more efficient firms can advertise lower
prices. As a result, more efficient firms grow in size and less efficient firms shrink and exit.
(Firm growth is therefore _not_ independent of firm size in contrast to the assumption of
the Gibrat process discussed in Chapter 12.) Because consumers tend to repurchase from
firms from which they recently bought, relatively more efficient firms will also tend to
win more repeat sales and therefore become relatively larger firms over time. Hence, their
model predicts a positive relation between a firm’s advertising effort and its size as noted
earlier in this chapter. More importantly, when there is a decline in the cost of advertising,
e.g., the information revolution reflected in the rapid extension of the Internet, information
dissemination will accelerate to the benefit of the most efficient firms with the result that
concentration will increase even as price competition intensifies. Dinlersoz and Yorukoglu
(2012) present evidence that this is exactly what has happened in industries with significant
web-based sales, such as bookstores, camera and photo stores, and travel agents. Apart
from providing a rich description of market evolution, the Dinlersoz and Yorukoglu (2012)

study serves again to remind us that market structure is endogenous and not necessarily a
good proxy for the intensity of price competition. [18]


19.6 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: ADVERTISING, INFORMATION,
AND PRESTIGE


There has been considerable debate over the role that advertising plays in influencing
consumer demand. Advertising could offer basic information, signal quality, or provide a
complementary aspect of social status or prestige to the advertised product. While important
insights come from exploring each of these approaches, the question of advertising’s actual
role may be ultimately an empirical one. It is difficult, however, to come up with good
clean empirical evidence that identifies the nature of advertising’s role. A paper by Daniel
Ackerberg (2001), though, does offer some interesting and promising results.

Ackerberg’s (2001) paper studies the introduction of a new yogurt product by Yoplait, the
second largest yogurt firm in the United States. In April of 1987, the company introduced
_Yoplait 150_ as its first entry into the low-calorie and low-fat yogurt product line. This
period falls within the time frame of data collected by the A. C. Nielsen Co. for just under
2,000 households split roughly evenly between Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Springfield,
Missouri. That data included scanner readings used to monitor the shopping trips and
purchases of these households. It also included recordings from TV meters installed in the
consumers’ homes that allowed Nielsen to monitor their television viewing and, hence,
their exposure to _Yoplait 150_ advertising over the twelve months starting three months after
the _Yoplait 150_ introduction, i.e., from July of 1987 to July of 1988. Thus, the data are a
panel of observations covering consumers in two cities at weekly intervals over a one-year
period.

Ackerberg (2001) considers two broad effects that advertising could have. The first of
these is an information effect. Advertising may either inform consumers of the good’s
existence, as in Grossman and Shapiro (1984), or signal quality or other information about
the product’s attributes, as in Nelson (1970) and Kihlstrom and Riordan (1984). In contrast,
the Becker and Murphy (1993) model of complementary advertising and the advertising as
persuasion models suggest that the role of advertising is not informative but instead one that
confers a separate recognition or prestige effect of its own. Ackerberg (2001) argues that
if advertising plays an informational role then it should have little effect on experienced
consumers. This is particularly the case if the relevant information is simply about the
existence and availability of the good. Once a consumer has bought it, they presumably
know these facts so further advertising exposure will have no impact on them if, of course,
this is the way advertising works.

This is also true but to a lesser extent if the information is about the quality of the product.
_Yoplait 150_, for example, came out in many different flavors. It may take consumers a
few tries to determine whether there is a flavor that they really like or not. In this case,
advertising about alternative flavors will still have some effect on consumers over time,


18 Bagwell and Ramey (1994) derive a similar outcome when the demand-raising effects of advertising
permit scale economies and so lower prices even as concentration rises. All these studies on advertising
and industry dynamics recall the critical work of Sutton (1991).


538 Non-Price Competition


but one that should definitely diminish as they become more experienced with the product.
However, if advertising confers a recognition effect then there should be little distinction
between its impact on experienced and inexperienced consumers. The complementary
gains in consuming a well-recognized product should, on average, be the same whether a
consumer is enjoying it for the first time or the tenth.

Ackerberg (2001) hopes to identify the role of advertising by distinguishing between its
effects on experienced and inexperienced buyers. Two preliminary ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions suggest that this strategy may work. In these regressions, he looks at
the total _Yoplait 150_ purchases over specific days in his sample and then divides these into
two types. In one group are the sales that reflect first-time purchases. In the other group,
are the sales that reflect repeat purchases, each measured as a fraction of the number of
shopping trips that day. Ackerberg (2001) then creates separate time series of first-time
sales and repeat sales on specific market days over the twelve-month period. For each of
those making either a first or a repeat purchase, Ackerberg (2001) also has data on the
average _Yoplait 150_ price for each market day (PRICE), and, for each purchase, the number
of _Yoplait 150_ TV ads the buyer was exposed to in the last four days (ADS). Because
Yoplait _150_ generally sold much better in Springfield, he also includes a dummy variable
(MARKET) equal to 1 if the data are from Springfield but 0 if they are from Sioux Falls.
These preliminary results are shown in Table 19.2 below:

Observe first that the price effects are negative and statistically significant. Likewise,
there is clearly a stronger preference for _Yoplait 150_ in Springfield than there is in Sioux
Falls. Of most importance, however, is the differential effect of advertising on the two types
of expenditures. Recent advertising exposure has a far greater positive effect on first-time
buyers of _Yoplait 150_ . In fact, the effect on repeat purchases is not statistically significant
from zero. Thus, this evidence gives rough support to the idea that advertising provides
information in that it has little effect on experienced consumers who, presumably already
know of the existence and quality (taste) of _Yoplait 150_ .

To get a deeper understanding of the role that advertising plays, Ackerberg (2001)
exploits more fully the panel nature of his data and the variation among consumers that
this implies. His approach, with some simplification, is to hypothesize that the propensity
of consumer _i_ in period _t_ to purchase _Yoplait 150_ ( _yit_ [∗][) is a linear function of] _[ k]_ [ different]

exogenous variables _Xit_ and a random factor _εit_ . That is
