firm _i_ requires one unit of capacity input _K_ and one unit of a variable input _L_ . These are
available at the cost of _r_ and _w_ per unit, respectively.

The game has two stages. In the first stage, the incumbent makes an initial capacity
choice _K_ 1 ~~.~~ The incumbent’s capacity can be further increased in stage two of the game but
cannot be reduced.

The potential entrant observes the incumbent’s stage one capacity choice and makes its
entry decision in stage two. It is only after that observation that the potential entrant makes its
entry decision in stage two. If entry occurs then stage two is characterized by simultaneous
quantity competition. Market demand in stage two is described by _P_ _A_ _(q_ 1 _q_ 2 _)_ . Both
firms simultaneously choose both outputs _(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ and their _final_ capacity levels = - + _(K_ 1 _, K_ 2 _)_
in stage two. For the incumbent, however, _K_ 1 _K_ 1. Hence, the incumbent’s cost function
in stage two of the game: ≥


_C_ 1 _(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _K_ 1 _)_ _F_ 1 _wq_ 1 _rK_ 1 for _q_ 1 _K_ 1
; = + + ≤ ;

= _F_ 1 + _(w_ + _r)q_ 1 _,_ for _q_ 1 _> K_ 1; (12.A1)

The entrant makes no initial capacity investment in stage one. Hence, its cost function in
stage two is:


_C_ 2 _(q_ 2 _)_ _F_ 2 _(w_ _r)q_ 2 (12.A2)
= + + ;

implying a constant marginal cost of _w_ + _r_ at all levels of production.

The incumbent firm’s operating profit (revenue less variable cost) in stage 2 is:


_π_ 1 _(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _, K_ 1 _)_ [ _A_ _(q_ 1 _q_ 2 _)_ ] _q_ 1 _wq_ 1 for _q_ 1 _K_ 1 (12.A3a)
=       - +       - ≤


_π_ 1 _(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _, K_ 1 _)_ = [ _A_  - _(q_ 1 + _q_ 2 _)_ ] _q_ 1 − _wq_ 1 − _r(q_ 1− _K_ 1 _)_ for _q_ 1 _> K_ 1 (12.A3b)

Maximizing either (12.A13a) or (12.A3b) with respect to _q_ 1 yields the incumbent’s best
response function:

# **13** **Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments**

At one level, predatory actions can be conceptually divided into two classifications: those
aimed at preventing potential rivals from entering a market, and those aimed at driving
existing rivals out of a market. Our discussion in Chapter 12 was largely framed in terms of
the first of these categories, i.e., deterrence of potential rivals from entering. Yet it should
be clear that while these two categories are conceptually distinct, in actual practice it is very
difficult to distinguish them. Tactics used to prevent entry will often be identical to tactics
that drive existing rivals to exit. Bundling may be a useful entry-deterring tactic. Yet it
was the devastating effect on its actual rival Netscape that raised concern over Microsoft’s
bundling _Internet Explorer_ with its _Windows_ operating system. Indeed, from the 1911
_Standard Oil_ case on, the vast bulk of antitrust litigation over predatory behavior has
centered on cases alleging that a dominant firm abused its power to drive out competitors.

There are at least two reasons that the legal history surrounding charges of predatory
behavior is so heavily dominated by cases alleging efforts of one firm to drive its rivals out
of business rather than to prevent them from entering in the first place. One is that to be
effective, entry deterrence requires credibility. When a firm operates in many markets or
faces a number of potential entrants over time in a single market, it may be necessary (and
worthwhile) to take on the expense of driving an existing rival from the market in order to
establish its commitment to defend its market and thereby discourage any further entry.

A second and perhaps even more important reason, is that to accuse a firm of predatory
behavior is to charge it with a criminal offense. Such a charge is a lot easier to prosecute
when there is an actual victim whose losses are demonstrable rather than a potential victim
whose losses may appear to be merely hypothetical. Yet this motivation also serves to
point out a risk in using legal action to address claims of predatory tactics. As the data
reviewed in Chapter 12 demonstrate, the truth is that life on the corporate battlefield is
tough, and many firms will fail not because of predation but because they are inefficient,
and/or produce low quality products. In considering claims of predation therefore, we must
recognize the motivation that any unsuccessful firm has to claim that its failure is due to
“bad” behavior on the part of a rival rather than its own incompetence. Accordingly, we
must pay some attention to the conditions under which predatory actions to drive existing
rivals out of business are truly rational if we want to separate instances of true predation
from cases in which an inefficient firm is simply blaming someone else for its failure.

The most commonly alleged predation aimed at eliminating existing rivals is pricing
below cost with a view to raising prices later when the competition has left. Supreme Court


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 317


Justice Louis Brandeis, a member of the _Standard Oil_ court, was a particularly eloquent
exponent of this theory of “predatory pricing.” Brandeis warned in 1913 that:


“Americans should be under no illusion as to the value of price-cutting. It is the most potent
weapon of monopoly—a means of killing the small rival to which the great trusts have resorted
most frequently. Far-seeing organized capital secures by this means the cooperation of the
shortsighted consumer to his own undoing. Thoughtless or weak, he yields to the temptation
of trifling immediate gain; and selling his birthright for a mess of pottage, becomes himself an
instrument of monopoly.” [1]


That the predatory pricing scenario Brandeis feared sometimes happens is largely beyond
doubt. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Mogul Steamship Company appears
to have maintained its market power in trade with China by quoting shipping rates so
low that rivals were forced from the business. [2] Likewise, the American Sugar Refining
Company, also known as the Sugar Trust, responded to any significant entry attempt with
a price war that drove the sugar price below cost. At the same time, it must be recognized
that the logic of dynamic games emphasized earlier—and particularly the requirement for
subgame perfection—casts some doubt on the rationality of the predatory pricing strategy.
The predator’s rival must somehow be convinced of the predator’s commitment to pursue
the tactic in order to induce the rival to exit. Even if the rival does leave, then what? Any
attempt by the predator to raise prices may well attract new rivals, negating the whole
purpose of the predation. For this reason, more recent charges of predatory pricing against
modern firms such as Wal-Mart, [3] AT&T, [4] Toyota and Mazda, [5] and American Airlines
have provoked skeptical responses.

This chapter follows the work of Chapter 12 by further investigating strategies aimed
at limiting the number of rivals. Because of its prominence, we start with the debate
over predatory pricing. Thereafter, we investigate the logic of predation more deeply and,
in particular, focus on the credible commitment that predation requires. As it turns out,
information, specifically “who knows what,” plays a key role in predatory behavior. To
understand predatory strategies, it is important to examine very carefully the information
that each player has about the other players and about the market. We therefore start with
a careful analysis of the predatory pricing argument. We examine both its basic intuition
and whether that intuition meets the formal rationality requirements and, in particular, the
requirement of subgame perfection. We then consider variations of this theme and the
ideas developed in Chapter 12 on entry deterrence and inducing the exit of rivals. One key
difference between the strategies considered here and those analyzed in Chapter 12 is that
virtually all of the models analyzed in this chapter are set in an environment of imperfect
information so that the results of specific actions are uncertain _ex ante_ .

318 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


13.1 PREDATORY PRICING: MYTH OR REALITY?


For many economists, the term predatory pricing conjures up the image of John Rockefeller
and Standard Oil. The famed antitrust case against Standard Oil occurred at the turn of the
century. Between the years 1870 and 1899, Standard Oil built a dominant 90 percent market
share in the US petroleum refining industry. It did this by acquiring more than 120 rival
companies. The conventional story is that Rockefeller would first make an offer to acquire
a rival refiner and, when rebuffed, would cut prices until the rival exited the market. [6] After
achieving its market dominance in oil refining capacity and distribution, Standard raised
prices to oil producers. This eventually led to its federal prosecution and dissolution in 1911
under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.

On the face of it there seems little doubt that Standard Oil did engage in fierce price
competition with its rivals, and that rival firms in the refining business did leave the market.
There is some doubt, however, whether this is in fact evidence of _predatory_ pricing. Such
doubt has foundations in both theory and evidence. There are two arguments that imply
predatory pricing is not an optimal strategy, and therefore we should not expect a firm
to practice it. The first argument is basically that predatory pricing, as in the Chain Store
Paradox, is not subgame perfect.

To understand the power of this argument we will review the Microhard Newvel game
that we introduced in Chapter 11. However, we will add some new twists that make the
game more like the real world setting, facing a dominant incumbent firm such as Standard
Oil and a smaller rival. The game is again a two period one. Rather than a potential
entrant however, we will assume that the upstart Newvel has already entered the market
in period 1, but that Microhard—perhaps based on its long-established record in other
markets—nevertheless retains a first mover advantage in terms of deciding whether or not
to engage in predatory practices in this first period. One important new twist is that now
we assume that each firm incurs a fixed cost of $115 million in each market period. This
amount must be paid up front at the start of each period. Unlike Microhard, which has
internal retained earnings from its long experience in other markets, Newvel has no internal
funds. Therefore, Newvel must borrow such funds from a competitive banking sector.

Next we introduce some uncertainty into the market. Independent of Microhard’s actions,
there is a 50 percent chance in any period that Newvel will be successful and enjoy a
high operating profit of $200 million. There is also a 50 percent chance that it will not be
successful and earn a lower operating profit of $100 million. In the former case, Newvel’s
net profit for the period is $200 million less what it must pay to the bank for its loan. In
the second case, Newvel does not earn enough to repay even the loan’s principal of $115
million. As a result, Newvel will simply default and turn over the $100 million it earned to
the bank.

Because the banking sector is competitive, any bank should expect to earn roughly zero
profit on the loan it makes to Newvel. We assume that the discount factor _R_ between periods
is equal to one (the interest rate _r_ = 0). To earn zero profit, the bank, or more generally the
investor, must ask for a repayment of $130 million when Newvel’s operating profit is high
and $100 million when its profit is low. With such a contract, the bank will be paid $130


6 There is an extensive literature on the varied business practices used by Standard Oil during this period.
Other practices include securing discriminatory rail freight rates and rebates, foreclosing crude oil supplies
to competitors by buying up local pipelines, and allegedly blowing up competing pipelines. See Yergin
(1991).


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 319


million half of the time and $100 million the other half of the time when Newvel defaults.
On average, such a contract would result in the bank earning $115 million and hence just
covering its loan. To give the bank some incentive to take on the risk however, it may
need to do a bit better than this. So, we assume that it can demand a repayment of $132.5
million in the event that Newvel’s operating profit is high. This gives the bank an expected
net return of 0.5[$132.5 + $100] − $115 = $1.25 million each period. In contrast, Newvel
will either net _(_ $200 − $132.5 _)_ = $67.5 million with probability 0.5, or nothing, also with
probability 0.5. Hence, Newvel’s expected net income in any period is $33.75 million.

Now consider the incumbent Microhard. Suppose that in any period that Newvel is in
the market Microhard earns an operating profit of $150 million, but that it would earn a
monopoly profit of $325 million if Newvel exits. Suppose further that by cutting prices and
sacrificing $30 million of profit in any period, Microhard could raise the probability to 70
percent that Newvel is not successful and hence would earn only $100 million in that same
period. Will Microhard have an incentive to cut prices and worsen Newvel’s chances?

Let’s begin by analyzing the second period of the game. First, Microhard will not engage
in predation and cut prices in period two. As there is no “next period,” this would only
sacrifice profit with no prospect of recovering the loss at a later date. Hence, if Newvel stays
after the first round, the outcome in the last period has to be a duopoly in which each earns
an expected $150 million in operating or gross profit. Thus, regardless of what happened in
the first period Newvel will be able to get a loan for its fixed cost at the start of the second
period. Even if Newvel defaulted in the first period and the bank lost $15 million, Newvel
and the bank would still have an incentive to renegotiate another loan for the second period.
Because Microhard will not engage in predation, the bank has an expectation of earning
$1.25 million, which will at least help a little in covering its first period loss rather than not
making the loan and earning nothing. Similarly, Newvel can expect to earn $33.75 million.

Will Microhard engage in predation and try to drive Newvel out of the market in the
first period? Again the answer is no. No matter what happens in the first period, we know
that Newvel will want to stay for the second period. Hence, no amount of predation by
Microhard in the first period can prevent Newvel from operating in the second. Microhard
will recognize that Newvel intends to stay, in which case there is no reason to pursue
predatory pricing and lose revenue in the first period. Predation will not occur.


operating profit of $200 million falls to 40 percent. For a loan of $115 million, what would
be the contingent contract demanded by a bank in a competitive banking sector? In other
words, how much repayment would the bank demand when operating profits were high
and when they were low? Does the worsening of Newvel’s prospects affect Microhard’s
incentive to price low in the first period? Explain why or why not.


If the foregoing scenario is close to capturing the reality of the corporate battlefield, then
predatory tactics such as selling below cost don’t seem to make sense, and so should not
be observed in practice. The argument is even stronger than that just presented because we
simply assumed that if Microhard were somehow successful in driving out Newvel then
it would enjoy full monopoly power. Yet there is no reason to believe that a new rival




320 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


would not emerge at that time. If such later entry is a possibility, then there is even less for
Microhard to gain from predation.

Beyond the reasoning that predation is not a subgame perfect strategy, there is a second
argument implying that predatory strategies should not be used. This argument is credited to
the economist John McGee (1958, 1980) who reviewed the _Standard Oil_ case extensively
and argued that the firm was _not_ engaged in predation. In his classic 1958 article, “Predatory
Price Cutting: The Standard Oil Case,” McGee argued that predatory pricing only makes
sense if two conditions are met. The first is that the increase in post-predatory profit (in
present value terms) is sufficient to compensate the predator for the loss incurred during
the predatory price war. This amounts, of course, to a requirement that the predation be
subgame perfect. However, if this requirement were met, McGee also noted that there was
a second requirement that a predation strategy would have to meet. This is that there is
_no more profitable strategy_ to achieve the same outcome. It was this second point that
drew McGee’s attention. He argued that a merger is always more profitable than predatory
pricing. Hence, predatory pricing should not occur.

McGee’s reasoning is straightforward and can also be understood in a game theoretic
framework. Basically the point is that predatory pricing is a dominated strategy and hence,
one that will never be used. We can illustrate this point using the Stackelberg model. The
Stackleberg leader is the potential predator, and the follower is the intended prey. Suppose
that each firm has a constant average and marginal cost _c_ . The inverse market demand
andcurve is: _qF_ is the output of the follower. In Chapter 12 we found that the Nash equilibrium _P_ = _A_ - _BQ_ = _A_ - _B(qL_ + _qF )_ . Here, _qL_ is the output of the Stackelberg leader
outcome is _qL_ _(A_ _c)/_ 2 _B,_ and _qF_ _(A_ _c)/_ 4 _B,_ which leads to an industry price
_p_ = _(A_ + 3 _c)/_ =4. At this price, each firm earns a positive profit. The leader earns the profit − = _(A_ - _c)_ [2] _/_ 8 _B,_ while the follower earns half this amount. Large as it may be however, the
leader’s profit is still less than that earned by a pure monopolist, namely, _(A_ - _c)_ [2] _/_ 4 _B._

The leader would obviously prefer to be alone in the market. Let’s now allow for two
market periods, thus giving scope to the leader to engage in predatory behavior. All we
need to do is imagine that for the first market period the leader is fully committed to
producing an output so large that all of it can only be sold at a price just equal to its average
cost of _c_ . Because the follower can only sell additional units by driving the market price
below _c,_ and therefore losing money, the follower will exit or not enter. If we suppose that
this experience is enough to keep the follower out forever, it will mean that in the second
market period, the leader is now a monopolist and can set the monopoly price and earn the
monopoly profit, _(A_ - _c)_ [2] _/_ 4 _B._

Apart from the issue of subgame perfection, the trouble with this strategy, as McGee
pointed out, is that a better one is available. Under the predatory strategy just described,
the leader or predator earns a stream of profit of 0 in the first market period and then
_(A_ - _c)_ [2] _/_ 4 _B_ in the second. The follower or victim can look forward to a stream of 0 profit
in both periods. McGee’s point is that it would be more profitable for the leader to buy out
or merge with the follower at the start of the first period. The merged firms can then act
as a monopoly and earn the monopoly profit _(A_ - _c)_ [2] _/_ 4 _B_ in both market periods. Even
if the leader has to share its first period profit with the follower, say on a fifty-fifty basis,
_both_ firms still do better than they would under predation when both the predator and prey
earned a zero profit in period one. Because the second period profit is unchanged by the
merger, it seems clear that the merger strategy dominates the predatory one.


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 321


McGee’s (1958) argument that predation is a dominated strategy is straightforward
and compelling. Coupled with the possibility that predation may not be subgame perfect,
McGee’s analysis would seem to cast serious doubt on any allegation of predatory pricing.

However, there are some weaknesses in the McGee (1958) argument. To begin with,
any merger between rival firms is a public event. In particular, the antitrust authorities will
know about the merger and may easily file suit to prevent it. Indeed, the authorities may
well be more concerned about a merger than they would be about predatory pricing because
the merger would eliminate even the short, predatory period in which consumer prices are
low. A second, and perhaps more important, weakness in the logic of McGee’s merging
strategy arises when we extend the analysis to include additional potential entrants. Once
a dominant firm such as Standard Oil is seen as willing to buy out any rival, it will likely
face a stream of entrants who enter just for the profitability of being purchased. [7] That is,
the merger tactic may actually encourage entry—the last thing the dominant firm wishes to
do. In this light, predatory pricing may be more attractive because it not only encourages
existing rivals to exit but can deter subsequent entrants as well. [8]


Stackelberg leader. The other rival firm is the follower. The firms compete in quantities and
face market demand described by _P_ = 100 − _Q_ . Assume that marginal production cost is
constant and equal to 10.


a. Solve for the single market period equilibrium outcome, that is, the quantity produced
by each firm and the firms’ respective profits.
b. Now consider a two market period game. One possibility is that the two firms play the
Stackelberg game twice, once in each market period. The other possibility is that the
dominant firm chooses an output level so great in the first market period that the rival
firm exits the market or sells zero output. In the second market period the dominant
firm is alone in the market and acts like a monopoly. Solve for the dominant firm’s first
and second market period output choices under this scenario, and the firm’s overall
profit.
c. Suppose that we allow the dominant firm the option of making an offer to the rival firm
to buy it out at the beginning of the first market period. What is the maximum amount
the dominant firm will have to pay the rival firm to buy it out? Show that the dominant
firm is better off buying out its rival in the first period and monopolizing the market
through merging than through predation.


Although there are some qualifications to McGee’s reasoning, the existence of a less
costly alternative means of eliminating rivals and doubt about the credibility of predatory
pricing are two good reasons to be suspicious of rivals alleging predatory pricing by a


7 Rasmusen (2007) explores this possibility.
8 This point was made by Yamey (1972): “the aggressor will, moreover, be looking beyond the immediate
problem of dealing with its current rival. Alternative strategies for dealing with that rival may have different
effects on the flow of future rivals.”

dominant firm. There is also a third reason. As noted above, unsuccessful rivals always
have an incentive to claim that they are victims of predation rather than victims of their
own inefficiencies. Hence, claims of predation that come from failed rivals must be taken
with a grain of salt.

For example, consider the famous _Utah Pie_ [9] case decided by the US Supreme Court in
1967. Utah Pie was a producer of frozen dessert pies operating out of Salt Lake City and
selling to supermarkets in Utah and surrounding states. In 1957, it had over two-thirds of
the Salt Lake City market. However, three national firms—Continental Bakeries, Pet, and
Carnation—all began to compete vigorously in the Salt Lake City area. Over the next three
years, this resulted in prices falling by over a third and Utah Pie’s market share declining to
as low as 33 percent, though it later climbed to nearly 45 percent. Utah Pie filed suit arguing
that the three national firms were selling at prices in the Salt Lake City market below those
that they charged in other cities and that the three firms were therefore engaged in illegal
price discrimination with a predatory objective.

However, Utah Pie’s sales grew steadily throughout the period of alleged predation, as
did its net worth. Moreover, except for the first year of the intensified competition, Utah
Pie also continued to earn a positive net income. To many economists, it appeared that
Utah Pie’s real complaint was more about preserving its initial near monopoly position and
the high prices that monopoly power permitted, than it was about predatory tactics. In the
end, however, the Supreme Court found in favor of Utah Pie in a decision that was widely
decried and since then, largely repudiated. Yet the point remains. Company officials will
inevitably wish to claim that the cause of their profit and market share decline is illegal
activity by rivals who are “not playing fairly” rather than confess their own inefficiencies.
For that reason, charges of predatory pricing must be taken with at least a few grains of salt.

The deep skepticism that predation, especially predatory pricing, ever occurs is a view
closely associated with the Chicago School. This view has had a profound effect on both
public policy and court judgments regarding predatory pricing cases. However, over the
last twenty-five years or so, a new view—sometimes called the post-Chicago School—has
emerged. In this alternative view, while predation claims are rightly treated with caution,
there is no _a priori_ dismissal of such charges because it is recognized that predatory tactics
are not a theoretical impossibility and real world predation should not be viewed as an idle
threat.


13.2 PREDATION AND IMPERFECT INFORMATION


Much of the post-Chicago literature on the topic of predation is based on two period games in
which one firm knows something and the other firm does not, and both firms understand that
there is asymmetry in information. [10] In this section, we present two important models that
build on this feature of asymmetric information. The first is due to Bolton and Scharfstein
(1990) and focuses on the informational asymmetry between the new rival, such as Newvel,
and the bank from which it borrows. The second is due to Milgrom and Roberts (1982) and
focuses on the information asymmetry between the new rival, in our case Newvel, and the
dominant incumbent rival Microhard.

and Tirole (1986).

13.2.1 Predatory Pricing and Financial Constraints


Recall the two-period model above in which Microhard is the incumbent and Newvel is
the new firm that must borrow $115 million at the start of each period in order to operate.
Following Bolton and Schaferstein (1990) we make one important fundamental change. We
now assume that at the end of any period _only_ Newvel, and _not_ its bank or lender, knows
whether Newvel’s operating profit is $100 million or $200 million. To make clear how this
informational asymmetry affects both Newvel’s incentives in its dealing with the bank and
the bank’s incentive to lend to Newvel, we introduce the bank as an explicit player in the
game. Figure 13.1 illustrates the interaction between the Bank and Newvel for just a single
market period. The Bank first makes a loan. Then Nature chooses whether Newvel’s profit
is high or low. Subsequently, Newvel chooses whether to report high or low operating
profit. For each outcome, the net profit both to the Bank and to Newvel are shown. Because
the Bank moved first, its payoff is shown first.

Focusing on the game for just one period is insightful because, as Figure 13.1 makes clear,
the Bank would never lend Newvel the required $115 million if the game were only one
period long. The reason is straightforward. At the end of the period, only Newvel knows what
its profit is. Accordingly, it has every incentive to say that it was only $100 million, pay that
amount to the bank and default on any remaining amount. Obviously, if operating profit really
was $100 million, this is all Newvel can do. However, if actual profit were $200 million,
lying and reporting that profit was only $100 million allows Newvel to walk away with $100
million for itself. In other words, because only Newvel knows the truth, it has an incentive
to exploit this informational asymmetry to its own advantage. Anticipating this, however,
the Bank would realize that in a one-period setting it would never get more than $100
million in return for the $115 million that it lent. Therefore, it would never agree to the loan.

The one-period analysis carries two immediate insights for a two-period model. The first
is that whatever repayment _R_ the Bank gets at the end of the first period, it can never get
more than $100 million at the end of the second period. When the second period comes
about, it will simply be a replay of the one-period game just described. The other and related
insight is that if the Bank is actually to make a loan, it will have to write a contract that
extends over both periods. Two one-period contracts will just run into the same problem

twice. Somehow, the Bank and Newvel will have to agree on a contract that links the
repayment over both market periods.

Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) show that the optimal contract has the following terms.
First, recognizing that it will never get paid more than $100 million at the end of period two,
the Bank will contract for a high repayment at the end of period one. Second, to give Newvel
an incentive to report a high income at the end of the first period, the Bank will cut funding,
i.e., refuse to make a loan for the second period if Newvel reports low first-period income.
Because Newvel will only ever pay $100 million to the Bank at the end of the second period,
it can therefore expect to earn $150 − $100 = $50 million at that time, and this contractual
feature gives Newvel a real interest in making sure that the second period happens.

In our example the lending contract might look as follows. The Bank loans the required
$115 million at the start of the first period. At the end of that period, if Newvel reports the
higher profit of $200 million, then it is required to repay $150 million—its average profit.
When it does so, the Bank will lend the $115 million necessary to operate in the second
period. At the end of that second period, the Bank is paid $100 million despite what happens
by virtue of the earlier argument about a one-period loan. Alternatively, if at the end of the
first period Newvel reports only the lower profit of $100 million, the Bank is paid that amount
but _no_ further loans are made. Newvel in this case does not survive into the second period.

Figure 13.2 describes the nature of the loan contract. After the Bank makes an initial
loan, Nature’s choice of profit outcome occurs. This is not shown in the diagram because
at the end of the first period Newvel’s incentive is to report Nature’s draw accurately, and
the Bank understands this. If it is low, the loan is terminated and Newvel exits. If it is high,
the loan is extended for a second period, after which Nature again draws a profit outcome.
As we know, at the end of the second period Newvel has an incentive always to report a
low profit. The payoff pair shows the total payoff for the Bank and Newvel over the two
periods, with the Bank’s shown first.

Note that both parties do well with this contract. Consider the Bank. If first period profits
are low, Newvel is liquidated, and the Bank walks away with only $100 million for a loss
of $15 million. If, on the other hand, first period profits are high, the Bank is paid $150
million, thereby netting $35 million. However, it is then obligated to lend out $115 million
for a second time. At the end of the second period the Bank receives only $100 million
because at that point Newvel never reports a high income. Because good luck and bad
luck happen with equal probability, the Bank’s expected net profit from the two-period

**Bank**

contract is: 0.5[$100 − $115] + 0.5[ _(_ $150 − $115 _)_ + _(_ $100 − $115 _)_ ] = $2.5 million.
Note that this is exactly the profit the Bank earned with two, one-period contracts when it
was fully informed of Newvel’s income.

Newvel also earns a positive expected profit. At the end of the first period, it either
receives a net payment of [$200 − $150] or nothing, each with probability 0.5 so that the
expected payment at the end of the first period is $25 million. Similarly, at the end of the
second period, Newvel receives a net payment of either [$200 − $100] million or again
zero, each with probability 0.5, for an expected second-period income of $50 million.
Because the _ex ante_ probability of reaching the second period is just 0.5, the firm’s _ex ante_
expected profit for the second period is another $25 million so that the overall expected
profit over both periods is $50 million.

Yet while both players earn profit under the contract, there is a flaw. Half the time, Newvel
fails after the first period and no second period loan is made. This is inefficient because
that investment does have an expected profit of $35 million. Again, such inefficiency is the
result of the asymmetric information that characterizes the relationship between the Bank
and Newvel. The only way to prevent Newvel from exploiting its informational advantage
is to include a promise to stop funding Newvel should it perform badly in the first period.

Now let’s think about adding Microhard to the game. Suppose again that Microhard’s
duopoly profit is $150 million, its monopoly profit is $325 million, and by preying
and cutting prices below cost, its profit is reduced by $30 million. By cutting prices low
Microhard can raise the probability that Newvel will fail from 50 to 70 percent. Because now
Newvel exits whenever it fails to earn a first period profit of $200 million, predation results
in raising Microhard’s chance of being a monopolist in the second period by 20 percent.
Its expected profit then rises from 0.5 × $150 million + 0.5 × $325 million = $237.5 to
0.3 × $150 + 0.7 × $325 = $272.5 _,_ a gain of $35 million—more than enough to cover
the $30 million cost of predation. Unlike our earlier case, predation is now rational and
therefore should be expected to occur. [11]

The intuition as to why the outcome is different with asymmetric information from what
it was in our earlier analysis is straightforward. Newvel can report low first period profits
for one of two reasons. Either profits really are low because it has had bad luck including
being a possible victim of predation, or profits are really high but Newvel’s management
has hidden them by spending them on lavish offices, expensive business trips, and excessive
compensation. In the absence of a contract like the one described, the lender cannot easily
know the truth. If it simply believes whatever Newvel says, the lender will quickly find
that Newvel constantly reports low profits in every period and blames this on bad luck and
predation—leaving the lender holding the bag at a cost of _(_ $115 − $100 _)_ or $15 million
each time. The only way to prevent deception by Newvel’s management is to write a
two-period contract that, among other things, cuts off second period funding in the wake of
a poor first period profit. Yet while such a contract removes the potential for dishonesty, it
increases the likelihood that predation will be successful and therefore raises the incentive
for Microhard to engage in predatory tactics.

It is worth repeating that “pulling the plug” and killing Newvel at the start of the second
period is inefficient. Because Microhard will never predate in the second period, Newvel’s
expected profit in that period is $150 million. This is more than enough to pay off the
needed loan of $115 million. Nevertheless, the optimal contract is a two-period one that


11 The predation story told here is closely related to “long purse” or “deep pockets” models. See, e.g., Philips
(1995).


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 327


cannot look at the second period alone. As a result, this contract must call for Newvel’s
premature death if it does not report a good outcome in period one in order to keep Newvel
honest. [12]


because such behavior increases the odds of Newvel failing in the market from 50 percent
to 70 percent, an increase of 20 percent. What is the lowest increase in unfavorable odds
that will induce Microhard to engage in predatory behavior?


13.2.2 Asymmetric Information and Limit Pricing


In the Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) model, the upstart rival firm Newvel knows a lot about
the market. Newvel knows not only its own profitability, but it understands the profits and
incentives facing Microhard as well. In reality, this is often unlikely to be the case. A new
firm can typically only guess at the profits and costs of the rival incumbent. In their classic
paper, Milgrom and Roberts (1982) present a model in which the assumption that the rival
entrant firm is perfectly informed is relaxed. Specifically, they assume that the rival entrant
firm does not know the incumbent firm’s cost of production. In this context charging a low
price to keep the entrant out may no longer be an empty bluff. We now turn to the classic
Milgrom and Roberts (1982) limit pricing model, noting that in this model we return to
strategies aimed at preventing the entry of a rival and not ones aimed at eliminating an
existing rival.

The setting is again a two period game in which there is a long-standing incumbent and
a _potential_ entrant. At the risk of repetition, let’s again call the incumbent Microhard and
the potential entrant Newvel. There is no lender or other player. Microhard is alone in
the market in the first period. During that time, Newvel observes Microhard’s behavior,
specifically the price that Microhard chooses to set for that period, and then Newvel decides
whether or not to enter the market in the second period. As before, we assume the interest
rate is zero so that we do not have to worry about discounting future profits.

Newvel knows its own unit cost and the market demand in each period, but Newvel
does not know Microhard’s unit cost. Microhard, on the other hand, knows its unit cost,
Newvel’s unit cost, as well as market demand in each period. Each firm also knows that
the other also understands all of this. From Newvel’s perspective, Microhard’s unit cost
could be either high or low, depending on factors such as the expertise of management, the
quality of equipment, or the input prices that Microhard has negotiated with its suppliers.
These are all features of production costs that are in fact not easily ascertained by outsiders.
And while Newvel does not know Microhard’s unit cost, it does know something about
how likely it is that Microhard is a high-cost or low-cost type. Specifically, Newvel knows
that there is a probability _ρ_ that Microhard has a low cost and a probability _(_ 1 − _ρ)_ that it
has a high cost.

In the interest of making the model easier to understand, we will again work through a
specific numeric example. Let’s assume that when Microhard has low costs and acts like a
profit-maximizing monopoly in the first period, it sets a relatively low price but, because


12 Strictly speaking, the contract described is only optimal if it is unobserved by Microhard. If Microhard
can observe the details of the loan, the contract may be written in a way that deters predation.




328 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


of its low costs, earns a profit equal to $100 million. In contrast, if it were a less efficient
high-cost monopoly, Microhard’s profit-maximizing price would be higher, but again due
to its cost inefficiency, it would earn less profit at that price, namely, $60 million. Finally,
we assume that if Microhard were a high-cost firm but, nevertheless, chose the price that is
optimal for a low-cost incumbent, its profit would fall still further to $40 million.

Microhard’s second period profits depend both on its unit cost and on whether or not
Newvel comes into the market. We will assume that if Microhard is alone in the second
period, it simply sets the monopoly price appropriate for its cost structure because entry
is no longer a worry. It then earns either $100 million (low-cost monopoly profit) or $60
million (high-cost monopoly profit) in the second period when no entry occurs. We also
assume that the potential entrant Newvel earns a profit of 0 whenever it stays out of the
market.

If entry occurs in the second period, Microhard’s profit suffers. If it is a low-cost firm,
it earns only $50 million in the second period when Newvel is present. If Microhard is
a high-cost firm, it is able to compete less and earns only $20 million. If Newvel enters
and competes against an inefficient, high-cost incumbent, it earns a positive profit of $20
million. But if the incumbent turns out to be a low-cost type, then entry results in a _loss_ of
$20 million for Newvel.

The extensive form for this example of the entry game is shown in Figure 13.3. Newvel’s
uncertainty about Microhard’s cost is modeled by introducing the player Nature who moves
first and chooses the cost of the incumbent firm. With probability _ρ_ Nature chooses a
low-cost incumbent and with probability _(_ 1 − _ρ)_ Nature chooses a high-cost incumbent.
Microhard moves next and sets either a high or low price when it sells output in the first
period. Then Newvel decides whether to enter and to compete in period two or to stay
out. At the end of each path, we show the total payoffs for each firm over the two periods
depending on the choices about prices and entering. Microhard’s total profit is the sum of
its profit in each period. Newvel’s profit is just that which it earns in the market for the final
period.

Figure 13.3 shows three possibilities for Microhard. The first is that it is a high-cost
firm and sets a first-period monopoly price that corresponds to being high cost. The second
possibility is that it is again a high-cost firm but now chooses to set the lower price



Microhard profit = $60 + $20 = $80

appropriate for a more cost-efficient firm. Finally, the third possibility is that Microhard is
truly a low-cost firm and sets the lower monopoly price corresponding to being low cost.
Note that we have ruled out the possibility of a low-cost Microhard charging the high-cost
monopoly price. We will see in a moment that a low-cost Microhard has no incentive
to do so. One important point to understand is that we have captured the asymmetry of
information, or who knows what, by circling together the nodes E2 and E3. This is meant
to indicate that when the entrant Newvel observes a low price in the first period, it does not
know whether that corresponds to node E2 or E3 _,_ and Microhard, the incumbent, knows
that the entrant firm does not know at which node it is.

You may ask at this point why a high-cost incumbent firm would ever set a sub-optimally
low price that would lead to a lower level of profit. The answer is that this may influence
the entrant’s decision to enter in the second period. Newvel might, for instance, reason as
follows: “If Microhard charges a high price during the first period, it must be an inefficient,
high-cost firm and I will enter. However, if Microhard charges a low price, it must be a
cost-efficient firm, and I best stay out of the market.” In this setting, there is a considerable
incentive for a high-cost incumbent initially to play against type and set the low monopoly
price in the first period. True, this will mean that it earns only a profit of $40 million
instead of the $60 million during the first period. Yet given the entrant firm’s reasoning, this
sacrifice pays off in the second period because it deters entry and thereby permits Microhard
then to earn a profit of $60 million rather than the $20 million it would have earned had it
initially set a high price that would have encouraged entry.

This same reasoning helps explain our assertion above that a low-cost incumbent firm
will never initially set the high-cost monopoly price. Such a choice is not profit-maximizing
in the short run and, in addition, serves to attract entry.

Our analysis so far makes clear that what happens in this game is sensitive to the nature
of the beliefs that Newvel holds based on the behavior of Microhard observed in the first
period. What we have just said above is that if Newvel believes “low price means low-cost,
high price means high-cost,” its entry decision will be easily manipulated by Microhard.
Accordingly, this may not be a very reasonable sort of belief for Newvel to hold. We should
therefore expect that Newvel will also realize this and will adopt an alternative way to
interpret the evidence observed in the first period.

The important question here is what beliefs are reasonable. Suppose that Newvel—
recognizing the foregoing argument—thinks in a different way. Because Newvel understands that it is possible for both a high-cost and a low-cost type firm to play a low-price
strategy, it reasons that observing a low first period price really gives no useful information
as to the type of incumbent it is facing. Instead, when Newvel observes a low initial price
it simply uses what it knows about the probabilities associated with different cost types.
Specifically, when Newvel observes a low price, it simply concludes that Microhard is a
low-cost firm with probability _ρ_ and a high-cost one with probability _(_ 1 − _ρ)_ . However,
because a low-cost firm never has an incentive to charge a high price, Newvel does continue
to believe that a high price in the first period means that Microhard has high costs. In other
words, Newvel’s conditional inferences are as follows:


_If Microhard sets a low price in period 1, it has a low unit cost with probability ρ and a_

_high unit cost with probability (_ 1 − _ρ)_ . _Accordingly, second period entry will yield an_
_expected profit of_ [ _(_ 1 − _ρ)_ $20 − _ρ_ $20] _million_ .
_If Microhard sets a high price in period 1, it has a high unit cost. Second-period entry will_

_yield a certain profit of_ $20 _million_ .


330 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


The foregoing beliefs are rational. Note, however, that they imply that if Newvel
observes a low first-period price and then enters, its _expected profit_ when it enters is:
−$20 _ρ_ + $20 _(_ 1 − _ρ)_ = 20 − 40 _ρ_ (in millions). If Nature’s draw or the probability that
Microhard is a low-cost firm is high enough, in our example, if _ρ >_ 1 _/_ 2 _,_ then Newvel’s
_expected profit_ from entering is negative. Consequently, it will not enter if it observes a low
price. Microhard can work this out, too. It will therefore recognize that if the probability
of being a low-cost firm _ρ >_ 1 _/_ 2 _,_ it will do better by pretending to be a low-cost firm and
setting a low price in the first period even if, in reality, it is a high-cost firm. Once again,
this will lead to a profit of $40 million initially and then, in the second period when the
firm is a secure monopoly, a profit of $60 million, for a total profit of $100 million. This
is better than the alternative strategy of initially charging a high price that would reveal its
type to the potential entrant, invite entry, and lead to the lower total profit of $80 million.
That is, when _ρ >_ 1 _/_ 2 _,_ a high-cost Microhard will set a limit price—one lower than its true
profit-maximizing price—in order to deter an imperfectly informed entrant from entering
the market. This again is what we mean by predatory conduct. [13]

In sum, both the Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) and the Milgrom and Roberts (1982)
models show how pricing below cost or predatory pricing can be rational or, more formally,
part of a subgame perfect strategy in a dynamic game. When the players, either investors or
rivals, have incomplete information, the incumbents may find that they can manipulate or
exploit that information asymmetry in a way that eliminates rival firms.

Now recall McGee’s (1958) claim that predatory pricing is dominated by the alternative
strategy of eliminating rivals by buying them out. As we noted earlier, there are weaknesses
in this argument, perhaps most notably the fact that buying out any rival is likely to
encourage more and more rivals to enter just for the privilege of being bought out. Yet
ignoring those issues for the moment, it does seem reasonable to ask if the profitability of
predatory tactics in the informationally asymmetric settings just described is indeed less
than the profitability of merging in these environments.

The simple answer is that it is difficult to say without more information. There are
numerous private lawsuits filed by alleged victims of predatory tactics and few of these
plaintiffs appear to have had the option of merging. This suggests that the issues raised
earlier about the feasibility of McGee’s “buy out your rival” strategy are real. Yet there
is also a more complex answer, which is that the two tactics are not mutually exclusive.
Indeed, predatory pricing and corporate acquisition may both be part of the same overall


13 We can complicate the story by introducing uncertainty on both sides of the game. Suppose, for instance,
that Newvel does not know what Microhard’s payoff is from fighting an entrant, and Microhard does not
know a potential entrant’s pay-off from entering. Specifically, from an entrant’s point of view, Microhard
can be one of two types: with probability _p_ [0] Microhard is believed to be “tough” (i.e., low-cost), which
means that its pay-offs are such that it will always fight in every market; and with probability 1 − _p_ [0]

Microhard is believed to be “weak” (i.e., high-cost) and more accommodating of entry. Similarly, each
potential entrant is believed by Microhard to be “tough” with probability _q_ [0] _,_ in which case the entrant
will always enter no matter what Microhard does; and to be “weak” with probability 1 − _q_ [0] _,_ in which
case the entrant’s pay-offs are as in the current example. The “tough” version of Microhard always fights
and so is of no interest to us. What _is_ of interest is that a Microhard that knows itself to be “weak” will,
as before, still have an incentive to fight entry in order to develop a reputation in the minds of potential
entrants that it might, in fact, be “tough.” The willingness of a “weak” incumbent to fight is an increasing
function of _p_ [0] and a decreasing function of _q_ [0] . More generally, the greater the number of markets there
are the lower is the probability _p_ [0] necessary for entry to be deterred. Simply put, a “weak” incumbent is
more likely to fight entry if there are “many” of its markets remaining in which entry has not taken place
than if there are “fewer.”


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 331


strategy. This is the idea in the take-over game analyzed by Saloner (1987) that is somewhat
similar to the Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) model. In that game, the incumbent may cut
prices low to reduce the profitability of the entrant precisely because by making the entrant
less profitable, the incumbent can buy this rival at a lower cost.

Burns (1986) offers evidence that American Tobacco used the predatory pricing tactic
exactly in this manner to acquire many of the forty-three rival firms that it ultimately bought.
Specifically, Burns (1986) finds that after identifying the target rival it wished to eliminate,
American Tobacco would then introduce a competing brand at a low price in the target’s
market. The resultant drop in the target firm’s profit would induce it to settle for a lower
acquisition price—25 percent lower by Burns’ (1986) estimates. [14] Brevoort and Marvel
(2004) report similar tactics by the National Cash Register (NCR) company, except that
in this case, price reductions on specialized product lines were accompanied by harassing
lawsuits charging the rival with violating NCR’s patent rights. Brevoort and Marvel (2004)
find one case that particularly stands out, namely, NCR’s purchase of a rival named The Ideal
Register Co. After repeated price cuts and legal challenges, Ideal eventually consented to
being acquired by NCR for about $12,000 despite the fact that internal company documents
suggested that NCR was willing to pay as much as $125,000 for Ideal.


13.3 CONTRACTS AS A BARRIER TO ENTRY


Our discussion of preemption in the previous chapter suggested that early building of plant
capacity might be useful in persuading buyers to contract for purchases later. This suggests
that part of the preemption story is related to the nature of contracts. Experience confirms
this intuition. For example, while much of the Microsoft antitrust trial has focused on
Microsoft’s practice of bundling its _Internet Explorer_ web browser in with its _Windows_
operating system, that was not the only issue of concern. Another crucial question in the
case was whether or not Microsoft was able, through its contracts with PC makers, to
foreclose other rivals from entering the operating systems market in which Microsoft had a
virtual monopoly.

Indeed, concerns that contractual requirements may be used to exclude rivals have been
an important issue in antitrust litigation for well over 100 years. The troubling contract
provisions and the attendant antitrust concerns over this time span are perhaps best illustrated
by the cases involving the United Shoe Machinery (USM) company. The first of these was
decided in 1918, the next in 1922, and the most well known in 1953.

USM was created in 1899 as a result of the merger of seven separate shoe machine
firms. In general, these firms produced machines related either to different types of shoes
or to different parts of the shoe-making business, i.e., they were mostly complementary
machines. Nevertheless, the new USM started with control of 60 to 70 percent of all North
American shoe machine manufacturing. From the very beginning, USM followed a policy
of not selling but only leasing its machines to shoe-making companies. It was the terms of
these lease contracts that repeatedly landed the company in the courts.


14 In 1911, immediately following the Standard Oil decision, the Supreme Court found American Tobacco
guilty of monopolizing the cigarette and tobacco product market, and cited predation to induce rivals to
sell out as evidence of illegal monopolistic intent. A district court ordered that American Tobacco be
dissolved and reconstituted as separate firms, the big three being American Tobacco, Ligget and Myers,
and Lorillard.


332 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


To begin with, USM leases were long, lasing seventeen years. If the shoe company using
the machine needed to add capacity, it had to lease another USM machine. Typically the
shoe-maker needed different types of machines, and the contracts required that if the firm
leased one type of USM machine, it had to use other USM machines for other kinds of
work. Conversely, if a shoe manufacturer violated the terms of its contract for one type of
machine, USM had the right to terminate the firm’s leases for all of its USM machines. It
may seem clear that some or all of these provisions were aimed at foreclosing the market
to rival shoe-machine makers. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court initially sided with USM
and permitted the lease only policy and the terms of the leases to remain. In reaching this
judgment, the Court relied largely on a simple point. If these restrictions were harmful
to shoemakers, why did they sign the contracts? This is an important question. If a shoe
manufacturer understands that there is an alternative machine producer that will come on
line soon, why should it sign a contract with USM that will prevent it from later contracting
with this alternative supplier?

Prominent Chicago School scholars such as Bork (1978) and Posner (1976) have used the
voluntary nature of restrictive contracts as a major reason to be skeptical that such contracts
are a predatory device. In their view, any contract signed must give not just the supplier
but also the buyer some benefit—say by way of increased service or repair. In turn, this
implies that the deal ratified by the contract must be a step toward greater efficiency. These
proponents of the Chicago School emphasize the efficiency grounds for observed contracts
rather than the predatory motive. As we shall see, however, more recent theory has provided
consistent arguments supporting the view that predation can occur in this rational world.
We present two basic analyses showing that buyers may voluntarily sign contracts with
suppliers that, in fact, are predatory and inefficient. The first is due to Aghion and Bolton
(1987). The second is due to Rasmussen, Rasmeyer, and Wiley (1991). We briefly present
a numerical example illustrating each model in turn.


13.3.1 Long-Term Exclusive Contracts as Predatory Instruments


Aghion and Bolton (1987) consider a market for some essential intermediate good that
extends over two periods. In the first period, there is an incumbent monopoly seller of the
good whose unit cost we will assume is $50. Each buyer of this good uses exactly one unit
of the input per period and is willing to pay up to $100 for the product. In the second period
there is the possible arrival of a new entrant. This is recognized by all parties at the start
of the first period. However, neither a buyer in the second period nor the monopoly seller
initially in the market knows the unit cost _c_ of this second period potential entrant. All that
these initial participants know is that _c_ is distributed randomly but uniformly on the interval
between $0 and $100 _._

We begin by considering matters from the viewpoint of a buyer looking forward to the
second period. We assume that if the entrant actually enters the market at that time, Bertrand
or price competition will emerge between the initial monopoly supplier and the new rival. If
the entrant’s unit cost _c_ exceeds $50 _,_ however, it will lose this competition. With _c >_ $50 _,_
the incumbent can always underbid the entrant. The entrant obviously knows this. Hence,
if the entrant finds that its cost _c >_ $50 _,_ no entry will occur. In this case, which by our
assumption happens with probability 1/2, the incumbent remains a monopolist and can
charge a buyer its full reservation price of $100 for the good.

However, if _c_ ≤ $50 _,_ then entry will occur. In this case, the competition between the
entrant and the incumbent will bid the price down to $50, at which point the incumbent will


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 333


drop out. Once this happens, however, the entrant is under no additional pressure to lower
its price so a buyer will end up paying $50 for the good for any case in which _c_ ≤ $50. This
too happens with probability 1/2. Notice that once again there is an element of uncertainty
as well as some asymmetry. For 0 ≤ _c_ ≤ 50 _,_ only the entrant will know its true cost as the
buyer will be charged $50 no matter the cost.

One of the two scenarios just outlined must happen. Therefore, in the absence of any
contract obligating a buyer to purchase from the initial incumbent, the buyer’s expected
price for the intermediate good in the second period is:


1 _/_ 2 × $50 + 1 _/_ 2 × $100 = $75 (13.1)


Note that equation (13.1) also implies that because a buyer values the product at $100 _,_
the buyer should expect a surplus of $25 in the absence of any contract with the initial
monopolist supplier. To put it another way, any contract that the incumbent offers the
buyer must promise the buyer an expected surplus of at least $25 in the second period, or
the buyer will not sign it. The question then is whether the monopolist can and will offer
such a contract. If it will, we would also like to know the efficiency aspects of such an
arrangement.

One long-term contract that a buyer might find attractive is the following. In the first
period, the buyer agrees to make its second-period purchase of the good from the incumbent
at a price of $75 with only one possible exception. The exception is that the buyer can
instead make its second-period purchase from the new entrant so long as it pays the initial
incumbent a $50 breach-of-contract fee.

There are several features of this proposed contract that deserve emphasis. First, observe
that the entrant will now only enter the market if its cost _c_ ≤ $25. The reason is that in the
second period, a buyer can either buy from the incumbent for $75 or from the entrant at
some price _p_ plus the breach-of-contract fee of $50. Hence, a buyer will prefer to fulfill
the contract rather than switch to the alternative supplier unless that supplier charges a
price of $25 or less. However, the only way that the entrant can do this is when cost
_c_ ≤ $25. Accordingly, the entrant will only enter the market when _c_ ≤ $25. Notice that
this also implies that the contract restricts entry. Without the contract, entry occurred with
probability 1/2. With the contract, entry will only occur when _c_ ≤ $25 _,_ which happens only
with probability 1/4.

Will the buyer actually sign the proposed contract? This is where the second noteworthy
feature of the agreement becomes relevant. The contract is such that no matter what happens,
the buyer will pay $75 for the good. Three-fourths of the time, the potential rival will not
enter and the buyer will pay the stipulated $75 to the initial incumbent. One-fourth of the
time, the rival will have a cost _c_ ≤ $25. In this case, it will enter and charge the buyer the
highest price it can while still making a sale, namely, $25 (or just a penny less). A buyer
will then switch and purchase the good from the new entrant at $25 but, in addition, pay
a $50 breach-of-contract fee to the initial incumbent. Again, the buyer’s total payment is
$75 _,_ leaving it a surplus of $25. Thus, a buyer’s expected (in fact guaranteed) surplus with
this contract is $25. Because this is also its expected profit or surplus without the contract,
a buyer will be willing to sign the agreement.

The next question is whether or not the incumbent monopoly seller will actually find it
worthwhile to offer the agreement. Here again the answer is yes. To see this, we now need
to consider the monopoly seller’s expected profit both without and with the contract.

In the absence of any agreement, the incumbent monopolist will sell to a buyer at a price
of $100 half the time. The other half of the time it will be underbid by the new entrant.
When it does sell at $100 _,_ the incumbent makes a profit of $50. Because this happens
with probability 1/2, the monopoly seller’s expected profit in the second period without the
contract is 1 _/_ 2 × $50 = $25 per customer.


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 335


With the contract, the calculation of the incumbent’s profit is slightly more complicated.
With probability 3/4, the monopolist will still sell to the buyer at the pre-specified price of
$75. Because the monopolist has a unit cost of $50 _,_ such a sale generates a profit of $25.
With probability 1/4, however, the monopolist makes no sale because the buyer breaks the
contract and switches to the new entrant. This is not bad news, however. The switch means
that the monopolist no longer has to incur the $25 unit production cost. Moreover, the
buyer’s breach of contract entitles the seller to a $50 fee in the one-fourth of the time that
the contract is broken. In short, the contract offers the initial incumbent seller an expected
surplus in period two of:


3 _/_ 4 × _(_ $75 − $50 _)_ + 1 _/_ 4 × $50 = $31.25 _>_ $25 (13.2)


As equation (13.2) makes clear, the monopoly seller’s expected profit with the contract
is $31.25 _,_ an amount that definitely exceeds its expected profit of $25 without the contract.
Moreover, we have already shown that a typical buyer’s expected surplus is the same
whether the agreement is in force or not. In other words, the incumbent monopolist is made
better off and the buyer is made no worse off by the contract. Accordingly, with one party
desiring the contract and the other indifferent, we expect that the contract will be offered
and signed.

From a social viewpoint, however, the contract is inefficient. To be sure, it does
increase the expected surplus of the buyer and seller together from $50 _(_ = $25 + $25 _)_ to
$56.25 _(_ = $25 + $31.25 _)_ for a net gain of $6.25. However, it reduces the entrant’s expected
surplus by more than this amount. Why?

Without the contract, the entrant will stay out of the market half the time and enter the
other half. When it does enter, the entrant will sell at a price of $50 per unit. In such cases,
the entrant’s unit cost _c_ will range from 0 to $50 or $25 _,_ on average. This implies that the
entrant has an expected profit of 1 _/_ 2 × _(_ $50 − $25 _)_ = $12.50 when there is no contract.
When the incumbent binds a second period buyer with a contract, the potential rival only
enters the market with probability 1/4 and sells at a price of only $25. Its unit cost in such
cases will range from 0 to $25 _,_ or $12.50 on average. So, once the contract is signed, the
potential rival’s expected profit is only 1 _/_ 4 × _(_ $25 − $12.50 _)_ = $3.13. From this, we can
see that the issuance of a contract reduces the potential entrant’s expected surplus from
$12.50 to $3.13 _,_ or by $9.37. As noted, this reduction exceeds the joint gains to the buyer
and seller _(_ $6.25 _),_ so the total social surplus is less with the contract than without it.

The intuition behind the foregoing result, however, is subtle. From the buyer’s perspective,
the problem is that without the contract, the new entrant will never sell at a price less than
$50—even if it has a cost of $0. Ideally, the buyer would like to benefit more in such
cases where the entrant has such a particularly low cost. Yet, in the absence of the contract,
nothing compels the new entrant to engage in such sharing. Once the price falls to $50 _,_ the
initial incumbent drops out of the market, and the entrant faces no further pressure to reduce
its price. By offering the contract, the incumbent monopolist effectively enables the buyer
to force the seller never to charge a price above $25. The buyer is, as just noted, willing to
pay for this service.

The point is that even though a contract may bring benefits to a monopoly supplier and
its buyers, the contract is still inefficient if it achieves these gains only by reducing the
surplus of the new entrant by an even greater amount. The inefficiency reflects the fact
that under the contract regime, some desirable entry is prevented. Specifically, entry does
not occur when the new rival has a cost _c_ satisfying $25 _< c_ ≤ $50 despite the fact that


336 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


within this range, the entrant is more efficient than the initial monopoly seller. Because of
the breach-of-contract clause in the long-term contract, the entrant cannot break into the
market.


13.3.2 Naked Exclusion


The Rasmusen, Ramseyer, and Wiley (1991) model differs from the above in so far as it
focuses on an externality in the contract rather than on an uncertainty. Suppose again that
there is one supplier with a unit cost of $50 _,_ and, say, three buyers. As before, each buyer
will pay up to $100 for one unit of the input. There is also an entrant with a unit cost of $40
waiting to enter the market next period. However, the entrant also has a sunk cost—say due
to market research or promotional activities—of $60. Hence, to underbid the incumbent
and cover its sunk cost, the entrant has to serve at least two customers. If the new entrant
serves three customers, it can charge each a price as low as $60. The $20 total that it earns
in operating profit from each customer will, in total, cover the firm’s overhead. If it serves
two customers, the entrant can still underbid the incumbent, but it must now charge a price
no lower than $70. If it serves only one customer, the entrant must charge a price of $100
to acquire the $60 needed to cover its sunk cost. In this case, the entrant will not find entry
attractive.

The incumbent can of course match any of the entrant’s price offers in the second period.
Still, the incumbent has to recognize that if the entrant comes in at a price of $70 and the
incumbent has to match that price, the incumbent’s profit will fall to $60 even if it keeps
all three customers. The incumbent, therefore, has some incentive to stop the entrant from
acquiring two or more clients with a long-term contract. To sell this contract, the incumbent
engages in the following tactic. It tells two customers that each of them will be able to buy
the input at $70 if, and only if, each signs an exclusive contract promising not to buy from
any other supplier. Why might this work?

Each buyer offered an exclusive contract with a purchase price of $70 now has to worry.
Once two sign the contract, no offer needs to be made to the third because once two buyers
are bound to the incumbent, the entrant cannot profitably underbid the incumbent’s price.
Therefore, the third buyer may well face a price of $100 once the other two have signed.
In an effort to avoid such an outcome, each buyer will rush to sign the contract. In fact, by
playing buyers against each other in this way, the incumbent may be able to sign exclusive
deals even if it offers a small price reduction to only $90 _._

Here again the contract inefficiently blocks entry. The potential entrant is a more efficient
producer. The problem is that each buyer looks only to the effect that the contract has on that
buyer’s profit. Each ignores the impact that signing the contract has on overall competition
and the profitability of other buyers (perhaps some of whom are rivals to the buyer in the
downstream market).


13.3.3 Tying Contracts


We discussed bundling as an entry-deterring strategy in both Chapters 4 and 12. As tying is
more or less a generalization of bundling, it should not be surprising that similar arguments
apply to tying contracts as well. Of course, the Chicago School’s “only one profit” approach
eloquently presented by Posner (1976) and Bork (1978) among others, rejects the use of
bundling or tying as part of a predatory strategy. In that view, centered on complementary
products such as cameras and film, or food and lodging, what consumers really value is the


Predatory Conduct: More Recent Developments 337


combined good—e.g., a room and a meal. In that case, any rise in the price of, say, a meal
will only lower the price that can be charged for a room. In this view, a monopoly hotel
owner on a small resort island, for example, has little incentive to try to monopolize the
local restaurant market. [15]

There are, however, at least three responses to the Chicago School analysis. First, while
visiting tourists may be interested in both food and lodging, there are likely local residents
who are interested only in restaurant meals. If this segment of the meals market is large,
then we really have two independent goods and correspondingly, two independent markets.
In this case, there is not “one monopoly profit” but effectively two—one for each market.
As a result, tying can be profitable if it helps the hotel owner establish a monopoly in this
second, largely unrelated market—say by denying an upstart restaurant enough consumers
from those who value both goods such that the entrant cannot cover its average cost.

A second reason that the hotel owner (or the camera maker, etc.) may want to use tying
or bundling to exclude rivals in a second market is that failure to do so may eventually lead
to the loss of monopoly in the basic commodity. Thus, if the hotel owner does not eliminate
rival restaurants on the island, one of these may eventually build a motel.

Finally, as we saw in Chapter 8, both tying and bundling are also techniques of price
discrimination. While such price discrimination may eliminate a competitive film market
(recall Microsoft and Netscape), it must nevertheless be acknowledged that if the price
discrimination motivation is paramount, the incumbent firm will pursue it independent of
the presence of any rival. Hence, this is not predation. Moreover, to the extent that this price
discrimination expands the market, it tends to raise welfare.

In short, there are good practical and theoretical reasons to believe that bundling/tying
are often part of an entry-deterring or exit-encouraging strategy. Yet there are equally good
reasons to see these tactics as part of sophisticated price discrimination techniques. While
the early Chicago “only one profit” analysis likely fails to hold, the welfare implications of
bundling and tying remain complicated. They can be resolved only on a case-by-case basis
built on careful analysis of each market setting.


13.4 PREDATION AND REPUTATION


There is one other point that we wish to make about the profitability of predation. This is
that firms rarely operate in just one market or for just one period. Whatever competition
it faces in one market today, a firm can usually count on potential rivals emerging in its
other markets or even the same market in the future. In such cases, the gains from predatory
activity may include the establishment of a reputation that also deters these potential rivals
in other markets and times.

For example, consider again our limit pricing game between Microhard and Newvel but
with one change. This is that when Microhard is a high-cost firm and sets the low-cost
optimal price as a monopolist, its profits really suffer. In particular, its profits fall from $60
million to just $19 million, i.e., the cost of misrepresentation is now $41 million.

If this were the only change, the incumbent would no longer find it worthwhile to try
to fool the entrant that it is a low-cost firm. The cost now is too high. As a high-cost firm
with a second period monopoly, it earns $60 million, while as a high cost duopolist it earns
$20 million. Thus, by persuading the entrant to stay out, the firm preserves $40 million of
profit. Yet, as just noted, our new assumption implies that to deter entry by initially pricing


338 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


as a low-cost firm even though it is a high-cost one, the incumbent now incurs a cost of $41
million. So, the gain would not appear worth the cost.

However, the foregoing analysis neglects the fact that later rival entrants or entrants in
other markets in which the incumbent operates are also watching. They too will use the
incumbent’s behavior at this time in this market to infer its type and therefore its behavior
in later periods and/or other markets. Thus, by acting as a low-cost firm the incumbent gains
a reputation for aggressive pricing that may be enough to deter these other rivals. If this is
the case, the gains from “acting tough” in the current market and period in question include
the profit increases the incumbent enjoys from keeping its position in these other periods
and markets.

Needless to say, the advantage gained by establishing a reputation as a tough competitor
is independent of whether that reputation is earned as a result of low pricing, insisting on
long-term contracts, tying purchases, or other means. All of the predatory tactics we have
discussed have enhanced value to the extent that they deter rivals in markets beyond the
ones in which they are applied.

The favorable effect of a reputation for toughness are clearly evident in the history
of the National Cash Register (NCR) company in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
documented by Brevoort and Marvel (2004). The cash register was a major advance at this
time. Not only was it able to store money like the common till, but it was also able both to
display the precise charge to customers in large visible digits and, most importantly, keep a
running record of all the day’s transactions—keeping clerks honest and providing valuable
information to managers.

John Henry Patterson quickly saw the cash register’s value. He bought the patent rights
from the machine’s creator, James Ritty, and established NCR in 1884, complete with
an expanded sales force to promote the product. Sales and profits grew rapidly and, of
course, soon attracted rival cash register firms. Patterson’s response was to create a special
division called the Competition Department. The purpose of this division was simple:
use promotions and other tactics—including threats of patent infringement lawsuits and
sabotage of rival machines—to suppress these rivals. A particularly widely used strategy
was to have an NCR agent visit a customer using a rival machine and surreptitiously insert
a piece of metal or other object to make the machine malfunction. As the owner examined
and attempted to repair the machine, the NCR representative would appear and offer to
replace the machine with an NCR model typically referred to as a “knocker.” NCR knockers
were typically low-end NCR models often modified to look like those of other firms to
match customers’ specific tastes. NCR sold the knockers at well below cost, especially
when considering the salary and expenses of paying the NCR representatives selling them.
In this way, NCR was able to cut prices selectively against rivals in any region that they
appeared, rather than cut prices across the board. [15]

The results of NCR’s aggressive campaigns against rivals were clear. By 1900, the
company had 90 percent or more of the cash register market. Newsletters at the time
suggested that over 95 percent of the cash register companies formed in the prior decade
had gone out of business. Equally important for our purposes is the fact that there were
virtually no new entrants into the business for the next twenty years, and the entry that
began to occur after 1920 was due to NCR’s signing a consent decree in court to limit
its aggressive behavior. In short, NCR appears to have consciously engaged in predatory
tactics and established a reputation for doing so with the goal of suppressing competition.
