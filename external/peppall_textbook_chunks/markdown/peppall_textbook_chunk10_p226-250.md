One of the most successful companies in the history of business is Coca-Cola. Indeed,
“Coca-Cola” is said to be the second most well-known phrase in the world, the first being
“okay.” [1] Yet despite its iconic status in American popular culture, Coca-Cola is not a
monopoly. Coca-Cola shares the carbonated soft drink market share with its archrival
PepsiCo. An ongoing battle for market share has engaged these two companies for almost
100 years. The cola wars have been fought with a number of strategies, one of which is
the frequent introduction of new soft drink products. Pepsi launched _Pepsi Vanilla_ in the
summer of 2003 in response to the year-earlier introduction of _Vanilla Coke_ . In 2006,
Coke initiated its biggest new brand campaign in twenty-two years for its new diet drink,
_Coke Zero_ . This followed Pepsi’s revitalization of its _Pepsi One_ brand made with Splenda
sweetener instead of Aspartame.

In fighting these cola wars, each company must identify and implement the strategy that
it believes is best suited to gaining a competitive advantage in the soft drink industry. If
Coca-Cola were a monopoly, it would not have to worry about any rivals. Nebbither does
a perfectly competitive firm. The pure monopolist has no rivals and the company in a
perfectly competitive market has no effect on its rivals. Each such firm is so small that its
decisions have no effect at all on the industry.

However, Coke, Pepsi, and many if not the majority of other real world firms live in
the middle ground of _oligopoly_, in which firms have visible rivals with whom strategic
interaction is a fact of life. Each firm is aware that its actions affect others, and therefore,
prompt _re_ actions. Each firm must, therefore, take these interactions into account when
making a decision about prices, output, or other business actions. _Game theory_ is the
analytic framework used to formally analyze strategic interaction. As a result, game theory
and the study of oligopoly are closely intertwined. In this chapter we introduce some basic
game theoretic analysis to show how it may be used to understand oligopoly markets.

Game theory itself is divided into two branches: _noncooperative_ and _cooperative_ game
theory. [2] The essential difference between these two branches is that in noncooperative

sentence (Tedlow 1996).

Rasmusen (2007).

games, the unit of analysis is the individual decision-maker or player, for example, the firm.
By contrast, cooperative game theory takes the unit of analysis to be a group or a coalition of
players, for example, a group of firms. We will focus almost exclusively on noncooperative
game theory. The individual player will be the firm. The _rules of the game_ will define how
competition between the different players or firms takes place. The noncooperative setting
means that each player is concerned only with doing as well as possible for himself or herself,
and not in advancing a more general group interest. As we shall see though, such noncooperative behavior can sometimes look very much like cooperative behavior because cooperation
sometimes turns out to maximize the well-being of each individual player, as well.

Two basic assumptions underlie the application of noncooperative game theory to
oligopoly. The first is that _firms are rational_ . They pursue well-defined goals, principally
profit maximization. The second basic assumption is that firms apply their rationality to
the process of _reasoning strategically_ . That is, in making its decisions, each firm uses all
the knowledge it has to form expectations regarding how other firms will behave. The
motivation behind these assumptions is that our ultimate goal is to understand and predict
how real firms will act. We assume that firms are rational and reason strategically because
we suspect that real firms do precisely this or will be forced to do so by market pressures.
Hence, understanding what rational and strategic behavior implies ought to be useful for
understanding and predicting real world outcomes.

There is one caution that any introduction to the study of oligopoly must include. It is that,
unlike the textbook competition and monopoly cases, there is no single, standard oligopoly
model. Differences in the rules of the game such as the number of players, the information
available to the various players, and the timing of each player’s actions all conspire to
yield a number of possible scenarios. Yet while there is not a single theory or model of
oligopoly, common themes and insights from the various models of oligopoly do emerge.
Understanding these broad concepts is our goal for the next three chapters. Moreover, we
should add that the lack of one single oligopoly model is not entirely a disadvantage. Rather,
it means that one has a rich assortment of models from which to choose for any particular
investigation. One model will be appropriate for some settings, a different model for other
settings. Because the real business world environment is quite diverse, it is useful to have a
variety of analyses from which to draw. We will present three different oligopoly models.
In this chapter we introduce the Cournot (1836) model of oligopoly, in the next chapter the
Bertrand model, and then in Chapter 11 the Stackelberg model.


9.1 STRATEGIC INTERACTION: INTRODUCTION
TO GAME THEORY


In game theory, each player’s decision or plan of action is called a _strategy_ . A list
of strategies showing one particular strategy choice for each player is called a _strategy_
_combination_ . Any given strategy combination determines the _outcome_ of the game, which
describes the payoffs or final net gains earned by each player. In the context of oligopoly
theory, these payoffs are naturally interpreted as each firm’s profit.

For a game to be interesting, at least one player must be able to choose from more
than one strategy so that there will be more than one possible _strategy combination_, and
thus more than one possible outcome to the game. Yet while there may be many possible
outcomes, not all of these will be _equilibrium_ outcomes. By equilibrium we mean a _strategy_
_combination_ such that no firm has an incentive to _change_ the strategy it is currently using


216 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


given that no other firm changes its current strategy. If this is the case, then the combination
of strategies across firms will remain unaltered because no one is changing his or her
behavior. The market or game will come to rest. Nobel Laureate John Nash developed this
notion of an equilibrium strategy combination for a noncooperative game. In his honor, it
is commonly referred to as the Nash equilibrium concept. [3]

In the oligopoly models studied in the next three chapters, a firm’s strategy focuses on
either its price choice or its output choice. Each firm chooses either the price it will set for
its product or how much of that product to produce. A corresponding Nash equilibrium will,
therefore, be either a set of prices, one for each firm, or a set of production levels, again one
for each firm, for which no firm wishes to change its price (quantity) decision given those
of all the other firms.

We note parenthetically here that, unlike the monopoly case, the price strategy outcome
differs from the quantity strategy outcome in oligopoly models. For a monopolist, the
choice of price implies—via the market demand curve—a unique output. In other words,
the monopolist will achieve the same market outcome whether the profit-maximizing price
or the profit-maximizing output is chosen. [4] Matters are different in an oligopoly setting.
When firms interact strategically, the market outcome obtained when each firm chooses the
price will usually differ from the outcome obtained when each firm chooses its output level.
The fact that the outcome depends on whether the rules of the game specify a price strategy
or a quantity strategy is just one of the reasons that the study of oligopoly does not yield a
unique set of theoretical predictions.

Because interaction is the central fact of life for an oligopolist, rational strategic action
requires that such interaction be recognized. For example, when one firm in an oligopoly
market lowers its price, its rivals will notice the effect as they lose customers to the
price-cutter. If these firms then lower their price too, they may win back their original
customers. Because prices have fallen throughout the industry, the quantity demanded at
each firm will increase. However, each firm will now be meeting that demand at a lower
price that earns a lower mark-up. Our assumption that the oligopoly firm is a rational
strategic actor means that the firm will understand and anticipate this chain of events _and_
that the firm will include this information in making the decision of whether or not to lower
prices in the first place.

Our opening story about carbonated beverages is an example of such an interaction,
except that instead of a price decision, Coca-Cola and Pepsi were making product design
choices. In doing so, each forms some idea as to how its rival will react. It would be
_irrational_ for Coke to anticipate no reaction from Pepsi, when, in fact, Coke understands
that not reacting is not in Pepsi’s interest. Similarly, if Coke lowers the price of its soft
drinks, it doesn’t make sense for Coke to hope that Pepsi will continue to charge a high
price if Coke knows that Pepsi would do better to match its price reduction.

How can an oligopolist anticipate what the response of its rivals will be to any specific
action? The best way to make such a prediction is to have information regarding the
structure of the market and the strategy choices available to other firms. In a symmetric


3 Nash shared the 1994 prize with two other game theorists, R. Selten and J. Harsanyi. The award to the
three game theorists served as widely publicized recognition of the importance game theory has achieved
as a way of thinking in economic analysis. See Schelling’s (1960) seminal work for much of the intuitive
foundation of strategic analysis.
4 Competitive firms have no option as to which choice variable—price or quantity—to select. Competitive
firms by definition cannot make a price choice. They are price-takers and can only choose the quantity of
output they sell.


Static Games and Cournot Competition 217


situation in which all firms are identical, such information is readily available. Any one firm
can proceed by asking itself, “What would I do if I were the other player?” Sometimes, even
when firms are not symmetric, they will still have enough experience, business “savvy,”
or other information to be fairly confident regarding their rivals’ behavior. As we shall
see later, precisely what information firms have about each other is a crucial element
determining the final outcome of the game.

Another crucial element in determining the outcome of the game is the time-dimension of
the strategic interaction. In a two-firm oligopoly or _duopoly_, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi,
we can imagine that one firm, say Coca-Cola, makes its choice to introduce _Vanilla Coke_
first. Then in the next period, the other firm, Pepsi, follows with its choice. In that case, the
strategic interaction is _sequential_ . Each firm moves in order and each, when its turn comes,
must think strategically about how the course of action it is about to choose will affect the
future action of the other firm and how those _re_ actions will then feed back on its own future
choices. Chess and Checkers are each a classic example of a two-person, sequential game.
Sequential games are often called dynamic games.

Alternatively, both players might make their choices _simultaneously_, thereby acting
without knowledge as to what the other player has actually done. [5] Yet even though the other
player’s choice is unknown, knowledge of the strategy choices available to the other player
permits a player to think rationally and strategically about what other players will choose.
The childhood game, “Rock-Paper-Scissors” is an example of a simultaneous two-person
game. Such simultaneous games are often called static games.

Whether the game is sequential or simultaneous, the requirement that the strategic firm
rationally predicts the choices of its rivals is the same. Once it has done this, the firm
may then choose what action is in its own best interest. In other words, being rational
means that the firm’s choice of strategy is the optimal (profit-maximizing) choice against
the anticipated optimal actions of its rivals. When each firm does this, and when each has,
as a result of rational strategizing, correctly predicted the choice of the others, we will
obtain a Nash equilibrium. In this chapter we will focus on solving for Nash equilibria in
simultaneous or static games.


9.2 DOMINANT AND DOMINATED STRATEGIES


Sometimes Nash equilibria are rather easy to determine. This is because some of a firm’s
possible strategies may be _dominated_ . For example, suppose that we have two firms in a
market, A and B, and that one of A’s strategies is such that it is _never_ a profit-maximizing
strategy regardless of the choice made by B. That is, there is always an alternative strategy
for firm A that yields higher profits than does the strategy in question. Then we say that the
strategy in question is dominated. It will never rationally be chosen. Player A would never
choose a dominated strategy because to do so would be to guarantee that A’s profit was
not maximized. No matter what B does, the dominated strategy does worse for A than one
of A’s other strategies. In turn, this means that in determining the game’s equilibrium, we
do not have to worry about any strategy combinations that include the dominated strategy.
Because these will never occur, they cannot possibly be part of the equilibrium outcome.


5 The important aspect of simultaneous games is not that the firms involved actually make their decisions at
the same time. Rather, it is that no firm can _observe_ any other firm’s choice before making its own. This
lack of information makes the actions of each firm effectively simultaneous.


218 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


Dominated strategies can be eliminated one by one. Once the dominated strategies for
one firm have been eliminated, we can turn to the other firms to see if any of their strategies
are dominated given the strategies still remaining for the first firm that we examined. We
can proceed firm-by-firm, eliminating all dominated strategies until only non-dominated
ones remain available to each player. Often but not always, this iterative procedure of
eliminating dominated strategies leaves one or more players with only one strategy choice
remaining. [6] It is then a simple matter to determine the game’s outcome because, for such
firms, their course of action is clear.

As an example, consider the case of two airlines, Delta and American, each offering a
daily flight from Boston to Budapest. We assume that each firm has already set a price for
the flight but that the departure time is still undecided. Departure time is the strategy choice
in this game. We also assume that the two firms choose departure times simultaneously.
Neither can observe the departure time selected by the other before it makes its own
departure time selection. Managers for each airline do realize, however, that at the very
time American’s managers are meeting to make their choice, Delta’s managers are as well.
The two firms are engaged in a strategic game of simultaneous moves.

In part, the choice of departure time will depend upon consumer preferences. Suppose
that market research has shown that 70 percent of the potential clientele for the flight
would prefer to leave Boston in the evening and arrive in Budapest the next morning. The
remaining 30 percent prefer a morning Boston departure and arrival in Budapest late in the
evening of the same day. Both firms know this distribution of consumer preferences. Both
also know that, if the two airlines choose the same flight time, they split the market. Profits
at each carrier are directly proportional to the number of passengers carried so that each
wishes to maximize its share of the market.

If they are rational and strategic, Delta’s managers will reason as follows: If American
flies in the morning, then we at Delta can either fly at night and serve 70 percent of the
market or, like American, depart in the morning in which case we (Delta) will serve 15
percent of the market (half of the 30 percent served by the two carriers in total). On the
other hand, if American chooses an evening flight time, then we at Delta may choose either
a night departure as well, and serve 35 percent (half of 70 percent) of the market or, instead,
offer a morning flight and fly 30 percent of the market.

A little reflection will make clear that Delta does better by scheduling an evening flight
_no matter which departure time American chooses_ . In other words, choosing a _morning_
departure time is a dominated strategy. If Delta is interested in maximizing profits, it will
never select the morning flight option. But of course, American’s managers will reason
similarly. They will recognize that flying at night is their best choice regardless of Delta’s
selection. The only equilibrium outcome for this game is to have both airlines choose an
evening departure time.

Table 9.1 illustrates the logic just described. The table shows four entries, each consisting
of a pair of values. These entries describe the payoffs, or market shares, associated with
the four feasible strategy combinations of the game. American’s strategy choices are
shown as the columns, while Delta’s choices are shown as the rows. The pair of values at
each row-column intersection gives the payoffs to each carrier if that particular strategy
combination occurs. The first (left-hand) value of each pair is the payoff—the percent of


6 If the process continues until only one strategy remains for each player, then we have found an iterated
dominance equilibrium.

the total potential passenger market—that goes to Delta. The second (right-hand) value is
the payoff to American.

Now we put ourselves in the shoes of Delta’s managers and ask first what Delta should
do if American chooses a morning flight. The answer is obvious. If Delta also chooses a
morning flight then Delta’s market share will be 15 percent, whereas if Delta chooses an
evening flight its market share will be 70 percent. The evening flight is clearly the better
choice. Now consider Delta’s response should American choose an evening flight. If Delta
opts for a morning departure, its market share is 30 percent, whereas if it goes for an evening
departure its market share is 35 percent. Once again, the evening departure is the better
choice. In other words, no matter what American does, Delta will never choose to depart
in the morning. Whatever the equilibrium outcome is, it must involve Delta choosing an
evening flight.

If we now place ourselves in American’s shoes, we get the same result. A morning flight
is never American’s rational choice. Just as it was for Delta, flying in the morning is a
dominated strategy for American. Hence, just like Delta, American will always choose the
evening departure time.

The outcome of the game is now fully determined. Both carriers will choose an evening
departure and share equally the 70 percent of the potential Boston-to-Budapest flyers who
prefer that time. That this is a Nash equilibrium is easy to see by virtue of the dominated
strategy argument. Clearly, neither carrier has an incentive to change its choice from
evening to morning because neither carrier would ever choose a morning flight time in
any case.

Solving the flight departure game was easy because each carrier had only two strategies
and for each player one of the strategies—the morning flight—was dominated. To put it
another way, we might refer to the evening departure strategy as _dominant_ . A dominant
strategy is one that outperforms all of a firm’s other strategies _no matter what its rivals do_ .
That is, it leads to higher profits (or sales, or growth, or whatever the objective is) than
any other strategy the firm might pursue regardless of the strategies selected by the firm’s
rivals. This does not imply that a dominant strategy will lead a firm to earn higher profits
than its competitors. It only means that the firm will do the best it possibly can if it chooses
such a strategy. Whether its payoff is as good as, or better than the payoffs obtained by its
rivals depends on the structure of the game.

Except when the number of strategy choices is two, a firm may have some _dominated_
strategies—choices that are never good ones because better ones are available—but not
have any _dominant_ strategies, or a choice that always yields better results than all others.
Sometimes, a firm will have neither a dominant nor a dominated strategy. But for a firm
that has a dominant strategy, the choice is clear. Use it! Such a firm really does not have to
think very much about what other firms do.

Let’s rework the departure time game so that at least one firm has no dominated or
dominant strategy. To do this, we will now suppose that because of a frequent flyer
program, some of the potential Boston-to-Budapest flyers prefer Delta even if the two
carriers fly at the same time. Specifically, assume now that departing at the same time
does not yield an even split of customers between the two carriers. Instead, whenever the
two carriers schedule identical departure times, Delta gets 60 percent of the passengers
and American gets only 40 percent. Table 9.2 depicts the new payoffs for each strategy
combination.

As can be seen from the table, an evening flight is still the dominant strategy for Delta. It
always carries more passengers by choosing an evening flight than it would by choosing a
morning flight, regardless of what American does. However, American’s strategy choices
are no longer so clear. If Delta chooses a morning flight, American should fly at night. But
if Delta chooses an evening departure time, American does better by flying in the morning.

Assuming that each carrier knows the payoffs described by Table 9.2, however, the
game’s outcome remains clear. Looking at the table, American can readily determine that
Delta will always select an evening flight. Knowing that Delta will choose an evening
departure, it is then an easy matter for American to select a morning departure as its best
response. The equilibrium outcome for this modified departure time game is therefore just
as transparent as that for the earlier version. In this case, the equilibrium involves Delta
choosing an evening flight and American opting to fly in the morning. Again, it is easily
verified that this equilibrium satisfies the Nash criteria.

In solving both the previous games, we made extensive use of the ability to rule out
dominated strategies and, when possible, to focus on dominant ones. [7] We showed that
the outcomes obtained by this process were Nash equilibrium outcomes. However in
many games no dominated or dominant strategies can be found. In such cases, the Nash
equilibrium concept becomes more than just a criterion to check our analysis. It becomes
part of the solution procedure itself. This is because rational, strategic firms will use the
Nash concept to determine the reactions of their rivals to their own strategic choice. In the
modified departure time game just described, for instance, Delta can work out that if it
selects an evening departure, then its rival American will choose a morning flight. Delta
can therefore deduce that the strategy combination of both carriers flying at night can never
be an equilibrium—in the Nash sense—because if that outcome occurred, American would
have a clear incentive to change its choice.


7 Some care needs to be taken in ruling out dominated strategies. While one can eliminate _strictly_ dominated
strategies as a rational choice, _weakly_ dominated strategies cannot be so ruled out. A strategy is _weakly_
dominated if there exists some other strategy, which is possibly better but never worse, yielding a higher
payoff in some strategy combinations and never yielding a lower payoff. The Nash equilibrium may be
affected by the order of exclusion of _weakly_ dominated strategies. See Mas-Colell, et al. (1995), 238–41.

9.3 NASH EQUILIBRIUM AS A SOLUTION CONCEPT


In order to understand more deeply how to use the Nash equilibrium concept to solve a
game, let’s change the Boston-to-Budapest game to a game in prices.

Although many price strategies are available to each firm in reality, let’s limit ourselves
here to just three—a low, medium, and high price. This yields nine possible strategy combinations. We will assume that the payoffs (in this case profits) for each such combination
are described by the new airfare game matrix shown in Table 9.3. As is now our convention,
the payoff entries in each row-column intersection show the profit of the row player (Delta)
as the first entry in each case.

We could in principle check each cell of the matrix in Table 9.3 to determine if it satisfies
the Nash equilibrium requirement that neither airline wants to change its strategy. For
example, examination of the upper left-hand corner cell quickly reveals that the strategy
combination _PD_ _PA_ _Low_ is not a Nash equilibrium, because each airline in that case
would want to switch to a medium price. Similarly, the middle cell of the left-hand column = =
with _PD_ _Medium_ and _PA_ _Low_ is not a Nash equilibrium. While Delta cannot improve
its profit given that American is charging a low fare, American would do better by raising = =
its own fare to the medium level given that Delta is already doing just that. If American
followed this inclination, however, it would move the game into the _PA_ _PD_ _Medium_
cell in the middle of the matrix, and it is easy to see that that strategy combination = = _is_ a
Nash equilibrium. Indeed, following this same procedure for all other cells would reveal
that _PA_ _PD_ _Medium_ is the unique Nash equilibrium for this game.

A more appealing approach is to start by identifying that the strategy of setting a high = =
price is never the best strategy for either firm. That is, _PD_ _High_ and _PA_ _High_ are each
dominated strategies for Delta and American, respectively. We can therefore eliminate the = =
third column and third row cells from consideration. Having done that, we are left with
the simple 2 × 2 game in which each firm sets either a low or medium price. Within those
choices however, we now find that _PD_ _Low_ and _PA_ _Low_ are each dominated by,
respectively, _PD_ _Medium_ and _PA_ _Medium_ = . Thus, peeling off the dominated strategies =
as suggested earlier allows us to reach the result that = = _PD_ _PA_ _Medium_ is the unique
Nash equilibrium for this game. = =

The fact that there are a number of ways of identifying the Nash equilibrium for any
game suggests that behind each is a common but deeper meaning of the Nash concept.
This more fundamental insight may be made clear by noting that if players are rational, we
would not expect the game above to evolve along the path suggested by our first solution
technique in which both firms start by setting _PD_ _PA_ _Low_, followed by Delta choosing
_PD_ _Medium_ and then American doing the same thing. Instead, given the fact that both = =
players know the above payoff matrix and the rules of the game, each should choose a =
medium price right from the start. Why? Consider again Delta’s management. Looking at

the game, they can see that American will never set _PA_ _High_ . Thus, recognizing that
_PA_ _High_ is a dominated strategy allows Delta to restrict American’s possible choices to =
either = _PA_ _Low_ or _PA_ _Medium_ . However, further consideration reveals that American
would only ever choose = = _PA_ _Low_ if it thought that Delta was going to set _PD_ _High_,
for if Delta chooses a low or medium price, American does better by choosing a medium = =
price as well. Yet it is not rational for American ever to think that Delta would choose
_PD_ _High_ because looking at the same table, American can see that whether it sets a low
or medium price, Delta always does best by choosing = _PD_ _Medium_ . Therefore, it would
be foolish for American ever to set _PA_ _Low_ . Thus, Delta can set = _PD_ _Medium_ with
a complete confidence that American will do the same thing and, more importantly, that = =
when Delta’s choice of a medium price is revealed, the predicted American strategy of
_PA_ _Medium_ is in fact precisely the choice American would want to make given Delta’s
choice of = _PD_ _Medium_ . Of course, American can follow the exact same reasoning. As
a result, each firm will select a medium pricing strategy from the start. There will be no =
action and reaction that eventually converge to the _PD_ _PA_ _Medium_ combination. It is
this deeper logical consistency—the fact that each firm’s strategy choice reflects its best = =
response to the choice predicted for its rival which, in turn, is the rival’s best response to
the firm’s own selected strategy—that gives the Nash equilibrium concept its true power.

9.4 STATIC MODELS OF OLIGOPOLY: THE COURNOT MODEL


All the games of the previous section are single period or static. Delta and American, for
example, are assumed to choose either their departure times or their airfares simultaneously
and without regard to the possibility that, at some later date, they might play the game again.
This is a feature of earlier work on modeling oligopoly markets. Firms in these models
“meet only once” and the market clears once-and-for-all. There is no sequential movement
over time and no repetition of the interaction. These may be limitations. Yet the analysis is
still capable of generating important insights. Moreover, studying such static models is a
good preparation for later examining dynamic models.

The most well known static oligopoly models are the Cournot and Bertrand models,
each named after its respective author. Both works were completed in the 19th century,
hence these models were not expressed in the formal language of modern game theory.
Nevertheless, the equilibrium proposed by the author of each model fully anticipates the


Static Games and Cournot Competition 223


Nash concept. Indeed, for this reason one often sees that outcome referred to as the
Cournot-Nash or the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium in tribute to these two early scholars and
their anticipation of Nash’s result. Presenting both models also helps us to underscore a
critical point that should be recognized by game theory students everywhere, namely, that
the rules of the game matter _. . ._ a lot. The rules for the Cournot and Nash game are identical
in all respects except for the variable of strategic choice. In the Cournot model, that variable
is the firm’s output level, whereas in the Bertrand model it is price. Yet this seemingly
small change has enormous implications for the outcome of the game.

Augustin Cournot, a French mathematician, published his model in 1836. Although its
insights remained largely unrecognized for the next 100 years, it is now at the foundation of
models of oligopolistic markets. The story that Cournot told to motivate his analysis went as
follows. Assume a single firm wishes to enter a market currently supplied by a monopoly.
The entrant is able to offer a product that is identical in all respects to that of the incumbent
monopolist and to produce it at the same unit cost. Entry is attractive because under the
assumption of constant and identical costs, we know that the monopolist is producing where
price is greater than marginal cost, which means that the price also exceeds the marginal
cost of the would-be entrant. Hence, the entrant firm will see that it can profitably sell
some amount in this market. However the new entrant will, Cournot reasoned, choose an
output level that maximizes its profit, _after taking account of the output being sold by the_
_monopolist_ .

Of course, if entry occurred and the new firm produced its chosen output, the monopolist
would react. Before entry, the monopolist chose a profit-maximizing output assuming no
other rivals. Now, the former monopolist will have to re-optimize and choose a new level.
In so doing, the monopolist will (as did the new entrant previously) choose an output level
that maximizes profits _given the output sold by the new rival firm_ .

This process of each firm choosing an output conditional on the other’s output choice is to
be repeated—at least as a mental exercise. For every output choice by the incumbent, firm
1, the entrant, firm 2, is shown to have a unique, profit-maximizing response and vise-versa.
Cournot called the graph representations of these responses Reaction Curves. Each firm has
its own Reaction Curve that can be graphed in the _q_ 1 _q_ 2 quadrant. That Cournot anticipated
Nash is evidenced by the fact that he described the equilibrium outcome of this process
as that pair of output levels at which each firm’s output choice is the profit-maximizing
response to the other’s quantity. Otherwise, Cournot reasoned, at least one firm would wish
to change its production level. A further appealing aspect of Cournot’s duopoly model is
that the equilibrium price resulting from the output choices of the two firms is below that of
the pure monopoly outcome. Yet it is also greater than that which would occur if there were
not two firms but many firms and pure competition prevailed. In other words, the Cournot
model carries the intuitive implication that more competition is better than less.

To present Cournot’s analysis more formally we assume that the industry _inverse_ demand
curve [8] is linear, and can be described by:


_P_ _A_ _BQ_ _A_ _B(q_ 1 _q_ 2 _)_ (9.1)
=  - =  - +

where _Q_ is the sum of each firm’s production, i.e., the total amount sold on the market;
_q_ 1 is the amount of output chosen by firm 1, the incumbent firm; and _q_ 2 is the amount of

volume of output offered to a specific price. See also Wolfram (1999).

**Figure 9.1** Firm 2’s demand curve in the Cournot duopoly game depends on firm 1’s output

output chosen by firm 2, the new competitor. As noted earlier, we shall also assume that
each firm faces the same, constant marginal cost of production, _c_ .

If we now consider firm 2 alone, and take firm 1’s output, _q_ 1, as given, the inverse
demand curve, facing firm 2 is:


_P_ _A_ _Bq_ 1 _Bq_ 2 (9.2)
=  -  
which is formally identical to (9.1). However, from firm 2’s perspective, the first two terms
on the right-hand side are not part of its decision-making, and can be taken as given. In other
words, those two terms together form the intercept of firm 2’s perceived demand curve so
that firm 2 understands that the only impact _its_ output choice has on price is given by the
last term of the equation, namely, _Bq_ 2. Note, however, that any change in the anticipated
             output choice of the firm would be communicated to firm 2 by means of a shift in firm 2’s
perceived demand curve. Figure 9.1 illustrates this point.

As we can see from Figure 9.1, a different choice of output by firm 1 will imply a different
demand curve for firm 2 and, correspondingly, a different profit-maximizing output for
firm 2. Thus, for each choice of _q_ 1 there will be a different optimal level of _q_ 2. We can solve
for this relationship algebraically, as follows. Associated with each demand curve illustrated
in Figure 9.1 there is a marginal revenue curve that is twice as steeply sloped as discussed
in Chapter 2. That is, firm 2’s marginal revenue curve is also a function of _q_ 1 given by:


_MR_ 2 _(A_ _Bq_ 1 _)_ 2 _Bq_ 2 (9.3)
=   -   
Marginal cost for each firm is constant at _c_ . Setting marginal revenue _MR_ 2 equal to
marginal cost _c,_ as required for profit-maximization, and solving for _q_ 2 [∗] [yields firm 2’s]



marginal cost _c,_ as required for profit-maximization, and solving for _q_ 2 [∗] [yields firm 2’s]

that the relationship is a negative one. Every increase in firm 1’s output lowers firm 2’s
demand and marginal revenue curves and, with a constant marginal cost, also lowers firm
2’s profit-maximizing output.


Static Games and Cournot Competition 225


Of course, matters work both ways. We may symmetrically re-work the industry demand
curve to show that firm 1’s individual demand depends similarly on firm 2’s choice of
output, so that as _q_ 2 changes, so does the profit-maximizing choice of _q_ 1. Then, we may
analogously derive firm 1’s Reaction Curve giving its best choice of _q_ 1 for each alternative
possible value of _q_ 2. By symmetry with firm 2, this is given by:

The Reaction Curve for each firm is shown in Figure 9.2 in which the strategic variables
for each firm and firm outputs are on the axes.



Consider first, the Reaction Curve of firm 1, the initial monopolist. This curve says that



if firm 2 produces nothing, then firm 1 should optimally produce quantity _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_



if firm 2 produces nothing, then firm 1 should optimally produce quantity, which

2 _B_
is, in fact, the pure monopoly level, at which we assumed firm 1 to be producing in the first
place. Now consider the Reaction Curve for firm 2. That curve shows that if firm 1 were



producing at the assumed level of _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_

As Cournot understood, none of the output or strategy combinations just described
corresponds to an equilibrium outcome. In each case, the reaction of one firm is based upon
a choice of output for the other firm that is not, itself, that other firm’s best reaction to the
initial chooser’s selection. For the outcome to be an equilibrium, it must be the case that
each firm is responding optimally to the (optimal) choice of its rival. For that to be the case

As Figure 9.2 makes clear, the Cournot duopoly model just presented has a unique
Nash equilibrium. Unfortunately, Cournot’s original discussion somewhat obscures the
underlying Nash insight that we emphasized earlier. In particular, Cournot’s story suggests
a kind of trial-by-error learning process by which the two firms act and react and thereby
move along their Reaction Curves until the equilibrium is achieved. But the power of the
Nash equilibrium is that it makes it unnecessary to play out such an iterative procedure in
real time. If the entrant, firm 2, is rational and strategic then in choosing its own production
level, it _must anticipate_ that the incumbent, firm 1, will do whatever maximizes its profits.
An expectation, for instance, by firm 2 that the incumbent will continue to produce the



monopoly output _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_




[ −] _[c)]_ after firm 2 enters and produces _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_

monopoly output after firm 2 enters and produces is not a rational

expectation as that is not firm 1’s best response to the production choice by firm 2. That



is, firm 2 ought never to predict _q_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_

. The only rationally prediction that firm 2

can possibly make is in fact that _q_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_

the value of _q_ 1 in the Nash equilibrium. For

level, too. In turn, this output choice by firm 2 is such that firm 1 should indeed produce

world trials and errors. For this reason, many economists, including the authors of this book,
prefer to use the term “ _best response function_ ” instead of “Reaction Curve.” The point is


Static Games and Cournot Competition 227


to emphasize that the correct Nash interpretation of the Cournot model is not one of action
and reaction but one in which equilibrium is achieved directly by each seller’s recognition
that its choices be logically consistent. [10]

As a numeric example, consider two firms, Untel and Cyrox, who supply the market for
computer chips for toaster ovens. Untel’s chips are perfect substitutes for Cyrox’s chips and
vice versa. Market demand for chips is estimated to be _P_ = 120 − 20 _Q_, where _Q_ is the
total quantity (in millions) of chips bought. Both firms have a constant marginal cost equal
to 20 per unit of output. Untel and Cyrox independently choose what quantity of output to
produce. The price then adjusts to clear the market of the total quantity of chips produced.
What quantity of output will Untel produce? What quantity of output will Cyrox produce?
What will be the price of computer chips and how much profit will each firm make?

Let’s put ourselves on the management team at Untel to see the problem from its
perspective. The demand curve that Untel faces can be written as _P_ 120 20 _qc_ 20 _qu_,
where _qc_ is the output of Cyrox and _qu_ is the output of Untel. Untel’s marginal revenue curve = - is _MRu_ 120 20 _qc_ 40 _qu_ . To maximize profit, Untel chooses a quantity of output _qu_ [∗]

such that its marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. That is, 120 = - - 20 40 [ 20.]

history of economic thought. He notes that Cournot’s fate was not quite one of total obscurity owing to his
friendship with the father of the French economist Walras. The English economist Marshall apparently
was also well aware of and influenced by Cournot’s work.

9.5 VARIATIONS ON THE COURNOT THEME: MANY FIRMS
AND DIFFERENT COSTS



Cournot’s model is insightful in its treatment of the interaction among firms and remarkably
modern in its approach. Yet these are not its only strengths. Cournot’s analysis has the further
advantage that, as noted earlier, the results also blend well with economic intuition. In the
simple Cournot duopoly model described above, each firm produces its Nash equilibrium

the monopoly price _P_ _[M]_ _[(A]_ [ +] _[ c)]_
= 2



is less than
3



the monopoly price _P_ _[M]_ but it is higher than the competitive price, _c_, which
= 2

is equal to marginal cost. That is, Cournot’s duopoly model has the intuitively plausible
result that the interaction of two firms yields more industry output at a lower price than
would occur under a monopoly, but less output at a higher price than results under perfect
competition.

It is natural to ask if the foregoing result generalizes to the Cournot model when the
number of firms grows to three, four, or _N_ . That is, would introducing a third firm bring the
industry still closer to the competitive ideal and, if so, would a fourth bring us closer still?
Is the Cournot model consistent with the notion that when there are many firms the price
converges to marginal cost?

The answer to this question is straightforward in the linear demand framework we have
been using. To see this, assume that instead of two there are _N_ identical firms, each
producing the same homogenous good and each with the same, constant marginal cost _c_ .
Industry demand is again given by _P_ = _A_ - _BQN_ where _Q_ is aggregate output. However, _N_

a single firm, say firm 1, as: _P_ _(A_ _Bq_ 2 _Bq_ 3 _..._ _BqN_ _)_ _Bq_ 1. The parenthetical
expression reflects the fact that for firm 1, this sum is beyond its control and merely appears = - - - - as the intercept in firm 1’s demand curve. It is convenient to use the notation _Q_ 1 as a

model industry output is

times the competitive output. This rule, sometimes







called the




_N_
_N_ + 1



rule predicts (correctly) that the monopoly output is 1 _/_ 2 of the



competitive output. As we move to a duopoly, the rule says that industry output rises to 2 _/_ 3
of the competitive output. At three firms, the proportion rises to 3 _/_ 4 and so on. In other
words, our earlier result does generalize. The Cournot market output rises progressively
closer to the competitive output as the number of firms _N_ rises. Likewise close inspection of
the price equation (9.14) reveals that the equilibrium Cournot price correspondingly moves
progressively closer to the competitive equilibrium price _P_ = _c_ as _N_ rises.

In short, the Cournot model implies that as the number of identical firms in the market
grows, the industry equilibrium gets closer and closer to that prevailing under perfect
competition. That is, for this symmetric case, the Cournot model has the appealing feature
that it predicts market outcomes will improve as market concentration falls.

What if the firms competing in the market are not identical? Specifically, what if each
firm has a different marginal cost? We first handle this question for the case of two firms.
Assume that the marginal costs of firm 1 are _c_ 1 and of firm 2 are _c_ 2. We use the same
approach as before with the duopoly model, starting with the demand function for firm 1,
which we can write as:


_P_ _(A_ _Bq_ 2 _)_ _Bq_ 1
=  -  
The associated marginal revenue function is _MR_ 1 _(A_ _Bq_ 2 _)_ 2 _Bq_ 1.

As before, firm 1 maximizes profit by equating marginal revenue with marginal cost. =  -  Thus setting _MR_ 1 = _c_ 1 and solving for _q_ 1 gives the best response function for firm 1 as:

By an exactly symmetric argument, the best response function for firm 2 is:

(9.15b)

Notice that the only difference from our initial analysis of the Cournot model is that now
each firm’s best response function reflects its own specific marginal cost.

An important feature of these best response functions that is obscured when the firms
are identical is that the _position_ of each firm’s best response function is affected by its
marginal cost. For example, if the marginal cost of firm 2 increases from say, _c_ 2 to _c_ 2 [′] [, its]

best response curve will shift inwards.

Figure 9.3 illustrates this point. It shows the best response function for each firm assuming
initially that each firm has identical costs as in Figure 9.2. It then shows what happens when
firm 2’s unit cost rises. As equation (9.15b) makes clear, this cost increase _lowers_ firm
2’s best output response for any given level of _q_ 1. That is, it shifts firm 2’s best response
curve inward. This change in firm 2’s best response function affects the equilibrium outputs
that the two firms will choose. As you can see from the diagram, an increase in firm 2’s

marginal cost leads to a new equilibrium in which firm 1 produces more than it did in the
initial equilibrium and firm 2 produces less. This makes intuitive sense. We should expect
that low-cost firms will generally produce more than high-cost firms. The changes are not
offsetting, however. Firm 2’s output falls by more than firm 1’s production rises so that the
new equilibrium is characterized by less output in total than was the original equilibrium.
(Can you say why?)

It is easy to check that the relative outputs of these two firms are determined by the
relative magnitudes of their marginal costs. The firm with the lower marginal costs will
have the higher output.

Let’s return to our Untel and Cyrox example of the two firms who produce computer
chips for toaster ovens but now change this story a bit. While we still assume that Untel’s
chips are perfect substitutes for Cyrox’s chips and vice versa, we no longer assume that they
have identical costs. Instead, we now assume that Untel is the low-cost firm with a constant
unit cost of 20, and Cyrox is the high-cost producer with a constant unit cost of 40. Market
demand for chips is still estimated to be _P_ = 120 − 20 _Q_, where _Q_ is the total quantity


232 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


(in millions) of chips bought. What now happens when Untel and Cyrox independently
choose the quantity of output to produce? What quantity of output will Untel produce?
What quantity of output will Cyrox produce?

Again we put ourselves on the management team at Untel to see the problem from
Untel’s perspective. The demand curve that Untel faces is still _P_ 120 20 _qc_ 20 _qu_,
where _qc_ is the output of Cyrox and _qu_ is the output of Untel. Untel’s marginal revenue = - is again _MRu_ 120 20 _qc_ 40 _qu_ . To maximize profit, Untel should sell a quantity of
output _qu_ [∗] [such that at that quantity marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. That is,] = -

Untel’s profit-maximizing choice of output still depends on the output that the higher
cost rival, Cyrox, chooses to produce. Equally importantly, a comparison of equation
(9.16) with (9.6) indicates that Untel’s best response function is unaffected by the assumed
increase in Cryox’s marginal cost. What about Cryox? By the same argument, the demand
curve that Cryox faces is _MRc_ = 120 − 20 _qu_ - 40 _qc P_ . Equating this with marginal cost of 40 and solving for = 120 − 20 _qu_ - 20 _qc_ and its marginal revenue curve is _qc_ gives

Untel knows that higher cost Cyrox is also a profit maximizer and therefore anticipates

Although the foregoing analysis is limited to just two firms, it still yields important [=][ 2.]
insights. First, there is a disadvantage to being a high-cost firm. It means a smaller market
share and less profit. Second, while the disadvantage is real it is not fatal. A high-cost
firm is not driven out of business, It is simply less successful than its ost rival. Finally,
when costs vary across firms, the equilibrium Cournot output _Q_ [∗] is not only too low
(i.e., less than the competitive level), it is also produced inefficiently. As we know from


Static Games and Cournot Competition 233


Chapter 4, efficient production among two or more firms would allocate output such
that, in the final configuration, each firm’s marginal cost is the same. This would be
the outcome, for example, if the industry were comprised of a single, profit maximizing
multiplant monopolist. It will also obtain under perfect competition. However, the noncooperative feature of the Cournot-Nash equilibrium means that firms’ marginal costs are
not equalized. [11] Hence, the output allocation at equilibrium when costs are different is not
an efficient one.


case in which Untel is the low-cost producer and Cyrox the high-cost one? Compare your
answers to the ones you work out when the two firms are identical and have a constant unit
cost of 20.


9.6 CONCENTRATION AND PROFITABILITY IN THE COURNOT
MODEL


Let’s now try to combine the case of many firms together with the assumption of _non_ identical costs. That is, let’s analyze the Cournot model with _N_ firms, each with its own
(constant) marginal cost such that the marginal cost of firm _i_ is _ci_ . We can use the first order
condition for profit-maximization for each firm _i_, equation (9.8), and substitute _ci_ for _c_ in
this equation. This gives us the following:





_A_ - _BQ_ - _i_ - 2 _Bqi_ [∗] [−] _[c]_ _i_ [=][ 0] (9.18)

where _Q_ _i_ again is shorthand for the industry production accounted for by all firms other

   than the _i_ th one.

In a Nash equilibrium, the equilibrium output _qi_ [∗] _[for each firm][ i]_ [ must satisfy the first-order]

profit-maximizing condition. Hence, in the Nash equilibrium, the term _Q_ _i_ must be the

                           sum of the _optimal_ outputs _q_ [∗] [for each of the “not] _[ i]_ [” firms. Denote this equilibrium sum as]



In a Nash equilibrium, the equilibrium output _q_ [∗]

obtained for the more general presentation in which the marginal cost of firm _i_, _ci_, is a general function
of its output, _q_ i, as in _ci_ _ci_ ( _qi_ ).

234 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


We also know that the Nash equilibrium price, _P_ [∗], is obtained by substituting the Nash
equilibrium output into the industry demand curve yielding, _P_ [∗] = _A_ - _BQ_ [∗] . Substitution
into equation (9.20) then yields:



_P_ [∗] - _ci_ = _Bqi_ [∗]



_i_ [∗] (9.21)



Dividing both sides of equation (9.21) by _P_ [∗] and multiplying the right-hand side by _[Q]_ [∗]



we obtain:



_Q_ [∗] [,]



_P_ [∗] - _ci_

where _s_ [∗]



_i_
_Q_ [∗] [is the] _[ i]_ [th firm’s market share in equilibrium.]



Let’s consider equation (9.22) step-by-step. The left-hand-side term is the difference
between the price and firm _i_ ’s marginal cost as a proportion of market price. This is just the
_Lerner Index of Monopoly Power_ that we met in Chapter 3. The notion is that the greater
firm _i_ ’s market power, the greater its ability to keep price above marginal cost.

The right-hand-side of (9.22) has two terms. The first is the slope of industry demand
curve times the ratio of industry output to price. But the slope is just _[BQ]_ _[P]_ _B_ = − _�P/�Q_ so



that we have _[BQ]_ [∗]

_P_ [∗] [= −] _�_ _[�]_ _Q_ _[P]_



_Q_ [. So the first term on the right-hand side of equation (9.22) is just the inverse]



of the price elasticity of demand. The second term is just the market share of the _i_ th firm, that
is, its output relative to total industry output. Hence, equation (9.22) may be rewritten as:



_ci_ _i_

 - _[s]_ [∗]

_P_ = _η_

[∗]



_P_ [∗] - _ci_



_i_ (9.23)
_η_



where _η_ is the price elasticity of industry demand.

Equation (9.23) is a further implication of the Cournot model, now extended to allow for
many firms with differing costs. What it says is this: A firm that produces in an industry
where demand is relatively inelastic and where it has a relatively large market share will
also be a firm with a substantial degree of market power as measured by the Lerner Index
or the firm’s price-marginal cost distortion.

The relationship described in equation (9.23) tells us about market power at the level
of the firm. In Chapter 3, we discussed the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) paradigm
in industrial organization that linked market power, as measured by the Lerner Index,
to the structure of the _industry_ . The question that remains is whether we can extend the
relationship in equation (9.23) at the firm level to the level of the entire industry.

To see how, let’s first multiply each side of equation (9.23) by the firm’s market share,
_si_ [∗][. Then add together the modified equation for firm 1 with that for firm 2 and that for firm]

3 and so on until we add together all _N_ modified (9.23) equations. The left-hand side of this

where _HI_ is the Herfindahl Index that we defined as a measure of concentration in Chapter

Therefore equation (9.23) aggregated at the level of the industry implies that: =

Our generalized Cournot model thus gives theoretical support for the view that as concentration (here measured by the industry’s Herfindahl Index) increases, prices also rise further
and further above marginal cost.

A variant of the relationship in equation (9.24) was tested in Marion et al. (1979) for food
products. They collected price data for a basket of ninety-four grocery products, and market
share data for thirty-six firms operating in thirty-two US Standard Metropolitan Statistical
Areas, and found that price is significantly higher in markets with a higher Herfindahl
Index. Likewise, Marvel (1989) found that for twenty-two US cities, concentration in the
retail market for gasoline, as measured by the Herfindahl Index, had a significant impact on
the average price of gasoline.


236 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


9.7 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: COURNOT COMPETITION
IN AN AIRLINE DUOPOLY


The examples above suggest that at least some of the implications of the Cournot model
are consistent with real world data. However, such results might also be compatible with
other models as well that differ in an important respect from the precise assumptions of the
Cournot model presented in this chapter. One such difference concerns the Cournot firm’s
understanding of how rivals will react to its output choice.

Consider again the basic duopoly model with a linear demand curve: _P_ = _A_  - _BQ_ . As
before, assume as well that each firm has a constant marginal cost _ci_ . As we described
above, the industry demand perceived by each firm is described by _P_ _A_ _Bq_ 1 _Bq_ 2.
Consider firm 1. The Cournot model hypothesis is that in calculating the impact of changes = - in its output, i.e., in calculating its marginal revenue, firm 1 assumes that firm 2’s output
is unchanged. Hence, as in equation (9.3), the profit-maximizing output for firm 1 satisfies
MR1 _A_ _Bq_ 2 2 _Bq_ 1 _c_ . However, we want to write this equation slightly differently
to make a key point of the Cournot model. Recognizing that = - - = _A_ _Bq_ 1 _Bq_ 2 _P_, we can
rewrite firm 1’s profit-maximizing condition as follows: - - =



_P_ _q_ 1 _B_ _c_ (9.25)
 - =







The term _B_ = –




_�P_



_�Q_



is of course the slope term that simply characterizes the (negative)



effect on the industry price of changes in industry output. Its presence reflects the fact
that when firm 1 makes a small marginal increase in its own output, _�q_ 1, the Cournot
assumption that _q_ 2 does not change implies that _�Q_ = _�q_ 1 so that the resultant fall in price
is B. Multiplying this over firm 1’s current output then captures the downside of further
increases in _q_ 1. Similarly, the Cournot model assumes firm 2 also expects no reaction to a
small change in its output _q_ 2 so that it perceives _�Q_ = _�q_ 2.

It is possible, however, that instead of no response each firm anticipates that its rival will
adjust its output as the initial firm changes its own production. That is, firm 1 may believe
is nowthat _�q �_ 2 = _Q v�q (_ 11 so that when firm 1 changes its output, the total change in industry output _v) �q_ 1. Likewise, firm 2 may believe that _�Q_ _(_ 1 _v) �q_ 2. As a
= + = +
result, the movement in price from a small increase at the margin in firm 1’s output will
be _B(_ 1 + _v)_ . Hence, the profit-maximizing first-order condition in equation (9.25) now
becomes:



_P_ _q_ 1 _B(_ 1 _v)_ _c_ (9.26a)
  - + =

Symmetrically, firm 2’s profit maximizing condition is now:


_P_ _q_ 2 _B(_ 1 _v)_ _c_ (9.26b)
  - + =

Because the parameter _v_ reflects the firm’s conjecture regarding the output response their
own choices will induce, it is often referred to as the conjectural variations parameter. With
a little intuition, we can use equations (9.26a) and (9.26b) to put some bounds on the values
that _v_ can take. In this regard, observe that if _v_ = −1, the two equations imply _P_ = _c_ . That
is, _v_ = −1 corresponds to perfect competitive behavior in which price is driven to marginal
cost. To see the implication if _v_ = 1, recall from Chapter 2 that the monopoly output

bound of _v_ = −1 reflecting perfectly competitive behavior and an upper bound of _v_ = +1
reflecting cartel or monopoly behavior. The intermediate value of _v_ = 0 reflects Cournot
behavior.

238 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


Let us now allow for the two firms to have different marginal costs _ci_ and therefore
different market shares _si_ . Then recognizing that firm _i_ ’s output _qi_ _siQ_ we may generalize
equations (9.25a) and (9.25b) as follows: =



_P_ _siQB(_ 1 _vi)_ _ci_ _i_ 1,2 (9.27)

Brander and Zhang (1990) use data from thirty-three airline routes emanating from
Chicago in the 1980s that were served by just the two carriers, American Airlines and
United Airlines. Their baseline case uses an assumed elasticity of _η_ = 1.6 (based on other
research) and marginal cost estimates derived from the operating expenses for each firm
(including an allowance for marginal cost to vary with the length of the flight with an
elasticity of 0.5). Their calculated _vi_ values for each firm in each market are shown in
Table 9.4 above.

The rough calculation behind these measures implies that they will include a fair bit
of noise. Even so, the overwhelming majority or 57 of the 66 estimated _vi_ parameters lie
within the theoretical upper and lower bounds of 1 and −1. More importantly, the estimated
mean is very close to 0 for both firms and across the entire sample. Classical statistical
tests would reject the null hypothesis that _v_ equals either 1 or −1 They would not reject the
Cournot hypothesis that _v_ = 0. Thus, this rough exercise gives fairly strong support to the
Cournot model as a useful description of real world behavior.


**Summary**



For industries populated by a relatively small
number of firms, strategic interaction is a fact of
life. Each firm is aware of the fact that its decisions have a significant impact on its rivals. Each
firm will want to take account of the anticipated
response of its rivals when determining its course
of action. It is reasonable to believe that firms’
anticipations or expectations are rational.

Game theory is the modern formal technique
for studying rational strategic interaction. Each
player in a game has a set of strategies to
choose from. A strategy combination is a set
of strategies—one for each player. Each such
strategy combination implies a particular payoff
or final outcome for each player. A Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination such that each
player is maximizing his or her own payoff _given_
the strategies chosen by all other players. In a



Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to
change behaviors unilaterally.

In this chapter, we presented the well-known
Cournot model of competition. It is a static or single market period model of oligopoly. Although
this model was developed prior to the development of formal game theory, the outcome
proposed by Cournot captures basic game theoretic principles, specifically the Nash equilibrium
solution.

The Cournot model makes clear the importance of firms recognizing and understanding
their interdependence. The model also has the
nice intuitive implication that the degree of departure from competitive pricing may be directly
linked to the structure of the industry as measured by the Herfindahl Index. While the Cournot
model is not the only game-theoretic model of
