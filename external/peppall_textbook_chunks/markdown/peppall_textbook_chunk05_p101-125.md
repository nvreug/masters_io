As the scale economy index _S_ is defined as the ratio of average cost to marginal cost, it
follows that: _S_ 1 _/ηC_ .

RAY AVERAGE COST AND MULTIPRODUCT SCALE ECONOMIES


Scale economies are indicated by declining average cost, or declining Ray Average Cost
(RAC) for a multiproduct firm. If a firm has 2 products so that its cost function is
_C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ we may implicitly define total output _q_ by the equations _q_ 1 _λ_ 1 _q,_ and _q_ 2
_λ_ 2 _q_, where + _λ_ 1 and _λ_ 2 sum to unity. Then ray average cost is: = =


_RAC(q)_ _[C][(λ]_ [1] _[q][, λ]_ [2] _[q][)]_ [ +] _[ F]_ (4.A4)
= _q_


Multiproduct scale economies imply that RAC declines as output expands or that

_dq_ = _q_ [2]

where _MCi_ is the marginal cost of producing good _i_ . It follows immediately that the
sign of _dRAC(q)/dq_ is determined by the sign of the numerator of this expression.
In other words, if _q_ 1 _MC_ 1 + _q_ 2 _MC_ 2 _< C(q q_ 1 _MC_ 1 _, q_ 1 +2 _)_ + _q_ 2 _FMC_ then2 _> dRAC C(q_ 1 _, q(q)/dq <_ 2 _)_ + _F_ then 0. Now define the ratio _dRAC(q)/dq >_ 0, while if

(4.A6)



If _S_ _[M]_ _>_ 1 ray average cost decreases with output and so exhibits multiproduct increasing
returns to scale. If _S <_ 1, ray average cost is increasing, and so exhibits multiproduct
decreasing returns to scale. If _S_ = 1, neither scale economies nor diseconomies exist for the
multiproduct firm.


FORMAL COST FUNCTION ANALYSIS AND EMPIRICAL
ESTIMATION: THE COBB-DOUGLAS CASE


Assume that production is generated from capital _K_ and labor _L_ inputs via a Cobb-Douglas
production function:


_Q_ = _K_ _[α]_ _L_ _[β]_ (4.A7)


If _r_ is the rental price of capital and _w_ is the wage rate of labor, then total cost
_C_ = _rK_ + _wL_ . Cost minimization requires choosing the capital and labor inputs that
minimize cost for achieving a given level of output. If we denote the target output level as
~~_Q_~~ ~~,~~ the firm’s problem then becomes:


Minimize _C_ = _rK_ + _wL_ subject to ~~_Q_~~ = _K_ _[α]_ _L_ _[β]_

The exponents for each factor price, _r_ and _w_, sum to unity so that the cost function

is 1 _/(α_ + _β)_ there will be constant returns to scale if _α_ + _β_ = 1; scale economies if
_α_ + _β >_ 1; and scale diseconomies if _α_ + _β <_ 1.

For estimation purposes, this can easily be translated into: ln _C_ = Constant + _δ_ 1 ln _r_ +
_δ_ 2 ln _w_ + _δ_ 3 ln _Q_ . With observations on input prices and output levels, estimation of the
coefficients _δi_ allow us to recover the underlying production parameters, _α_ and _β_ .

If the assumption of Cobb-Douglas technology is incorrect, the estimated coefficients
will not satisfy theoretical restrictions. Hence, empirical analysis often employs a more
flexible specification that includes Cobb-Douglas as a special case. One such specification
is the translog cost function. For the two-input case above, this function is:



ln _C_ = Constant + _δ_ 1 ln _r_ + _δ_ 2 ln _w_ + 0.5[ _δ_ 11 _(_ ln _r)_ [2] + _δ_ 12 _(_ ln _w)(_ ln _r)_

## **Part Two**
# **Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice**

In Part Two, we consider the pure monopoly case in much more detail than the simple,
textbook case presented in Chapter 2. In particular, we consider a single firm facing a
downward-sloping demand curve and the price and non-price tactics that it may use. While
focusing on a single firm omits much strategic interaction, there are some cases in which
this is realistic. In many regions, for example, there is just one ski lift operator within a
radius of fifty miles and only one amusement park serving an even greater area. Second,
and more importantly, the tactics discussed such as quantity discounts and bundling are
also available in a setting of multiple rivals. However, it is much easier to understand the
role of such measures in this more competitive environment _after_ seeing them used by a
single firm with no strategically-linked rival.

Chapter 5 begins with an examination of linear price discrimination tactics, such as
market segmentation. It also includes an analysis of the 2003 study of price discrimination
in new car sales by Scott-Morton, Zettelmeyer, and Silva-Risso. This is followed by a
discussion of nonlinear price discrimination techniques, e.g., two-part tariffs, in Chapter 6.
That chapter also includes a discussion of the evidence on airline price discrimination
presented by Stavins (2001).

In Chapter 7, we explore the choice of product quality. This allows us to introduce
the two concepts of horizontal differentiation, in which consumers disagree about what
makes a high-quality product (but may agree on the value of higher quality), and vertical
differentiation, in which consumers agree about the quality ranking of different goods (but
typically disagree about quality’s marginal value). Both of these concepts, but especially
that of horizontal differentiation, will be used extensively in subsequent chapters. We also
present the empirical analysis of Berry and Waldfogel (2010) linking newspaper quality to
market size.

Chapter 8 reviews the classic techniques of bundling and tie-in sales. Here we consider
not only the surplus-extracting aspects of such tactics, but also their potential for leveraging
market power from one market to another. This permits a discussion of the related (and
extensive) developments in antitrust policy. The chapter concludes with an illustration of
the basic, profit-enhancing effects that bundling can have based on the empirical study by
Crawford (2008) of bundling in cable TV.


### **5** **Price Discrimination and Monopoly:** **Linear Pricing**

The standard definition of price discrimination is that a seller sells the same product to
different buyers at different prices. Examples of price discrimination abound. Consider, for
example, the market for prescription and generic drugs. Both casual and formal empirical
evidence finds that brand name prescription drug prices are on average lower in Canada than
in the United States. Table 5.1 demonstrates this with evidence from two recent studies, one
by Skinner and Rovere (2008) and the other by Quon, Firszt, and Eisenberg (2005). While
the precise drugs covered by each study differ somewhat, the basic conclusion in each is the
same. US consumers pay between 24 percent and 57 percent more for prescription drugs
on average than do their Canadian neighbors.

The case of prescription drugs is far from an isolated example. Passenger airline
companies and hotel chains are past masters at what they euphemistically call “yield
management,” as any frequent traveler can readily attest. In the great majority of businessto-business transactions, prices are arrived at through prolonged negotiation. Sophisticated
travelers who visit the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul know that all prices are negotiable—and
are typically lower if the traveler happens to be accompanied by a native of Istanbul who
does the negotiating! Nearer to home, purchasing a pre-owned automobile usually involves
equally intensive negotiation. In each of these cases of negotiated prices, there is no reason
to believe that the price offered to one buyer will be the same as the price offered to another.

The extensive use of price discrimination by sellers raises two sets of questions. First,
what market conditions make price discrimination feasible? Second, what makes price
discrimination profitable? It is, after all, difficult to believe that discriminatory pricing is
extensively employed but unprofitable! Essentially, our task in this and upcoming chapters
is to analyze the methods firms can use to implement price discrimination in a way that
increases profits relative to charging the same price to everyone.

This raises another important issue. Any increased profit that price discrimination
generates must come either from a reduction in consumer surplus, improved market
efficiency, or some combination of the two. From a policy perspective, it matters a great
deal which of these is the case. As a result, we also want to explore the welfare implications
of price discrimination. Finally, it is worthwhile noting that discriminatory prices can also
affect market competition. This occurs when the buyers are not final consumers but instead,
retailers such as drug stores. If large drug store chains are charged different wholesale
prices than are small, independent pharmacies, then retail competition between these two

groups will not be conducted on a level playing field. We address these issues in the next
group of chapters.


5.1 FEASIBILITY OF PRICE DISCRIMINATION


A firm with market power faces a downward sloping demand curve. So if the firm charges
the same price to each consumer—the standard case of non-discriminatory pricing—the
marginal revenue it gets from selling an additional unit of output is less than the price
charged. In order to sell the additional unit, the firm must lower its price not only to the
consumer who buys the additional unit, but to all its other consumers as well. Having to
lower the price for all its customers in order to gain an additional consumers weakens
the monopolist’s incentive to serve more consumers. As a result, the textbook monopoly
undersupplies its product relative to the efficient outcome.

Non-discriminatory pricing by a monopolist is not just a source of potential inefficiency. It
is also a constraint on the firm’s ability to convert consumer surplus into profit, particularly
from those consumers willing to pay a lot for its product. Price discrimination is a
powerful technique that can greatly increase firm profits. In some cases, moreover, price
discrimination may induce the monopolist to sell more output thereby coming closer to the
competitive outcome and enhancing market efficiency.

While a monopolist can increase profit through price discrimination, it is important to
realize that price discrimination is not always easily accomplished. There is a reason that


94 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


the standard textbook case assumes that each customer pays the same price. To discriminate
successfully, the monopolist must overcome two main obstacles. The first of these is the
_identification problem_ : the firm needs to be able to identify who is who on its market
demand curve. The second is the problem of _arbitrage_ : being able to prevent those who are
offered a low price from reselling to those charged a high price.

In considering the identification problem, it is useful to recall a common assumption in
the textbook monopoly model: that the firm knows the quantity demanded at each price.
Without this knowledge the firm would not know its marginal revenue curve and, hence,
would not be able to determine the profit-maximizing output. Let’s examine more carefully
what this assumption means in practice.

For some products such as bicycles, TVs, DVD players, or haircuts, each consumer
purchases at most one unit of the good over a given period of time. The firm’s market
demand curve is then an explicit ordering of consumers by their reservation prices—the top
price each is willing to pay. For these goods, knowledge of the demand curve means that
the monopolist knows that the top part of the demand curve is made up of those consumers
willing to pay a relatively large amount for the one unit they will purchase, whereas the
bottom part of the demand curve is made up of those willing to pay only a little.

For other products, such as movies, CDs, refreshments, and tennis lessons, the construction of the market demand curve is slightly more complex. This is because each individual
consumer can be expected to purchase an increasing (decreasing) quantity of the good as the
price is reduced (increased). As a result, for these goods the market demand curve reflects
not only differences in the willingness to pay across consumers, but also differences in the
willingness to pay as any one consumer buys more of the product.

When the monopolist practices uniform pricing, these distinctions are not relevant. In
that case, the assumption that the firm knows its demand curve means only that it knows
how willingness to pay for the good _in the overall market_ varies with the quantity of the
good sold. To be able to practice price discrimination, the monopolist must be able to
acquire and exploit more information about consumers than is assumed in the standard
model. The monopolist must know how the market demand curve has been constructed
from the individual consumer demand curves. In other words, the monopolist must know
how different kinds of consumers differ in their demands for its good.

This is easier for some sellers than for others. For example, tax accountants effectively
sell one unit of their services to each client in any given year. Further, they know exactly
how much their clients earn and, more importantly, how much they save their clients by way
of reduced tax liabilities. They can certainly use this information to identify their clients’
willingness-to-pay. Similarly, a car dealer typically sells one car to a customer. The dealer
may be able to identify those buyers with the greatest or least willingness to pay by asking
potential buyers where they live, work, or shop and more generally through the process of
negotiation. The same is often true for realtors, dentists, and lawyers.

Sellers of retail merchandise, however, face a more anonymous market. Various schemes
such as varying the price depending on time of purchase—“early-bird” specials or Saturday
morning sales—or offering coupons that take time to collect, can help retailers identify
“who’s who” on their demand curve. Nevertheless, the identification problem is still difficult
to overcome. Moreover, even if weekend sales or coupon schemes do successfully identify
the firm’s different consumers, such schemes may be too costly to implement.

Even when a monopolist can solve the identification problem, there is still the second
obstacle to price discrimination: arbitrage. As was noted previously, to discriminate
successfully the monopolist must be able to prevent those consumers who are offered a low


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing 95


price from reselling their purchases to other consumers to whom the monopolist wants to
charge a high price. Again, this is more easily accomplished for some goods and services
than for others. Medical, legal, and educational services are not easily resold. One consumer
can’t sell her appendectomy to another! Similarly, a senior citizen cannot easily resell a
discounted movie theater ticket to a teenager. For other markets, particularly consumer
durables such as bicycles and automobiles, resale—or sale across different markets—is
difficult to prevent. This is an important part of the drug pricing story noted at the start of
this chapter. Pharmaceutical companies can only price discriminate successfully if they can
keep the American and Canadian markets separate, in other words, only if they can prevent
arbitrage.

To sum up, we expect firms with monopoly power to try to price discriminate. In
turn, this implies that we should expect these firms to develop techniques by which they
can identify the different types of consumers who buy their goods and prevent resale or
consumer arbitrage among them. The ability to do this and the best strategy for achieving
price discrimination will vary from firm to firm and from market to market.

We now turn to the practice of price discrimination and investigate some of the more
popularly practiced techniques. The tradition in economics has been to classify these
techniques into three broad classes: first degree, second degree, and third degree price
discrimination. [1] More recently, these types of pricing schemes have been referred to
respectively as personalized pricing, menu pricing, and group pricing. [2] In this chapter, we
focus on third-degree price discrimination, or group pricing.


5.2 THIRD-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION OR GROUP
PRICING


Third-degree price discrimination, or group pricing, is defined by three key features. First,
there is some easily observable characteristic such as age, income, geographic location, or
education status by which the monopolist can group consumers in terms of their willingness
to pay for its product. Second, the monopolist can prevent arbitrage across the different
groups. In the prescription drug case with which we started this chapter, this implies that it
is possible to prevent the re-importation to the United States of prescription drugs initially
exported from the United States to Canada. Finally, a central feature of third-degree price
discrimination is that, while the monopolist quotes different unit prices to different groups,
all consumers _within_ a particular group are quoted the same unit price. Consumers in each
group then decide how much to purchase at their quoted price.

Group pricing is an example of price discrimination precisely because the price quoted
to one group of consumers is not the same as the price quoted to another group _for the same_
_good_ . This type of pricing policy is the one most commonly found in economics textbooks
and is referred to in the industrial organization literature as _linear pricing_ —hence the title
of this chapter. Consumers within a group are free to buy as much as they like at the quoted
price, so that the average price per unit paid by each consumer is the same as the marginal
price for the last unit bought.


1 Price discrimination is a fascinating topic and its interest to economists goes well beyond the field of
industrial organization. The distinction between first, second, and third degree discrimination follows the
work of Pigou (1920). A more modern treatment appears in Phlips (1983).
2 These terms were first coined by Shapiro and Varian (1999).

Above $105,000 $40


The world is full of examples of third-degree price discrimination. Senior discounts
and “kids are free” programs are both examples. An interesting case that is familiar to
economists is the fee schedule for membership in the _American Economic Association_,
the major professional organization for economists in the United States. Payment of the
fee entitles a member to receive professional announcements, newsletters, and three very
important professional journals, _The American Economic Review, The Journal of Economic_
_Perspectives_, and _The Journal of Economic Literature_, each of which is published quarterly.

The 2012 fee schedule is shown in Table 5.2. As can be seen, the aim is to price
discriminate on the basis of income. A particularly interesting feature of this scheme is
that the Association makes no attempt to check the veracity of the income declared by a
prospective member. What they appear to rely upon is that economists will be either honest
or even boastful in reporting their income. In addition, the Association must also hope to
avoid the arbitrage problem whereby junior faculty members who pay a low subscription
fee resell to senior faculty members who pay a high one. Casual observation suggests such
reselling is rare.

The practice of the American Economic Association is not unique. Many academic
journals charge a different price to institutions such as university libraries than to individuals.
The print and online 2012 subscription rate to the _Journal of Economics and Management_
_Strategy_, for example, is $59 for an individual but $446 for an institution.

Airlines are particularly adept at applying third-degree price discrimination. It has
sometimes been suggested that the number of different fares charged to Economy class
passengers on a particular flight is approximately equal to the number of passengers! A
common feature of this type of price discrimination is that it is implemented by restrictions
on the characteristics of the ticket. These include constraints upon the time in advance
by which the flight must be booked, whether flights can be changed, the number of days
between departure and return, whether the trip involves staying over a Saturday night, and
so on. We return to the airline case later in this chapter.

Other examples of third-degree price discrimination are restaurant “early bird specials”
and supermarket discounts to shoppers who clip coupons. Similarly, department stores that
lower their apparel prices at the end of the season are attempting to charge a different price
based on the observable characteristic of the time of purchase. [3] Segmenting consumers by
time of purchase is also evident in other markets. Consumers typically pay more to see a
film at a first-run theater when the film is newly released than to see it at a later date at a
second-run cinema or, still later, as a downloaded film at home.


3 Discounting over time in a systematic fashion runs the risk that if consumers know prices will fall in the
future, they will delay their purchases. If the number of customers that postpone is “too” large, seasonal
discounts will not be a very good strategy.


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing 97


An essential feature of all third-degree price discrimination schemes is that the monopolist
has some easily observed characteristic that serves as a good proxy for differences in
consumer willingness to pay. This characteristic can be used effectively to divide the
market into two or more groups, each of which will be charged a different price. The
monopolist must next be able to ensure that resale of the product by those who are offered
a low price to those who are offered a high one is not feasible. Consider the airline example
again. The requirement to stay over a Saturday night is designed to discriminate between
those consumers who are traveling on business and those who are not. Senior discounts
typically require proof of age but this in itself is not necessarily sufficient to prevent
arbitrage. Suppose, for example, that a local supermarket were to offer a senior discount.
Forty- and fifty-somethings who have a senior parent living nearby would then have an
incentive to have their parent purchase the groceries. This is why most senior discounts
require both proof of age _and_ proof of consumption (e.g., theater or movie tickets).

Once the different consumer groups have been identified and separated, the general rule
that characterizes third-degree price discrimination is easily stated. _Consumers for whom_
_the elasticity of demand is low should be charged a higher price than consumers for whom_
_the elasticity of demand is relatively high_ .


5.3 IMPLEMENTING THIRD-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION
OR GROUP PRICING


The logic underlying the pricing rule is fairly straightforward. Here, we illustrate it with a
simple example and defer formal presentation to the Appendix at the end of this chapter.

Suppose that the publishers of J.K Rowling’s final volume in the Harry Potter series,
_Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, estimate that inverse demand for this book in the
are measured in dollars and quantities in millions of books sold at publication of the firstUnited States is _PU_ = 36 − 4 _QU_ and in Europe is _PE_ = 24 − 4 _QE_ . In each case, prices
edition of the book. Marginal cost is assumed to be the same in each market and equal to
$4 per book. The publisher also incurs other costs such as cover design and promotion, but
we treat these as fixed and independent of sales volume and so ignore them in our analysis.

As a benchmark, suppose that the publisher treats the two markets as a single, integrated
market and so quotes the same, nondiscriminatory price to consumers in the United States
and Europe. To work out the profit maximizing price, the publisher first needs to calculate
aggregate market demand at any price _P_ . This means that they need to add the two market
demand curves _horizontally_ . In the United States, we have _P_ 36 4 _QU_, which can be
=                     inverted to give _QU_ 9 _P/_ 4 provided, of course, that _P_ $36. In Europe we have
_P_ demand equation: = 24 − 4 _QE_ so that = _Q_ - _E_ = 6 − _P/_ 4 provided _P_ ≤ $24. This gives us the aggregate ≤


_Q_ _QU_ _QE_ 9 _P/_ 4 for $36 _P_ $24
= + =  - ≥ ≥

_Q_ _QU_ _QE_ 15 _P/_ 2 for _P <_ $24 (5.1)
= + =  
We can write this in the more normal inverse form as:


_P_ = 36 − 4 _Q_ for $36 ≥ _P_ ≥ $24

_P_ = 30 − 2 _Q_ for _P <_ $24 (5.2)


98 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


This demand relationship is illustrated in Figure 5.1. The kink in the aggregate demand
function at a price of $24 and a quantity of 3 million occurs because at any price above $24
books will be sold only in the United States whereas once the price drops below $24 both
markets are active. The marginal revenue function associated with this demand function
satisfies the usual “twice as steep” rule:


_MR_ = 36 − 8 _Q_ for _Q <_ 3

_MR_ = 30 − 4 _Q_ for _Q >_ 3 (5.3)


This is also illustrated in Figure 5.1. The jump in the marginal revenue function at a
quantity of 3 million arises because when price falls from just above $24 to just below $24,
the inactive European market becomes active. That is, when the price falls to just below
$24, it brings in a new set of consumers.

We can use equations (5.1)–(5.3) to calculate the profit maximizing price, aggregate
quantity, and quantity in each market. Equating marginal revenue with marginal cost,
assuming that both markets are active, we have 30 − 4 _Q_ = 4 so that _Q_ [∗] = 6.5 million.
From the aggregate demand curve (5.2) this gives a price of _P_ [∗] = $17. It follows from the
individual market demands (5.1) that 4.75 million books will be sold in the United States
and 1.75 million books in Europe. Aggregate profit (ignoring all the fixed and other set-up
costs) is _(_ 17 − 4 _)_ [∗] 6.5 = $84.5 million.

That this pricing strategy is not the best that the monopolist can adopt is actually clear
from Figure 5.1. At the equilibrium we have just calculated, the marginal revenue on
the last book sold in Europe is greater than marginal cost whereas marginal revenue on the
last book sold in the United States is less than marginal cost (it is actually negative in this
example!). Transferring some of the books sold in the United States to the European market
will, therefore, lead to an increase in profit.

**Figure 5.2** Third-degree price discrimination or group pricing—constant marginal cost
The firm sets output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost in each market and sets the market clearing
price in each market.


We can make this more explicit. A necessary condition for profit maximization under
third-degree price discrimination is that marginal revenue must equal marginal cost in _each_
market that the monopolist serves. If this were not the case in a particular market, then
the last unit sold in that market would be generating either more or less in cost than it
is earning in revenue. Cutting back or increasing total production in that market would
therefore raise profits. If marginal cost in serving each market is identical, as in our case,
then this condition implies that marginal revenue be the same on the last unit sold in each
market. If this condition does not hold, the monopolist can raise revenue and profit with no
increase in production (and hence, no increase in costs), simply by shifting sales from the
low marginal revenue market to the high one.

The application of these principles to our example is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Recall that
demand in the United States market is _PU_ 36 4 _QU_ _,_ and in Europe it is _PE_ 24 4 _QE_ .
This means that marginal revenue in the United States isis _MRE_ 24 8 _QE_ . Now apply the rule that marginal revenue equals marginal cost in = - _MRU_ = 36 − 8 _QU_ and in Europe = each market. This gives a profit-maximizing output in the United States of = - _Q_ [∗] [ 4 million]

set-up costs) of $89 million, an increase of $4.5 million over the nondiscriminatory profit.

How does this outcome relate to the elasticity rule that we presented above? An important
property of linear demand curves is that the elasticity of demand falls smoothly from infinity
to zero as we move down the demand curve. This means that, for any price less than $24
(and greater than zero) the elasticity of demand in the United States market is lower than in
the European market. (You can check this by evaluating the demand elasticity in the two
markets at any price for which both markets are active.) Our rule then states that we should
find a higher price in the United States than in Europe, precisely as in our example.

How is our analysis affected if marginal cost is not constant? The same basic principles
apply with one important change. If marginal production costs are not constant, we cannot

**Figure 5.3** Non-discriminatory pricing with non-constant marginal cost
The firm identifies aggregate demand and the associated marginal revenue. It chooses total output where
marginal revenue equals marginal cost and the non-discriminatory price from the aggregate demand function.
Output in each market is the market clearing output


treat the two markets independently. Whatever output the monopolist chooses to supply to
the United States, for example, affects the marginal cost of supplying Europe. As a result
we need to look at the different markets together. Nevertheless, we still have simple rules
that guide the monopolist’s pricing decisions in these markets.

To illustrate this point, suppose that the publisher of _Harry Potter and the Deathly_
_Hallows_ has a single printing facility that produces books for both the United States and
European markets and that marginal cost is given by _MC_ = 0.75 + _Q/_ 2, where _Q_ is the
total number of books printed.

Figure 5.3 illustrates the profit-maximizing behavior if the monopolist chooses not to
price discriminate. The basic analytical steps in this process are as follows:


1. Calculate aggregate market demand as above.
2. Identify the marginal revenue function for this aggregate demand function. From our
example, if _Q >_ 3 so that both markets are active, this is _MR_ = 30 − 4 _Q_ .
3. Equate marginal revenue with marginal cost to determine aggregate output. Thus we
have 0.75 + _Q/_ 2 = 30 − 4 _Q_ giving _Q_ [∗] = 6.5 million books.
4. Identify the equilibrium price from the aggregate demand function. Because both
markets are active, the relevant part of the aggregate demand function is _P_ = 30 − 2 _Q_,
giving an equilibrium price of _P_ [∗] = $17.
5. Calculate demand in each market at this price: 4.75 million books in the United States
and 1.75 million books in Europe.


Now suppose that the monopolist chooses to price discriminate. This outcome is illustrated
in Figure 5.4. The underlying process is clearly different, and the steps in implementing
profit maximizing price discrimination are as follows:


1. Derive marginal revenue in each market and add these _horizontally_ to give aggregate
marginal revenue. Marginal revenue in the United States is _MR_ = 36 − 8 _QU_ for any

$24. Inverting these gives _QU_ 4.5 _MR/_ 8 and _QE_ 3 _MR/_ 8. Summing these
gives an aggregate marginal revenue: =   - =

This can be inverted to give aggregate marginal revenue its more usual form


_MR_ = 36 − 8 _Q_ for _Q_ ≤ 1.5

_MR_ = 30 − 4 _Q_ for _Q >_ 1.5 (5.5)



Note how this step differs from the non-discriminatory case. In the latter both markets
are treated as one, so we start with aggregate demand and derive its associated marginal
revenue. In the discriminatory pricing case, by contrast, the markets are supplied
separately, with the profit maximizing condition that _MC_ = _MR_ in both markets so we
need aggregate marginal revenue, not aggregate demand.
2. Equate aggregate marginal revenue with marginal cost to identify the equilibrium
aggregate quantity _and_ marginal revenue. So we have 30 − 4 _Q_ = 0.75 + 2 _Q_ giving
_Q_ [∗] = 6.5. As a result, the equilibrium marginal revenue is $4, which is equal to the
marginal cost of the last unit produced.
3. Identify the equilibrium quantities in each market by equating individual market
marginal revenue with the equilibrium marginal revenue and marginal cost. In the
United States this gives 36 8 _QU_ 4 or _Q_ [∗] _U_

functions, giving a price of $20 in the United States and $14 in Europe.


102 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


The foregoing procedure is again derived from two simple rules that guide the monopolist’s pricing decisions with third-degree price discrimination. These rules apply no matter
the shape of the monopolist’s marginal cost function. The rules are:


1. Marginal revenue must be equal for the last unit sold in each market.
2. Marginal revenue must equal marginal cost, where marginal cost is measured at the
_aggregate_ output level.


There is one further interesting point that is worth noting regarding the contrast between
uniform pricing (no price discrimination) and third-degree price discrimination. When
demand is linear and both markets are active under both pricing schemes, _aggregate_
_demand is identical with the two pricing policies_ . This is proved formally in the chapter
Appendix. The intuition is simple to see. When both markets are active, aggregate marginal
revenue is identical with the two pricing policies (we are below the discontinuity in _MR_
in Figure 5.3). So equating aggregate marginal revenue with aggregate marginal cost must
give the same aggregate output. The reason that third-degree price discrimination is more
profitable in this case is that the aggregate output is allocated more profitably across
the two markets—to ensure that marginal revenue on the last unit sold in each market
is equal.

We complete our discussion of third-degree price discrimination in this section by making
explicit the relationship between the price set and the elasticity of demand in any specific
market segment. Our review of monopoly and market power in Chapters 2 and 3 explained
how we could express the firm’s marginal revenue in any market in terms of price and the
point elasticity of demand at that price. Specifically, marginal revenue in market _i_ is given

 - _η_ [1]







by _MRi_ _Pi_
=



_ηi_



where _ηi_ is (the absolute value of) the elasticity of demand. The



larger is _ηi_ the more elastic is demand in this market. Now recall that third-degree price
discrimination requires that the profit-maximizing aggregate output must be allocated such
that marginal revenue is equalized across each market (and, of course, equal to marginal
cost). For example, if there are two markets this says that� _MR_ - 1 = _MR_ 2. Substituting from�

can solve this for the ratio of the two prices to give:

From this, it is clear that price will indeed be lower in the market with the higher elasticity
of demand. The intuition is that prices must be lower in those markets in which consumers
are sensitive to price. Such price sensitivity means that raising the price will lose too many
customers, and this loss more than offsets any gain in surplus per customer. To put it
differently, when consumers are price sensitive, the strategy of lowering price can actually
raise the monopolist’s total surplus because it brings in many additional purchases. We
encourage you to reinterpret the various examples with which we motivated our analysis in
terms of demand elasticities. For example, is it reasonable to think that business travelers
will have a lower elasticity of demand for air travel at a particular time than vacation
travelers?


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing 103


movie is shown. Early moviegoers who go to films before 5 pm are more sensitive to price
than are evening moviegoers. With some market research, the manager discovers that the
_Q_ demand curves for daytime (D) and evening (E) moviegoers are _E_ 140 10 _PE_, respectively. The marginal cost of showing a movie is constant and _QD_ = 100 − 10 _PD_ and
equal to $3 per customer no matter when the movie is shown. This includes the costs of = ticketing and cleaning.


a. What is the profit maximizing pricing policy if the manager charges the same price
for daytime and evening attendance? What is attendance in each showing and what is
aggregate profit per day?
b. Now suppose that the manager adopts a third-degree price discrimination scheme,
setting a different day and evening price. What are the profit maximizing prices? What
is attendance at each session? Confirm that aggregate attendance is as in (a). What is
aggregate profit per day?


5.4 PRODUCT VARIETY AND THIRD-DEGREE PRICE
DISCRIMINATION OR GROUP PRICING


We have thus far defined price discrimination as occurring whenever a firm sells an identical
product to two or more buyers at different prices. But what if the products are not identical?
Ford, for example, offers several hundred (perhaps even several thousand) varieties of the
Ford _Taurus_ with slightly different features. Procter and Gamble offers a wide range of
toothpastes in different tastes, colors, and claimed medicinal qualities. Kellogg’s offers
dozens of breakfast cereals that vary in terms of grain, taste, consistency, and color.

Many examples of what looks like third-degree price discrimination or group pricing arise
when the seller offers such _differentiated_ products. For example, books are first released as
expensive hardcover editions and only later as cheap paperbacks. Hotels in a ski area are
more expensive in winter than in summer. First class air travel costs more than coach. The
common theme of these examples is that they all involve variations of a basic product. This
is a phenomenon that we meet every day in buying restaurant meals, refrigerators, electronic
goods, and many other goods and services. In each of these situations, what we observe is a
firm selling different varieties of the same good—distinguished by color, material, or design.
As a brief reflection on the typical restaurant menu will reveal, what we also usually observe
is that the different varieties are aimed at different groups and sold at different prices.

In considering these as applications of price discrimination we have to be careful. After
all, the cost incurred in producing goods of different types, such as hardback and paperback
books, or first class versus coach flights, is different. Philips (1983) provides perhaps
the best definition of third-degree price discrimination or group pricing once we allow
for product differentiation: “Price discrimination should be defined as implying that two
varieties of a commodity are sold (by the same seller) to two buyers at different _net_ prices,
the net price being the price (paid by the buyer) corrected for the cost associated with the
product differentiation.”




104 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Using this definition, it would not be discriminatory to charge $750 extra for a car with
antilock brakes if it costs $750 extra to assemble a car with such brakes. By contrast, the
difference in price between a coach class fare of $450 and a first class fare of $8,000
for service between Boston and London must be seen as almost entirely reflecting price
discrimination because the additional cost of providing first class service per passenger
is well below the $7,550 difference in price. In other words, price discrimination among
different versions of the same good exists only if the difference in prices is not justified by
differences in underlying costs: this is what Philips means by the _net price_ .

Consideration of product variety leads to a very important question. Does offering
different varieties of a product enhance the monopolist’s ability to charge different net
prices? That is, does a firm with market power increase its ability to price discriminate by
offering different versions of its product? As we shall see, the general answer is yes.

We can obtain at least some insight into this issue by recalling the two problems that
successful discrimination must overcome, namely, identification and arbitrage. In order
to price discriminate, the firm must determine who is who on its demand curve and then
be able to prevent resale between separate consumers. By offering different versions or
models of its product, the monopolist may be able to solve these two problems. Different
consumers may buy different versions of a good and therefore reveal who they are through
their purchase decisions. Moreover, because different customers are purchasing different
varieties, the problem of resale is considerably reduced.

As an example of the potential for product differentiation to enhance profit, consider an
airline that we will call Delta Airlines (DA), operating direct passenger flights between
Boston and Amsterdam. DA knows that there are three types of customers for these flights:
those who prefer to travel first class, those who wish to travel business class, and those who
are reconciled to having to travel coach. One part of the arbitrage problem is, of course,
easily solved: in order to sit in a first class seat you need a first class ticket. However, there
is another aspect to this problem. If the difference in price is great enough relative to the
value a consumer places on a higher class of travel, a business class traveler, for example,
might choose to fly coach. For simplicity, we assume that this arbitrage, or self-selection
problem does not arise. That is, we assume that first class passengers prefer not to travel
rather than sit in business or coach, and business class passengers similarly will not consider
coach travel—they place sufficiently high values on the differences in quality between the
types of seat that they will not trade down. (See end-of-chapter problem 5 for an example
of this case). [4]

DA’s market research indicates that daily demand for first class travel on this route
Coach travel isis _PF_ = 18,500 _P_ - _C_ 1,000 1500 _QF_ _,_ for business class travel is5 _QC_ . The marginal cost is estimated to be $100 for a coach _PB_ = 9,200 − 250 _QB_, and for
passenger, $200 for a business class passenger, and $500 for a first class passenger. = 
The profit maximizing third-degree price discrimination scheme for differentiated products of this type satisfies essentially the same rules as for homogeneous products. Simply
put, DA should identify the quantity that equates marginal revenue with marginal cost
for each class of seat and then identify the equilibrium price from the relevant demand
function. For first class passengers this requires _MRF_ 18,500 2,000 _QF_ 500, or
_Q_ [∗] [ 9. The resulting first class fare is] _[ P]_ [ $9,500. In business class, we have] = - =

different types of travelers are committed to particular classes of travel. Of course, this
may not always be the case. For example, the downturn in economic activity through 2011
has encouraged many businesses to seek ways to cut costs. In particular, business travelers
increasingly are required by their companies to fly coach. It remains the case that these
types of travelers are willing to pay more (though not as much more as before) for air
travel than casual or vacation travelers. Now, however, the airline’s ability to exploit the
difference in willingness to pay faces a potentially severe arbitrage problem.

To see this more clearly, let’s simplify the problem and suppose that the airline has
just two types of customers, business people and vacationers. Business people are known
to have a high reservation price, or willingness to pay, for a return ticket, which we will
denote as _V_ _[B]_ . Vacationers, by contrast, have a low reservation price, denoted as _V_ _[V]_ . By
assumption, _V_ _[B]_ _> V_ _[V]_, and the airline would obviously like to exploit this difference by
charging business customers a high price and vacationers a low one. However, the airline


106 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


cannot simply impose this distinction. A policy of explicitly charging business customers
more than vacationers would quickly lead to every customer claiming to be on holiday and
not on business. To be sure, the airline could try to identify which passengers really are on
holiday, but this would be costly and likely to alienate customers.

If this were the end of our story, it would appear that the airline has no choice but to
sell its tickets at a single, uniform price. It would then face the usual textbook monopoly
dilemma. A high price will earn a large surplus from every customer that buys a ticket but
clearly leads to a smaller, mostly business set of passengers. By contrast, a low price will
encourage many more people to fly but, unfortunately, leave the company with little surplus
from any one consumer.

Suppose, however, that business and holiday travelers differ in another respect as well as
in their motives for flying. To be specific, suppose that business travelers want to complete
their trip and return home within three days, whereas vacationers want to be away for at least
one week. Suppose also that the airline learns (through surveys and other market research)
that business travelers are willing to pay a premium beyond a normal ticket price if they
can be guaranteed a return flight within their preferred three-day span. In this case, product
differentiation by means of offering two differentiated tickets—one with a minimum time
away of a week and another with no minimum stay—will enable the airline to extract
considerable surplus from each type of consumer.

The complete strategy would be as follows: First, set a low price of _V_ _[V]_ for tickets
requiring a minimum of one week before returning. Because holiday travelers do not mind
staying away seven days, and because the ticket price does not exceed their reservation
price, they will willingly purchase this ticket. Because such travelers are paying their
reservation price, the airline has extracted their entire consumer surplus and converted it
into profit for itself. [5]

Second, the airline should set a price as close to _V_ _[B]_ as possible for flights with no
minimum stay. The limit on its ability to do this will be such factors as the cost of paying
for a hotel for extra nights, the price of alternative transportation capable of returning
individuals in three days, and related considerations. Denote the dollar value of these other
factors as _M_ . Business people wanting to return quickly will gladly pay a premium over the
one week price _V_ _[V]_ up to the value of _M_, so long as their total fare is less than _V_ _[B]_ . (The
precise condition is _V_ _[V]_ + _M < V_ _[B]_ .) Using such a scheme enables the airline to extract
considerable surplus from business customers, while simultaneously extracting the entire
surplus from vacationers.

In short, even if the airline cannot squeeze out the entire consumer surplus from the
market, it can nevertheless improve its profits greatly by offering two kinds of tickets. This
is undoubtedly the reason that the practice just described is so common among airlines and
other transportation companies. (See Reality Checkpoint.) Such companies offer different
varieties of their product as a means of having their customers self-select into different
groups. Automobile and appliance manufacturers us a similar strategy—offering different
product lines meant to appeal to consumers of different incomes or otherwise different
willingness to pay. Stiglitz (1977) labels such mechanisms as _screening devices_ because


5 An alternative and frequently used distinction is to require that the traveler stay over a Saturday night
in order to qualify for a cheap fare. Presumably a corporation will not want to finance the lodgings of
its employees when they are not on company business. Further, business travelers will typically want to
spend weekends with family and loved ones. On both counts, the Saturday night requirement works as a
self-separating device.

they screen or separate customers precisely along the relevant dimension of willingness to
pay.

A rather curious kind of screening is illustrated by Wolfram Research, manufacturers of
the _Mathematica_ [R] software package. In making its student version of the software, Wolfram
disables a number of functions that are available in the full academic or commercial versions.
In 2011, Wolfram offered the full version of _Mathematica_ [R] at around $2,495, the academic
version at around $1,095, and the student version at around $140. There is little doubt that
this is a case involving substantial differences in net prices.

The motivation behind this screening by means of product differentiation seems equally
clear. Wolfram realizes that some customers do not need—or at least do not want to pay
very much for—the full version of their software. Wolfram markets the low-priced version
of _Mathematica_ [R] for these consumers, and then sells the extended version to customers
with a high willingness to pay for the improved product. Note that the two products must
really differ in some important respect (to consumers at least). If Wolfram did not reduce


108 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


the capabilities of the student version, it would have to worry about arbitrage between the
two customer groups, with students buying for their professors!

The Wolfram example just described is a type of screening referred to by marketing
experts as “crimping the product.” Deneckere and McAffee (1996) argue that crimping,
or deliberately damaging a product to enhance the ability to price discriminate, has been
a frequent practice of manufacturers throughout history. Among the examples that they
cite are (1) IBM’s _Laser Printer E_, an intentionally slower version of the company’s
higher-priced top-of-the-line laser printer and (2) simple cooking wine, which is ordinary
table wine with so much salt added that it is undrinkable. Some people have even argued
that the US Post Office deliberately reduces the quality of its standard, first class service so
as to raise demand for its two-day priority and overnight mail services.

Each of these examples is a clear case of a difference in net prices. The lower-quality
product sells for a lower price, yet—because it starts as a high-quality product and then
requires the further cost of crimping—the lower-quality product is actually more expensive
to make. Why do firms crimp a high-quality product to produce a low-quality one instead
of simply producing a low-quality one in the first place? The most obvious answer relates
to costs of production. Given that a firm with monopoly power such as Wolfram knows that
there are consumers of different types willing to buy different varieties of its product, the
firm must decide how these consumer types can be supplied with products “close” to those
that they most want at least cost. It may well be cheaper to produce the student version of
_Mathematica_ [R] by crimping the full version rather than to set up a separate production line
dedicated to manufacturing different versions of the software package.

The final type of product differentiation that we consider in this chapter is differentiation
by _location of sale_ . [6] In many cases, a product for sale in one location is not the same as
the otherwise identical product for sale in another location. A prescription drug such as
_Lipitor_ [R] for sale in Wisconsin is not identical to the same prescription drug for sale in New
York state. Even with the advent of sophisticated Internet search engines, a new automobile
for sale in one state is not identical to the same new automobile for sale in another state.

To illustrate why this type of product differentiation can lead to price discrimination,
suppose that there is a company, Boston Sea Foods (BSF), which sells a proprietary brand
of clam chowder. BSF knows that demand for its chowder in Boston is _PB_ _A_ _BQB_
and in Manhattan is _PM_ _A_ _BQM_, where quantities are measured in thousands of pints. = In other words, the firm believes that these two markets have identical demands. BSF has = constant marginal costs of _c_ per thousand pints of chowder. Transport costs to reach the
Boston market are negligible but it costs BSF an amount _t_ to transport a thousand pints of
chowder to Manhattan.

How does BSF maximize its profits from these two markets, given that BSF employs
linear pricing? BSF should apply the rules that we have already developed. It should equate
marginal revenue with marginal cost in each market. In the Boston market this requires that

discrimination, any difference in price should be equal to the difference in the costs of

product differentiation. In our BSF example, it costs BSF _t_ per thousand pints to send
chowder from Boston to Manhattan but the difference in price in the two markets is only
_t/_ 2. In other words, BSF is price discriminating by absorbing 50 percent of the transport
costs of sending its chowder to Manhattan.

What about the arbitrage problem in the BSF example? Manhattanites might want to buy
their chowder directly in the Boston market, but it is economic for them to do so only if they
have access to a transport technology that is at least 50 percent cheaper than that employed
by BSF, a very tall order other than for those who choose to vacation in Boston.

Returning to our prescription drug example in Table 5.1, one possible explanation for
the difference in prices in the three United States regions might be differences in costs of
supplying these three regions. Another, of course, would be differences in demands in the
three regions arising from differences in these regions’ demographics or incomes.


Washington. NS has estimated that the demands in these three markets are respectively
_QB_ 10,000 1,000 _PB_, _QNY_ 20,000 2,000 _PNY_ and _QW_ 15,000 1,500 _PW_,
where quantities are pints of clam chowder per day. The marginal cost of making a pint = - = - = of clam chowder in their Boston facility is $1. In addition, it costs $1 per pint to ship the
chowder to New York and $2 per pint to ship to Washington.


a. What are the profit maximizing prices that NS should set in these three markets? How
much chowder is sold per day in each market?
b. What profit does NS make in each market?


5.5 THIRD-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION OR GROUP
PRICING AND SOCIAL WELFARE


The term “price discrimination” suggests inequity and, from a social perspective, sounds
like a “bad thing.” Is it? To answer this question, we must recall the economist’s approach
to social welfare and the problem raised by the standard monopoly model. Economists view
arrangements as less than socially optimal whenever there are potential trades that could
make both parties better off. This is the reason that a standard monopoly is sub-optimal. The
textbook monopolist practicing uniform pricing restricts output. At the margin, consumers
value the product _more_ than it costs the monopolist to produce it. A potentially mutually
beneficial trade exists but under uniform pricing such a trade will not occur.

The question that we consider in this section is whether third-degree price discrimination
worsens or reduces this monopoly distortion. The intuitive reason that third-degree discrimination may reduce efficiency relative to the uniform pricing case is essentially that such
a policy amounts to uniform pricing within two or more separate markets. It thus runs the
risks of compounding the output-reducing effects of monopoly power.

We can be more specific regarding the welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination
by drawing on the work of Schmalensee (1981). This is illustrated for the case of two

and the nondiscriminatory output in the weak and the strong market. It follows, of course,
that _�Q_ 1 _>_ 0 and _�Q_ 2 _<_ 0.

Our normal definition of welfare is the sum of consumer plus producer surplus. Using
this definition, an upper limit on the increase in surplus that follows from third-degree price
discrimination in Figure 5.5 is the area G minus the area L. This gives us the following
equation. (In writing equation (5.7) we have used the property that _�Q_ 2 _<_ 0.)

other words, a necessary condition for third-degree price discrimination to increase welfare=
is that it increases total output.

We know from the Harry Potter example (and from the more general presentation in the
Appendix) that when demands in the various markets are linear, total output is identical
with discriminatory and non-discriminatory pricing. It follows that with linear demands


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing 111


third-degree price discrimination must reduce total welfare. The increase in profit is more
than offset by the reduction in consumer surplus. Schmalensee states:


“If one thinks that demand curves are about as likely to be concave as convex _. . ._ (this) _. . ._
might lead one to the conclusion that monopolistic third-degree price discrimination should be
outlawed.” (Schmalensee 1981, 246) See also Shih, Mai and Lui (1988).


However, before jumping to the suggested conclusion, we need to note an important
caveat. Our analysis implicitly assumes that the same markets are served with and without
price discrimination. This may very well not be the case. In particular, one property of
price discrimination that we have not yet considered is that it can make it profitable to serve
markets that will not be served with non-discriminatory prices. If this is the case, then the
additional welfare from the new markets that third-degree price discrimination introduces
more than offsets any loss of welfare in the markets that were previously being served.

A simple example serves to make this point. Suppose that monthly demand for a patented
islower demand because their income is so much smaller. Further assume that the marginalAIDS drug treatment in North America is _PS_ = _α_ 100 − _QS_ with _α <_ 1 reflecting the assumption that African consumers have a _PN_ = 100 − _QN_ and in Sub-Saharan Africa
cost of producing each month’s treatment is constant at _c_ = 20 per unit and that transport
costs to the African market are negligible.

Now assume that the patent holder is constrained from price discriminating across the two
markets. As before, we start by inverting the demand functions to give _QN_ 100 _P_ and
_QS_ _α_ 100 _P_ . If the price is low enough to attract buyers in both markets then aggregate = demand is: = _Q_ - = _(_ 1 + _α)_ 100 − 2 _P_ or _P_ = _(_ 1 + _α)_ 50 − _Q/_ 2, and marginal revenue is
_MR_ = _(_ 1 + _α)_ 50 − _Q_ . Equating marginal revenue with marginal cost _c_ = 20, gives the
equilibrium output, _Q_ = _(_ 1 + _α)_ 50 − 20 = 30 + _α_ 50, and price _P_ = 35 + 25 _α_ .

Now recall our assumption that both markets are active without price discrimination. For
this assumption to hold it must be that the equilibrium price when there is no discrimination
is less than the maximum price— _α_ 100—that Sub-Saharan African consumers are willing
and able to pay. That is, for our assumption to hold it must be the case that 35 + 25 _α < α_ 100.
In turn, this implies that for both markets to be active with no price discrimination it is
necessary that _α >_ 35 _/_ 75 _or α >_ 0.466. In other words, for the Sub-Saharan African market
to be served it is necessary that the maximum willingness to pay for AIDS drugs in that
market be at least 47 percent of the maximum willingness to pay in North America.

Moreover, even if _α >_ 0.466, the Sub-Saharan African market may not be served. From
the patent-holding firm’s perspective, it is not quite enough that the maximum willingness
to pay exceeds the price charged _if_ it serves both markets. This is because the monopolist
always has the option of choosing a higher price and serving only the North American
market. In the end-of-chapter problem 6, you are asked to show that _α >_ 0.531 for it to be
profitable for the firm to serve both markets when price discrimination is for some reason
prohibited.

Why might allowing the firm to price discriminate in this example lead to an increase
in total welfare? Whether or not the monopolist is allowed to price discriminate, the firm
will set the monopoly price in the United States so there is no change on total surplus in
the United States. What about the Sub-Saharan market? For the monopolist to be willing to
supply this market all that is needed now is that the reservation price 100 _α_ be greater than
marginal cost of $20, or _α >_ 0.2. If this condition is satisfied, total surplus is increased by

be served.


natory pricing than with third-degree price discrimination.


5.6 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: PRICE DISCRIMINATION IN THE
NEW CAR MARKET


As we have seen, a firm with market power has a very strong interest in discriminating in
the price it charges to different consumers—getting the most from those with the greatest
willingness to pay and concluding a sale to those with lower valuations of the good at
a lower price. As we have seen, an explicit pricing rule such as time-of-day pricing can
sometimes be used to this effect. However, in a number of cases, the actual price paid is not
the result of an explicit pricing schedule but, instead, reflects the outcome of a bargaining
process between seller and buyer. New car purchases are a good example.

Automobiles come with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) but the actual
price paid by any consumer is typically the outcome of a bargaining process between the
buyer and the car dealer. As a result, different consumers will end up paying different
prices. In part, this will depend on factors that affect the dealer’s willingness to reduce
price, such as an end-of-the-month sales bonus or the number of rival dealerships nearby.
Controlling for these factors, however, variations in the price paid should reflect variations
in consumer demand elasticity. Consumers with incomes well above the average are likely
to pay more while consumers who are well-informed about car prices at other dealers, i.e.,
those with low search costs, will be more price sensitive and negotiate a lower price. There
may also be overt discrimination based on other factors such as gender and race.

Scott Morton, Zettelmeyer, and Silva-Risso (2003) (hereafter SZS) examine actual new
car prices for over 671,000 transactions at over 3,500 dealers during a 14 month period
beginning on January 1, 1999 and ending on February 28, 2000. Working with a market
research firm, the authors were able to collect data for each of these transactions regarding
the price paid, the make, model, and trim level of the car, the financing and any trade-in
values that accompanied the deal, the dealership that made the sale, the name, address,
and age of the buyer and, very importantly, whether the buyer used the online car-referral
service, Autobytel.

SZS can match the name and address of each buyer to a specific census block group,
which is a precise neighborhood of 1,100 people that comprises about one-fourth of the
geographic tracts compiled by the US Census Bureau. For each such census block, the
authors have data on the percentage of the population that is black, Hispanic, and Asian (and
hence, the percentage that is in none of these racial groups). They also have data on other
socioeconomic variables for the block such as median household income, the percentage that
own their homes, the percentage that completed college, and the occupational breakdown
between professionals, business executives, blue collar workers, and technicians.

SZS then identify 834 specific “cars” depending on the make, model, and trim involved.
For each such car, they measure the net price paid by the buyer as the transaction price less


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing 113


any manufacturer’s rebate and also less any excess value given for a trade-in as measured
by the difference between the value assigned the trade-in vehicle and that car’s book value.
Because they cannot control for all option features, they include a variable that should
indicate additional special features called DVehCost. This is measured as the difference
between the vehicle’s recorded invoice (dealer cost) and the average cost for that type
of car. As noted, SZS also control for the number of nearby rival dealers, the “hotness”
of the car (how long since it was first introduced), end-of-month sales, and various other
dealer characteristics. The first of the main results of the SZS research for our purposes
are shown in Table 5.3. For ease of interpretation, all coefficient estimates have been
multiplied by 100.

Because the dependent variable is the natural log of the net purchase price, the coefficients
are naturally interpreted as percentage price effects. In this light, first note that the dealer
control variables generally have the right sign and are statistically significant. For example,
the inclusion of unobserved features that raise the vehicle cost above the dealer’s average
also raise the final price, as does the presence of a trade-in as dealers try to recover some
of the trade-in value paid. Competition as measured by the number of rival dealers nearby
significantly lowers the price.
