**Summary**



Industrial organization is the study of imperfect
competition. Industrial economists are interested
in markets that we actually encounter in the real
world. However, these real world markets come
in many shapes and flavors. For example, some
are comprised of a few large firms; some have
one large firm and many smaller ones. In some,
the products are greatly differentiated while in
others they are nearly identical. Some firms compete largely by trying to keep prices as low as
possible. In other markets, advertising and other
forms of non-price competition are the dominant
tactics. This range of possibilities has meant that
over time, industrial organization has become a
field rich with practical insights regarding real
business behavior and public policy. This book
is all about these developments.

Firms in imperfectly competitive industries
need to make strategic decisions—that is, decisions that will have an identifiable impact on other
participants in the market, be they rival firms,
suppliers, or distributors. As a result, making any
such choice must inevitably involve some consideration of how these other players in the game
will react. Examples of such strategic choice variables include price, product design, decisions to



expand capacity, and whether or not to invest
heavily in research and development of a new
product. This book presents the modern analysis of market situations involving such strategic
interaction—an analysis that is rooted in noncooperative game theory. We use this analysis to
examine such issues as why there are so many
varieties of cereals, or how firms maintain a pricefixing agreement, or how advertising and product
innovation affect the nature of competition. We
also describe how the predictions of these models
have been tested.

Our interest is more than just determining the
profit-maximizing strategies that firms in a particular market context should adopt. As economists
we are interested in the market outcomes that
result when firms adopt such strategies, and
whether those outcomes are close to those of
the competitive ideal. If not, we then need to ask
whether and how public policy can improve market allocations. Our hope is to convey the value
of economic research and the gains from learning
“to think like an economist.” More generally, we
hope to demonstrate the vitality and relevance
of industrial organization, both in theory and in
practice.

Sec. 2.


_(a) Price; selection of customers_


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce,
either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of
commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved
in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use,
consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of
Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States,
and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition
or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such
discrimination, or with customers of either of them: Provided, That nothing herein contained
shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of
manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which
such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered: Provided, however, That the
Federal Trade Commission may, after due investigation and hearing to all interested parties,
fix and establish quantity limits, and revise the same as it finds necessary, as to particular
commodities or classes of commodities, where it finds that available purchasers in greater
quantities are so few as to render differentials on account thereof unjustly discriminatory
or promotive of monopoly in any line of commerce; and the foregoing shall then not be
construed to permit differentials based on differences in quantities greater than those so
fixed and established: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent

persons engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise in commerce from selecting their
own customers in bona fide transactions and not in restraint of trade: And provided further,
That nothing herein contained shall prevent price changes from time to time where in
response to changing conditions affecting the market for or the marketability of the goods
concerned, such as but not limited to actual or imminent deterioration of perishable goods,
obsolescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under court process, or sales in good faith in
discontinuance of business in the goods concerned.


_(b) Burden of rebutting prima-facie case of discrimination_


Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has
been discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting
the prima-facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person charged
with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown,
the Commission is authorized to issue an order terminating the discrimination: Provided,
however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie
case thus made by showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities
to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a
competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor.


_(c) Payment or acceptance of commission, brokerage, or other compensation_


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce,
to pay or grant, or to receive or accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage,
or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, except for services
rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either
to the other party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary
therein where such intermediary is acting in fact for or in behalf, or is subject to the direct
or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the person by whom such
compensation is so granted or paid.


_(d) Payment for services or facilities for processing or sale_


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment
of anything of value to or for the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such
commerce as compensation or in consideration for any services or facilities furnished by
or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for
sale of any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person,
unless such payment or consideration is available on proportionally equal terms to all other
customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities.


_(e) Furnishing services or facilities for processing, handling, etc._


It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another
purchaser or purchasers of a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by
contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the furnishing of, any services
or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of such
commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal
terms.

_(f) Knowingly inducing or receiving discriminatory price_


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce,
to be a party to, or assist in, any transaction of sale, or contract to sell, which discriminates to
his knowledge against competitors of the purchaser, in that, any discount, rebate, allowance,
or advertising service charge is granted to the purchaser over and above any discount, rebate,
allowance, or advertising service charge available at the time of such transaction to said
competitors in respect of a sale of goods of like grade, quality, and quantity; to sell, or
contract to sell, goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than those exacted
by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or
eliminating a competitor in such part of the United States; or, to sell, or contract to sell,
goods at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition or eliminating
a competitor.

_Sale, etc., on agreement not to use goods of competitor_


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce,
to lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery,
supplies, or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption, or
resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or
any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or fix a
price charged therefore, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition,
agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the
goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodity of a competitor or
competitors of the lessor seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or
such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or
tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.


Sec. 7.


No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire,
directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no
person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole
or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity
affecting commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce
in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen
competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.


# **2** **Basic Microeconomics**

Considerable time passed before Adam Smith’s original and intuitive insights regarding
the nature of market behavior and market outcomes were translated into formal models. It
then took even more time for that formal understanding to make its way into a standard
professional literature. Yet by the late nineteenth century, a rigorous understanding of the
benefits of competition versus monopoly had been established as evidenced in particular
by the publication of Alfred Marshall’s _**Principles of Economics, Vol. 1**_ (1890). While
we are ultimately interested in modeling the gray area that lies between competition and
monopoly, a sound understanding of the perfectly competitive and pure monopolized
markets is nevertheless quite insightful. Indeed, these models continue to provide useful
starting points for interpreting much of what one reads about in the daily business press.
They also reveal the primary intellectual force behind public policies designed to limit
monopoly power. For all these reasons, we undertake in this chapter a brief review of the
basic models of perfect competition and monopoly.


2.1 COMPETITION VERSUS MONOPOLY: THE POLES OF
MARKET PERFORMANCE


We focus on firm profit-maximizing behavior and the resultant market outcome that such
behavior implies. We take as given the derivation of an aggregate consumer demand for
the product that defines the market of interest. This market demand curve describes the
relationship between how much money consumers are willing to pay per unit of the good
and the aggregate quantity of the good consumed. Figure 2.1 shows an example of a market
demand curve—more specifically, a linear market demand curve that can be described by
the equation _P_ = _A_ - _BQ_ . When we write the demand curve in this fashion with price on
the left-hand side, it is often called an inverse demand curve. [1] The vertical intercept _A_ is


1 The reason for this terminology is that traditionally in microeconomics, we think of quantity demanded
as being the dependent variable, (left-hand side of the equation) and price, the independent variable,
(right-hand side of the equation). However, when firms choose quantities and price adjusts to clear the
market, it is preferable to put market price on the left-hand side, hence, the inverse demand function. Our
discussion should make clear that the market demand curve can be thought of as the horizontal summation
of the individual demand curve of each consumer. It is not, however, the horizontal summation of the
demand curve facing each firm.

the maximum willingness to pay, or maximum reservation demand price that any consumer
is willing to pay to have this good. At a market price greater than _A_, no one in this market
wants to buy any of the product. As the market price falls below _A_, demand for the product
increases. For example, if the market price of the good is _P_ 1, then consumers will desire to
purchase a quantity _Q_ 1 of the good. Alternatively, we may view _P_ 1 as consumer willingness
to pay at the margin. That is, _P_ 1 is the most any consumer would pay for the last or the
_Q_ 1th unit of the good.

When we draw a demand curve, we are implicitly thinking of some period of time over
which the good is consumed. For example, we may want to look at consumer demand
for the product per week, per quarter, or per year. Similarly, when we talk about firms
producing the good, we want to consider their corresponding weekly, quarterly, or annual
production of the good. The temporal period over which we define consumer demand and
firm production typically affects what production technologies are available to the firm
for producing the good. The shorter the time period, the fewer options any firm has for
altering its production. Following the tradition in microeconomics, we distinguish between
two general time periods: the short run and the long run. The short run is a sufficiently
short time period for the industry so that no new production facilities—no new plant and
equipment—can be brought on line. In the short run, neither the number of firms nor the
fixed capital at each firm can be changed. By contrast, the long run is a production period
sufficiently long so that firms can build new production facilities to meet market demand.

For either the short-run or the long-run scenario, we are interested in determining when
a market is in equilibrium. By this we mean finding an outcome at which the market is “at
rest.” A useful interpretation of a market equilibrium is a situation in which no consumer
and no firm in the market has an incentive to change its decision on how much to buy or
how much to sell. To be sure, the precise meaning of this definition may vary depending on
whether we consider the short run or the long run. Yet in either case, the essential feature
is the same. Equilibrium requires that no one has an incentive to change his or her trading
decision.


Basic Microeconomics 21


2.1.1 Perfect Competition


A perfectly competitive firm is a “price taker.” The price of its product is not something that
the perfectly competitive firm chooses. Instead, that price is determined by the interaction
of all the firms and consumers in the market for this good, and it is beyond the influence of
any one of the perfectly competitive firms. This characterization only makes sense if each
firm’s potential supply of the product is “small” relative to market demand for the product.
If a firm’s supply of a good were large relative to the market, we would expect that that firm
could influence the price at which the good was sold. An example of a “small” firm would
be a wheat farmer in Kansas or, alternatively, a broker on the New York Stock Exchange
trading IBM stock. Each is so small that any feasible change in their behavior leaves the
prices of wheat and IBM stock, respectively, unchanged.

Because a perfectly competitive firm cannot influence the market price at which the good
trades, the firm perceives that it can sell as much, or as little, as it wants to at that price. If
the firm cannot sell as much as it wants to at the market price, then the implication is that
selling more would require a fall in the price. Because this would imply that the firm has
some power over the market price, such a firm would not be a perfect competitor. The fact
that the firm cannot affect the market price also means that its actions do not affect other
producers. In turn, this means that perfectly competitive firms do not strategically interact
with any of their numerous rivals.

Because the output decision of a perfectly competitive firm does not affect the going
price, a graph of the inverse demand curve facing such a firm appears as a horizontal
line at the current market price. No matter how much or how little the firm produces, that
price remains unchanged. Note that this is the case even though the market demand curve
describing the demand faced by the entire industry is downward-sloping. [2] That market
demand curve indicates that if the aggregate output of all firms increases in any material
way, the market price will fall. Again, though, the distinguishing feature of a perfectly
competitive firm is that it is so small that its output choice has no such material impact on
total industry output—or where the industry is on the market demand curve.

Like all firms, the perfectly competitive ones will each choose that output level which
maximizes their individual profit. Profit is defined as the difference between the firm’s
revenue and its total costs. Revenue is just market price, _P_, times the firm’s output, _q_ .
The firm’s total cost is assumed to rise with the level of the firm’s production according
to some function, _C(q)_ . It is important to understand that the firm’s costs include the
amount necessary to pay the owners of the firm’s capital (that is, its stockholders) a normal
or competitive return. This is a way of saying that input costs are properly measured as
opportunity costs. That is, each input must be paid at least what that input could earn in its
next best alternative employment. This is true for the capital employed by the firm as much
as it is true for the labor and raw materials that the firm also uses. Generally speaking, the
opportunity cost for the firm’s capital is measured as the rate of return that the capital could
earn if invested in other industries. This cost is then included in our measure of total cost,
_C(q)_ . In other words, the concept of profit we are using is that of economic profit. It reflects
net revenue above what is necessary to pay all of the firm’s inputs at least what they could


2 This follows from the definition of a perfect competitor. One may wonder how each firm can face a
horizontal demand curve while industry demand is downward sloped. The answer is that the demand curve
facing the industry reflects the summation of the individual demand presented by each consumer—not the
individual demand facing each firm.


22 Foundations


earn in alternative employment. This point is important because it makes clear that when a
firm earns no economic profit it does not mean that its stockholders go away empty-handed.
It simply means that those stockholders do not earn more than a normal return on their
investment.

A necessary first order condition for profit maximization is that the firm chooses an output
level such that the revenue received for the last unit produced, or the marginal revenue, just
equals the cost incurred to produce that last unit, or the marginal cost. This condition for
profit maximization holds for the output choice of any firm, be it a perfectly competitive
one, or a monopoly. Since total revenue depends on the amount produced, marginal revenue
is also dependent on _q_ as described by the marginal revenue function, _MR(q)_ . Because
the perfectly competitive firm can sell as much as it likes at the going market price, each
additional unit of output produced and sold generates additional revenue exactly equal to
the current market price. That is, the marginal revenue function for a competitive firm is
just _MR(q)_ = _P_ . Similarly, because total cost is a function of total output, _q_, the marginal
cost function also depends on _q_, according to the function _MC(q)_ . This function describes
the additional cost incurred by the firm for each successive unit of output produced.

Diagrams like those shown in Figures 2.2(a) and 2.2(b), respectively, are often used to
illustrate the standard textbook model of the perfectly competitive firm and the perfectly
competitive market in which the firm sells. For any market to be in equilibrium, the
necessary condition mentioned earlier must hold for each firm. For a competitive market,
this means that for each firm the price received for a unit of output exactly equals the
cost of producing that output at the margin. This condition is illustrated in Figures 2.2(a)
and 2.2(b). The initial industry demand curve is _D_ 1 and the market price is _PC_ . A firm
producing output _qC_ incurs a marginal cost of production _MC(qC)_ just equal to that price.
Producing one more unit would incur an extra cost, as indicated by the marginal cost curve
_MC_ that exceeds the price at which that unit would sell. Conversely, producing less than _qC_
would save less in cost than it would sacrifice in revenue. When the firm produces _qC_ and
sells it at market price, _PC_, it is maximizing profit. It therefore has no incentive to change
its choice of output. Hence, in a competitive equilibrium each firm must produce at a point
where its marginal cost is just equal to the price.

Total market supply, _QC_, is the sum of each firm’s output, _qC_ . Because each firm is
maximizing profit, the condition _P_ _MC(qC)_, will hold for each firm. If demand for the
=
product increases and the market price rises to say _P_ 1, each firm will revise its production
decision and increase output to _q_ 1, where _P_ 1 _MC(q_ 1 _)_ . This will increase total production
to _Q_ 1. Indeed, because the firms’ production decisions are governed by costs at the margin, =
the marginal cost curve of each firm provides the basis for determining the total industry
supply at any given market price. As the price rises, we work out how each firm adjusts
its profit-maximizing output by moving up its marginal cost function to a point where
_P_ = _MC(q)_ at this new price. Then we add up all the firms’ revised decisions and compute
the total output now supplied. Repeating this exercise for various prices reveals the industry
supply function indicating the total output supplied at any given market price. It is illustrated
by the curve _S_ 1 in Figure 2.2(b). Because for each firm price is equal to its marginal cost,
it must be the case that at each point on the supply function for every firm the incremental
cost of the last unit produced is just equal to that price.

Consider a simple linear example where each firm’s marginal cost curve is linear instead
of curved, as shown in Figure 2.2(a). Specifically, let the marginal cost of each firm be:
_MC(q)_ = 4 _q_ + 8. Given a market price _P_, the optimal output for any one competitive firm

**Figure 2.2** The long-run competitive equilibrium
Price _P_ 1 is consistent with a short-run equilibrium in which each firm produces at a point where its marginal cost
is equal to _P_ 1. However, at _P_ 1 price exceeds average cost and each firm earns a positive economic profit. This
will encourage entry by new firms, shifting out the supply curve as shown in (b). The long-run competitive
equilibrium occurs at price _PC_, in which each firm produces output level _qC_ and price equals both average and
marginal cost.



is then _q_ such that 4 _q_ + 8 = _P_, implying that the optimal output for each such firm satisfies

_[P]_



_q_ _[P]_
= 4



_q_
= 4

If there are 80 such firms, total industry production [−] [2.] _Q_ at price _P_ is 80 times _q_ or
_Q_ _[S]_ = 20 _P_ - 160. Solving for _P_ writes the resultant supply curve in the form implied
by Figures 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) in which price appears on the vertical axis. This yields
_P_ = 0.05 _Q_ _[S]_ + 8. At a price of 8 or less, each firm will produce zero output. Industry
output will also be zero. A rise in _P_ to 12 will induce each firm to raise its output to
1 unit, increasing industry output to 80. A further rise to _P_ = 16 will lead every firm
to raise its output to 2 units, implying a total supply of 160. We could repeat this exercise
many times over, each time choosing a different price. Plotting the industry output against
each such price yields the industry supply curve. The important point to understand is that
the derivation of that supply curve reflects the underlying first order condition for profit
maximization—that is, each competitive firm choose a profit-maximizing level of output
such that _P_ = _MC(q)_ .

In the example shown in Figures 2.2(a) and 2.2(b), the market initially clears at the
price, _PC_ . Given the demand curve _D_ 1, this equilibrium is consistent with the first order
condition that each firm produce an output such that _P_ = _MC(q)_ . The requirement that
each firm produces where marginal cost equals the market price is almost all that is required
for a competitive equilibrium in the short run. [3] However, there is an additional condition
that must be met in order for this to be a long-run competitive equilibrium. The condition is
that in a long-run equilibrium, each firm earns zero economic profit. This condition is also
met in the initial equilibrium illustrated in Figure 2.2(a).



3 We say almost because there may be a distinction between average variable cost and marginal cost. No
production will occur at all in the short run if the firm cannot produce at a level that will cover its average
variable cost.


24 Foundations



At output _qC_, each firm is just covering its cost of production, including the cost of hiring
capital as well as labor and other inputs. In other words, a long-run competitive equilibrium
requires that firms just “break even” and not earn any economic profit—revenue in excess
of the amount required to attract the productive inputs into the industry. This requirement
can be stated differently. In the long run, the price of the good must just equal the average
or per unit cost of producing the good. Again, both this zero-profit condition and the further
requirement that price equal marginal cost are satisfied in the initial equilibrium in which
the industry demand curve is _D_ 1 and the price is _PC_ .

If demand suddenly shifts to the level described by the demand curve, _D_ 2, the existing
industry firms will respond by increasing output. In so doing, these firms maximize profit
by again satisfying the basic requirement that they each produce where _P_ = _MC(q)_ . This
leads each firm to expand its production from _qC_ to _q_ 1, thereby raising the market output
to _Q_ 1. However, this short-run response does not satisfy the zero profit condition required
for a long-run competitive equilibrium. At price _P_ 1, the market price equals each firm’s
marginal cost but exceeds each firm’s average cost. Hence, each firm earns a positive
economic profit ofSuch profit either induces new firms to enter the industry or existing firms to expand _P_ 1 − _AC(q_ 1 _)_ on each of the _q_ 1 units it sells.

production. This expansion shifts the industry supply curve outward until the equilibrium
price again just covers average cost. Figure 2.2(b) illustrates this by the shift in the industry
supply curve to _S_ 2. As drawn, this shift reestablishes the initial price, _PC_ . Each firm again
produces output _qC_ at which the industry price equals both the firm’s marginal cost and
its average cost. Of course, total industry output is now higher at _Q_ [′] _C_ [. While each firm]

is producing the output _qC_, there are now more firms. These examples illustrate a central
element in our definition of an equilibrium—namely, that no firm has the incentive to
change its production plan. In the long run, this includes the idea that no firm wishes either
to leave or to enter the market.

2.1.2 Monopoly


In a perfectly competitive market, each firm’s production of the good is tiny relative to the
market total. What would happen, though, if all of these tiny sellers become consolidated
into one firm, i.e., what would happen if the market were monopolized? Because this

**Figure 2.3** The marginal revenue from increased production for a monopolist
An increase in production from _Q_ 1 to _Q_ 2 causes a gain in revenues approximated by area _G_, and a loss in
revenues approximated by area _L_ . The net change or marginal revenue is therefore _G_ - _L_ . Note, because the
firm is a monopolist, this is also the net revenue gain generated by cutting the price from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2.


single firm would be the only supplier of the good, its demand curve is identical with the
market demand curve. In complete contrast to the competitive firm, this monopoly firm can
decisively influence the price in this market because its choices decisively alter the total
supply. Recognizing this effect, the monopolist’s profit-maximizing behavior will differ
from that of a competitive firm and so will change the market equilibrium.

Because the monopolist’s demand curve slopes downward, any increased production by
the monopolist will lead to a price reduction. Consider, for instance, Figure 2.3. Here, a
monopolist who is considering selling either _Q_ 1 or _Q_ 2 units faces the following dilemma.
If production is restricted to _Q_ 1 units, the market price will be _P_ 1. If instead production
is set at _Q_ 2 however, the market price will fall to _P_ 2. Accordingly, the monopolist is very
different from the competitive firm that reckons that every additional unit sold will bring
in revenue equal to the current market price. Instead, the monopolist knows that every unit
sold will bring in marginal revenue less than the existing price. Because the additional
output can be sold only if the price declines, the marginal revenue from an additional unit
sold is not market price but something less.

In Figure 2.3, the components of marginal revenue for a monopolist are illustrated by the
shaded areas _G_ and _L_ . These areas reflect the two forces affecting the monopolist’s revenue

the price falls, _P_ 1 _P_ 2, times the original output level, _Q_ 1. This reflects the revenue lost on
the initial _Q_ 1 units as a result of cutting the price to − _P_ 2. The net change in the monopolist’s
revenue is the difference between the gain and the loss, or _G_ - _L_ .



We can be more precise about this. Let _�Q_ _Q_ 2 _Q_ 1, and _�P_ _P_ 1 _P_ 2. The slope

an increase in output _�Q_ [4] leads to a decline in price _�P_ equal to − _B�Q_ . Because total
revenue is defined as price per unit times the number of units sold, we can write total
revenue as a function of the firm’s output decision, or _R(Q)_ = _P(Q)Q_ = _(A_ - _BQ)Q_ . As
just shown in Figure 2.3, the change in revenue, _�R(Q)_, due to the increase in output, _�Q_,
is the sum of two effects. The first is the revenue gain, _P_ 2 _�Q_ . The second is the revenue
loss, _Q_ 1 _�P_ . Hence,


_�R(Q)_ _P_ 2 _�Q_ _Q_ 1 _�P_ _(A_ _BQ_ 2 _)�Q_ _Q_ 1 _(B�Q)_ (2.1)
=     - =     -     
where we have used the demand curve to substitute _A_ - _BQ_ 2 for _P_ 2 in the first term on
the right-hand side. _MR(Q)_ is measured on a per-unit basis. Hence, we must divide the
change in revenue shown in equation (2.1) by the change in output, _�Q_, to obtain marginal
revenue. This yields


_MR(Q)_ _[�][R][(Q)]_ _A_ _BQ_ 2 _BQ_ 1 _A_ 2 _BQ_ (2.2)
= _�Q_ =     -     - ≈     

Here we have used the approximation, _B(Q_ 1 _Q_ 2 _)_ 2 _BQ_ . This will be legitimate so long
as we are talking about small changes in output, i.e., so long as + ≈ _Q_ 2 is fairly close to _Q_ 1.

Equation (2.2)—sometimes referred to as the “twice as steep rule”—is very important,
and we will make frequent reference to it throughout the text. It not only illustrates that
the monopolist’s marginal revenue is less than the current price but, for the case of linear
demand, also demonstrates the precise relationship between price and marginal revenue.
The equation for the monopolist’s marginal revenue function, _MR(Q)_ = _A_ - 2 _BQ_, has
the same price intercept _A_ as the monopolist’s demand curve but twice the slope, −2 _B_
versus just − _B_ . In other words, when the market demand curve is linear, the monopolist’s
marginal revenue curve starts from the same vertical intercept as that demand curve, but
is everywhere twice as steeply sloped. It follows that the monopolist’s marginal revenue
curve must then lie everywhere below the inverse demand curve.

In Figure 2.4, we show both the market demand curve and the corresponding marginal
revenue curve facing the monopolist. Again, profit maximization requires that a firm
produce up to the point where the marginal revenue associated with the last unit of output
just covers the marginal cost of producing that unit. This is true for the monopoly firm as
well as for the perfectly competitive firm. The key difference here is that for the monopoly
firm, marginal revenue is less than price. For the monopoly firm, the profit-maximizing rule
of marginal revenue equal to marginal cost, or _MR(Q)_ _MC(Q)_, holds at the output _QM_ .
=
The monopolist therefore produces at this level and sells each unit at the price _PM_ . Observe
that, at this output level, the revenue received from selling the last unit of output _MR_ is
less than the price at which that output is sold, _MR(QM_ _) < PM_ . It is this fact that leads the
monopolist to produce an output below the (short-run) equilibrium output of a competitive
industry, _QC_ .

We have also drawn the average cost function for the monopoly firm in Figure 2.4. The
per-unit cost of producing output _QM_, described on the average cost curve by _AC(QM_ _)_, is
less than the price _PM_ at which the monopolist sells the good. This means, of course, that


4 Under perfect competition, firm output is different from industry output. So we use a lower case _q_ to refer
to firm output and an upper case _Q_ for industry output. Under monopoly, firm output is the market output
and so we use _Q_ to describe both.

**Figure 2.4** The textbook monopoly case
The monopolist maximizes profit by choosing the output, _QM_, at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
The price at which this output can be sold is identified by the demand curve as _PM_, which exceeds marginal cost.
Profit is _PM_ _abAC(QM_ _)_ . The competitive industry would have instead produced _QC_, at which point price equals
marginal cost.


total revenue exceeds total cost, and the monopolist earns a positive economic profit. This
profit is shown as the rectangle _PM_ _abAC(QM_ _)_ . Furthermore, because the monopolist is the
only firm in this market, and because we assume that no other firm can enter and supply
this good, this market outcome is a long-run equilibrium. Each consumer buys as much as
he wants to at price _PM_ and, given these cost demand conditions, the monopolist has no
incentive to sell more or to sell less.



The monopolist has 50 identical plants to run, each with the same cost function as described
in that problem. Hence, the marginal cost function for the multiplant monopolist [5] is
described by _MC(Q)_ = 10 + _Q/_ 25. The market demand is also assumed to be the same as

5 Cost minimization for any multiplant firm requires that the marginal unit be produced at the plant with the
lowest marginal cost. With divisible output, this implies that the profit-maximizing monopolist will want
to allocate total production across the fifty plants in such a way that the marginal cost of producing the
last unit of output is the same in each plant. Therefore, the monopolist derives the overall marginal cost
function in a manner similar to how we constructed the supply function for the competitive industry. See
Chapter 4, footnote 3 and the Appendix.

2.2 ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND THE SOCIAL SURPLUS


Now that we have described the perfectly competitive and pure monopoly market outcomes,
it is time to try to understand why perfect competition is extolled and pure monopoly is
judged harshly by economists. In both cases firms are driven by profit maximization. Also,
in both cases the firms sell to consumers who decide how much they want to buy at any given
price. What makes one market good and the other market not? The answer to this question
does not reflect any concern about too much profit or firms “ripping off” consumers. The
answer instead lies in the economic concept of efficiency. In economics, efficiency has a
very precise meaning. Briefly speaking, a market outcome is said to be efficient when it is
impossible to find some small change in the allocation of capital, labor, goods, or services
that would improve the well being of one individual without hurting any others. [6] If the only
way we can make somebody better off is by making someone else worse off, then there is
really no slack or inefficiency in how the market is working. If, on the other hand, we can
imagine changes that would somehow allow one person to have more goods and services
while nobody else has less, then the current market outcome is not efficient. As it turns
out, that is precisely the case for a monopolized market. One can think of changes to the
monopoly outcome that would yield more for at least one individual and no less for any
other.

It is readily apparent that to implement our efficiency criterion we need some measure
of how well off consumers and firms are in any market outcome. For this purpose, we use
the notions of consumer surplus and producer surplus. The consumer surplus obtained from
consuming one unit of the good is defined as the difference between the maximum amount
a consumer is willing to pay for that unit and the amount the consumer actually does pay.
Total consumer surplus in a market is then measured by summing this difference over each
unit of the good bought in the market. Analogously, the producer surplus obtained from
producing a single unit of the good is the difference between the amount the seller receives
for that unit of the good and the cost of producing it. Total producer surplus in a market is
then measured by summing up this difference over each unit of the good sold.


2.2.1 Economic Efficiency and Surplus in a Competitive Market

We illustrate these concepts in Figure 2.5. In the competitive outcome, _QC_ units of the
good are bought and sold. The maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for the last
unit, the _QC_ th unit, is just the equilibrium price _PC_ . However, the maximum amount a
consumer is willing to pay for the first, the second, the third, and so on, up to the _QC_ th
unit is greater than _PC_ . We know this because, at a given sales volume, the demand curve
is a precise measure of the maximum amount any consumer is willing to pay for one more
unit. Hence, the area under the demand curve but above the market equilibrium price _PC_ is
surplus to consumers. It is a measure of how much they were willing to pay less what they
actually did pay in the competitive outcome. This is shown in Figure 2.5 as area _abc_ .


6 This notion of efficiency is often referred to as Pareto Optimality after the great Italian social thinker of
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Vilfredo Pareto.

**Figure 2.5** Competition maximizes the total surplus
At the competitive price _PC_ and output _QC_, consumers enjoy a surplus equal to triangle _abc_ . Producers enjoy a
surplus equal to triangle _cbd_ . This is the maximum. Producing less would lose some of the total surplus given by
triangle _abd_ . Subsidizing production to output _QG_ reduces the price to _PG_ . The required subsidy is _gfh_ .
Consumers gain additional surplus _cbge_ . However, this amount represents a transfer of surplus from producers to
consumers and thus, no net gain in total surplus. Consumers also gain the triangle _gbh_, but this is more than
offset by the funds required for the needed subsidy. The remaining part of the subsidy equal to triangle _bfh_ is a
deadweight loss as resources valued more highly in alternative uses are transferred to the industry in question
where the marginal value of output is only _PG_ .


For competitive producers, the supply curve tells us the marginal cost of producing each
unit. [7] Similar to consumer surplus, we can construct a measure of producer surplus. For
each unit of the good sold, producer surplus is measured by the difference between market
price _PC_ and the corresponding reservation supply price on the supply curve. By adding
up this difference for each value of output up to the competitive output, we obtain total
producer surplus. This is illustrated by the area _cbd_ in Figure 2.5.

Note that when the equilibrium quantity, _QC_, of the good is produced and sold at price
_PC_, the total surplus or welfare to consumers and producers is given by the area _abd_ . [8]

Suppose that an output greater than _QC_, say _Q_ G, was produced in this market. For
consumers to buy this quantity of the good, the price must fall to _PG_ . This rise in production
and sales results in an increase in consumer surplus. Specifically, consumer surplus increases
to _aeh_ . Producer surplus, however, falls. Moreover, it falls by more than the increase in
consumer surplus. Much of the rise in consumer surplus that results from moving to output
_Q_ G—in particular, the shaded area _cbge_ —is not an increase in total surplus. It simply
reflects a transfer of surplus from producers to consumers. As for the additional increase in


7 Again, remember that the market supply curve is the horizontal summation of each competitive firm’s
marginal cost curve, and so the supply curve tells us exactly what is the opportunity cost to the firm of
producing and selling each unit of the good.
8 Observe that the unit of measurement of the areas of consumer and producer surplus is the dollar. To work
out the areas you must take $/unit, as measured on the vertical axis, times units on the horizontal axis.
This gives you a measure in dollars, which is a money measure of the welfare created by having this good
produced at output level _QC_ and sold at price _PC_ .


30 Foundations


consumer surplus—the triangle _gbh_ —this is clearly less than the additional decrease in
producer surplus—the triangle _gfh_ . Producers now receive a positive surplus only on the
first _Q_ ’ units produced. Because the gain in consumer surplus is less than the loss in
producer surplus, the overall surplus at output _Q_ G is less than that at output _QC_ . It is easy
to repeat this analysis for any output greater than _QC_ . In short, we cannot increase total
surplus by raising output beyond the competitive level; we can only decrease it.

A similar thought experiment will show that output levels below _QC_ also reduce the total
surplus (see Practice Problem 2.3). This is because restricting output to be less than _QC_
reduces consumer surplus by more than it raises producer surplus. Accordingly, the overall
surplus at an output below _QC_ must be smaller than the surplus under perfect competition.
Note that saying that neither an increase nor a decrease in output from _QC_ can increase the
total surplus but only decrease it is equivalent to saying that the total surplus is maximized
at _QC_ . Yet if we cannot increase the total surplus then we cannot make anyone better off
without making someone worse off. That is, if we cannot make the size of the pie bigger,
we can only give more to some individuals by giving less to others. Because this is the case
under perfect competition, the perfectly competitive output is efficient. [9]


industry. Use the information in Practice Problem 2.1 to work out consumer surplus and
producer surplus in a competitive equilibrium.


a. Show that when _Q_ _[C]_ = 500 units and _P_ _[C]_ = $30 per unit then consumer surplus is
equal to $22,500 and producer surplus is equal to $5,000. This results in a total surplus
equal to $27,500.
b. Show that when an output of 275 units is produced in this industry, the sum of consumer
and producer surplus falls to $21,931.25.


2.2.2 The Monopolist and the Social Surplus


Now consider the monopoly outcome. If this is inefficient, it must be possible to show that
by producing an output level different from the monopoly output _QM_, the total surplus
rises. The way to show this is similar to the solution to Practice Problem 2.3 and is shown
in Figure 2.6. This figure shows the competitive output and price, _QC_ and _PC_ respectively,
much as in Figure 2.5. However, in Figure 2.6 we also show what happens when the industry
is monopolized. The monopolist produces output _QM_ and sets price _PM_ . Consumer surplus
is then the triangle _jax_ . The monopolist’s profit at _QM_ is measured by area _jxzk_ . The sum
of these two surpluses is _axzk_ . This is clearly smaller than the area _ayk_, which measures the
total surplus obtained in the perfectly competitive outcome.

It is worth noting that while the total surplus is greater under perfect competition than
it is under monopoly, the opposite holds true for producer surplus. True, a move from
monopoly to competition gains the producer surplus _wyz_ . But to achieve this gain requires


9 We focus here on the concept of allocational or static efficiency, in which we examine the best way to
allocate resources for the production of a given set of goods and services with a given technology. Dynamic
efficiency, which considers the allocation of resources so as to promote the development of new goods and
new production techniques, is addressed explicitly in Chapter 20.

setting the competitive price _PC_ and the consequent loss of the firm’s surplus, _hjxw_ . The
loss is greater than the gain.

Note that the reduction in consumer surplus that monopoly causes is not purely the
result of an increase in the monopolist’s surplus. Quite the contrary, the decline in total
surplus alerts us to the fact that the monopolist’s gain is less than the consumer’s loss.
In other words, as a result of moving from a competitive industry to one of monopoly,
consumers lose more than the profit that the monopolist earns. They also lose an additional
amount—the area _xwy_ in Figure 2.6—beyond that part of their surplus that is transferred to
the monopolist.

The area of the shaded triangle _xyz_ is an exact measure of inefficiency under monopoly.
The upper boundary of this triangle comprises points that lie on the consumers’ demand
curve. Every point on this boundary indicates the marginal value that consumers place on
successive increases in output beyond _QM_ . The lower boundary of this triangle traces out
the marginal cost of producing this additional output. The triangle _xyz_ thus reflects all the
trades that generate a surplus but that do not take place under monopoly. Within this triangle,
the price that consumers would willingly pay exceeds the cost of producing extra units,
and this difference is the surplus lost—that is, earned by no one—due to monopolization
of the industry. If this additional output were produced, there would be a way to distribute
it and make one person better off without lowering the profit of the monopolist or the
welfare of any other individual. The triangle _xyz_ is often referred to as the deadweight loss
of monopoly. It is also a good approximation of the gains to be had by restructuring the
industry to make it a competitive one.

Again, it is worth repeating that the deadweight loss in Figure 2.6 is not due to the
excess profit of the monopolist. From the viewpoint of economic efficiency, we do not care
whether the surplus generated in a market goes to consumers—as it does under perfect
competition—or to producers. The welfare triangle in Figure 2.6 is a loss because it reflects
the potential surplus that would have gone to someone—consumers or producers—had the
efficient output been produced. It is not the division of the surplus but its total amount that
is addressed by economic efficiency.


32 Foundations


Efficiency is a powerful concept both because of its underlying logic and because it is
open to explicit computation. With appropriate statistical techniques, economists can try to
calculate the deadweight loss of Figure 2.6 for a given industry. Hence, they can estimate
the potential gains from moving to a more competitive market.


linear function _Q_ = 50 − 2 _P_ . The total cost function for water production is also a linear
function: _TC(Q)_ = 100 + 10 _Q_ . You will also need to work out both the average cost of
production, denoted by _AC(Q)_, equal to the total cost of producing a quantity of output
divided by that quantity of output, _TC(Q)/Q_, and the marginal cost of production, denoted
by _MC(Q)_, which is the additional cost incurred to produce one more unit.

2.3 INTERTEMPORAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS
ON MONOPOLY POWER


Both the competition and the monopoly models described in the previous section are
somewhat vague with respect to time. While some distinction is made between the short
run and the long run, neither concept explicitly confronts the notion of a unit of time
such as a day, a week, a month, or a year, or of how many such units constitute say,
the long run. To maximize profit in the long run requires, for example, only that the firm
make all necessary adjustments to its inputs in order to produce at the optimum level, and
then repeatedly choose this input–output combination in every individual period. From the
standpoint of decision making then, the long run is envisioned as a single market period and
the assumption that the firm will seek to maximize profit is unambiguous in its meaning.

However, the recognition that the long run is a series of individual, finite time periods
extending far into the future also raises the possibility that each such period will not be
the same. The choice may well be between taking an action that yields profit immediately
versus taking an action that yields perhaps greater profit but not until many periods later.
In such a setting, the meaning of maximizing profit is less clear. Is it better or worse to
have more profit later and less profit now? How does one compare profit in one period with
profit in another? Such questions must be answered if we are to provide a useful analysis
of the strategic interaction among firms over time.

Sacrificing profit today means incurring a cost. Hence, the problem just described arises
anytime that a cost is incurred in the present in return for benefits to be realized much
later. Firms often face such a trade-off. A classic example is the decision to build a new
manufacturing plant. If the plant is constructed now, the firm will immediately incur the
expense of hiring architects and construction workers and the buying of building materials,
machinery, and equipment. It will only be sometime later—after the plant is built and
running smoothly—that the firm will actually begin to earn some profit or return on this
investment.


Basic Microeconomics 33


2.3.1 Discounting, Present Value, and Intertemporal Trades


In order to understand how firms make decisions in which the costs and benefits are
experienced not just in one period but instead over time, we borrow some insights from
financial markets. After all, the comparison of income received (or foregone) at different
points in time is really what financial markets are all about. Think for a moment. If one buys
some stock in, say, Microsoft, one has to give up some funds today—namely, the price of
a share in Microsoft times the number of shares bought. Of course, investors do this every
day. Thousands of Microsoft shares are bought every day of the week. These investors are
thus sacrificing some of their current wealth—which could alternatively be used to purchase
a Caribbean vacation, wardrobe, or other consumer goods—to buy these shares. Why do
investors do this? The answer is that they do so in the expectation that those shares will pay
dividends and will also appreciate in value over time. That is, stockholders buy shares of
stock and incur the associated investment expense now, in the hope that the ownership of
those shares will generate income later in the form of dividends and capital gains.

In short, the financial markets are explicitly involved in trading current for future income.
Accordingly, we can use the techniques of those markets to evaluate similar trades of
current versus future profit that a firm might make. The key insight that we borrow from
financial markets is the notion of present value or discounting. To understand the concept of
discounting, imagine that a friend has asked to borrow $1,000 for twelve months. Suppose
further that for you to lend her money requires that you withdraw $1,000 from your checking
account, an account that pays 3 percent interest per year. In other words, you will have to
lose about $30 of interest income by making this withdrawal. Although you like your friend
very much, you may not see precisely why you should make her a gift of $30. Therefore,
you agree to lend her the $1,000 today if, a year from now, she pays you not only the $1,000
of principal but also an additional $30 in interest. Your friend will likely agree. After all,
if she borrowed from the bank directly she would have to pay at least as much. The bank
cannot afford to pay you 3 percent per year if it does not charge an interest rate at least as
high when it loans those funds out. In fact, the bank will probably charge an interest rate a
bit higher to cover its expenses. Therefore, it makes sense for your friend to agree that you
give her $1,000 today and that she give you $1,030 in twelve months.

Quite explicitly, you and your friend have just negotiated a trade of present funds for
future funds. In fact, you have established the exact terms at which such a trade can take
place. One thousand dollars today may be exchanged for $1,030 one year from now. Of
course, matters would have been a bit different if the interest rate that your bank paid
on deposits had been 5 percent. In that case, you would have asked your friend for $50
(5 percent of $1,000) in repayment beyond the $1,000 originally borrowed. That would
have been the only repayment that would truly compensate you for your loss of the interest
on your bank deposit. In general, if we denote the interest rate as _r_, then we have that
$1,000 today exchanges for _(_ 1 + _r)_ times $1,000 in one year. If we now become even more
general and consider an initial loan amount different from $1,000, say of _Y_, we will quickly
see that the same logic implies that _Y_ today trades for _(_ 1 + _r)Y_ paid in twelve months.

There is, however, an alternative way to view the transactions just described. Instead of
asking how much money one will receive in a year for giving up $1,000 (or _Y_ ) now, we
can reverse the question. That is, we can ask instead how much we have to pay today in
order to get a particular payment one year from the present. For example, we could ask how
much it would cost right now to buy a contract requiring that the other party to the deal pay
us $1,030 in a year. If the interest rate is 3 percent, the answer is easy. It is simply $1,000.

In fact, this is the contract with your friend that we just considered. You essentially paid
$1,000 to purchase a promise from your friend to pay you $1,030 in one year. The intuition
is that at an interest rate of 3 percent, the banks and the financial markets are saying that in
return for a deposit of $1,000 they promise to pay $1,030 in one year. In other words, we can
buy the contract we are thinking about for exactly $1,000 from the banks. There’s no sense
in paying more for it from anyone else, and no one else is going to accept less. Therefore,
when the interest rate is 3 percent, the market is saying that the current price of a contract
promising to pay $1,030 in one year is exactly $1,030 _/(_ 1.03 _)_ or $1,000. Because price is
just the economist’s term for value, we call this the present value or, more completely, the
present discounted value of $1,030 due in twelve months.

More generally, the present value of a piece of paper (e.g., a loan contract or share
of stock) promising its owner a payment of _Z_ in one period is just _Z/(_ 1 + _r)_ . The term
1 _/(_ 1 + _r)_ is typically referred to as the discount factor and is often presented just as _R_ . In
other words, _R_ = 1 _/(_ 1 + _r)_ . Hence, the present value of _Z_ dollars one year from now is
often written as _RZ_ . The source of the adjective discount should be clear. Income that does
not arrive until a year from now is not as valuable as income received today. Instead, the
value of such future income is discounted. This has nothing to do with inflation and any
possible cheapening of the currency over time. It simply reflects the fact that individuals
prefer to have their consumption now and have to be paid a premium—an interest rate
return—in order to be persuaded to wait.

What if the term of the loan had been for two years? Let us return again to our original
example of a $1,000 loan at 3 percent interest. If your friend had initially asked to borrow
the funds for two years, your reasoning might have gone as follows. Making a two-year
loan to my friend requires that I take $1,000 out of my checking account today. Not making
the loan means that the $1,000 stays in the bank. In this case, I will earn 3 percent over the
next twelve months and, accordingly, start the next year with $1,030 in the bank. I will then
earn 3 percent on this amount over the next or second year. Accordingly, by refusing my
friend and keeping the funds in the bank, I will have on deposit $1,030 _(_ 1.03 _)_ = $1,060.90
in two years. Therefore, I will only lend my friend the funds for two years if she in turn
promises to pay me $1,060.90—the same as I could have earned at the bank—when the loan
expires twenty-four months from now. Note that the amount $1,060.90 can be alternatively
expressed as $1,000 _(_ 1.03 _)(_ 1.03 _)_ = $1,000 _(_ 1.03 _)_ [2] . In general, a loan today of amount _Y_
will yield _Y(_ 1 + _r)_ [2] or _YR_ [−][2] in two years. By extension, a loan of _Y_ dollars for _t_ years
will yield an amount of _Y(_ 1 + _r)_ _[t]_ or _YR_ [−] _[t]_ when it matures _t_ years from now.

As before, we can turn the question around and ask how much we need to pay currently
in order to receive an amount of _Z_ dollars at some date _t_ periods into the future. The answer
follows immediately from our work above. It is _R_ _[t]_ _Z_ . How do we know this? If we put
the amount _R_ _[t]_ _Z_ dollars in an interest-bearing account today, then the amount that can be
withdrawn in _t_ periods is, by our previous logic, _(R_ _[t]_ _Z)R_ [−] _[t]_ = _Z_ . So, clearly, the present
discounted value of an amount _Z_ to be received _t_ periods in the future is just _R_ _[t]_ _Z_ .

The only remaining question is how to value a claim that provides different amounts at
different dates in the future. For example, consider the construction of a plant that will,
after completion in one year, generate _Z_ 1 in net revenue; a net revenue of _Z_ 2 two years
from now; _Z_ 3 three years from now; and so on. What is the present value of this stream of
future net revenues?

The present value of _Z_ 1 in one period is, as we know, _RZ_ 1. Similarly, the present value
of the _Z_ 2 to be received in two periods is _R_ [2] _Z_ 2. If we continue in this manner, we will
work out the present value of the income received at each particular date. The present value


Basic Microeconomics 35


of this entire stream will then simply be the sum of all these individual present values. In
general, the present value _PV_ of a stream of income receipts to be received at different dates
extending _T_ periods into the future is:



_PV_ _RZ_ 1 _R_ [2] _Z_ 2 _R_ [3] _Z_ 3 _. . ._ _R_ _[T]_ _Z_ _[T]_
= + + + + =




- _T_


_t_ =1



_R_ _[t]_ _Zt_ (2.3)



A special case of equation (2.3) occurs when the income received in each period _Z_ t is the
same, that is, when _Z_ 1 _Z_ 2 _. . ._ _ZT_ _Z_ . In that case, the present value of the total
stream is: = = = =


_Z_
_PV_ (2.4)
= _(_ 1 _R)_ _[(R]_ [ −] _[R][T]_ [ +][1] _[)]_
     
An even more special case occurs when not only is the income receipt constant at
_Z_ = _Z_, but also the stream persists into the indefinite future so that the terminal period _T_
approaches infinity. In that case, because the discount factor _R_ is less than one, the term
_R_ _[T]_ [ +][1] in equation (2.4) goes to zero. Hence, when the stream is both constant and perpetual,
the present value formula becomes:








_[Z]_ (2.5)
= _r_



_PV_ = _Z_




_R_
1 − _R_



Thus, if the interest rate _r_ were 3 percent, a promise to pay a constant $30 forever
would have a present value of PV = $30 _/_ 0.03 = $1,000. Note that for all our present value
formulas, an increase in the real interest rate _r_ implies a decrease in the discount factor _R_ .
In turn, this means that a rise in the interest rate implies a decrease in the present value of
any given future income stream.

Again, it is important to remember the context in which these equations have been
developed. Often firm decision-making has a temporal dimension. Indeed, our focus on
long-run equilibria implies that we are considering just such decisions. Hence, we need
to consider trade-offs that are made over time. An expense may need to be incurred
now in order to reap additional profit at some future date or dates. The simple dictum
maximize profit does not have a clear meaning in such cases. The only way of evaluating
the desirability of such a trade-off over time is to discount, that is, translate the future dollar
inflows into a current or present value that may then be compared with the current expense
necessary to secure those future receipts. If the present value of the future income is not at
least as great as the value of the necessary expense, then the trade-off is not favorable. If, for
instance, a plant costs $3 million to build, and will generate future profit with a discounted
present value of only $2 million, it is not a desirable investment, and we would not expect
a rational firm to undertake it. [10] In short, our assumption that firms maximize profit must
now be qualified to mean that firms maximize the present value of all current and future
profit. Of course, for one-period problems, this is identical with the assumption that firms
simply maximize profit. However, we will need to be familiar with the idea of discounting
and the present value of future profits in the second half of the book when we take up such
issues as collusion, research, and development, which often have a multiperiod dimension.


10 We have treated the problem as one of current expenses versus future receipts. Of course, future costs
should be discounted as well.

however, have one rival: Loew Supplies. Because of this competition, Suite earns a profit
of $100,000 per year. It could, however, cut its prices to cost and drive out Loew. To do
this, Suite would have to forego all profit for one year and earn zero. After that year, Loew
would be gone forever and Suite could earn $110,000 per year. The interest rate Suite
confronts is 12 percent per annum, and thus the discount factor _R_ = 0.8929.

a. Is driving Loew out of the market a good “investment” for Suite?
b. Consider the alternative strategy in which Suite buys Loew for $80,000 today and then
operates the newly combined firm, Suite & Loew, as a monopoly earning $110,000 in
all subsequent periods. Is this a good investment?

2.3.2 Time and the Evolution of Industry Structure


Considerations of time also introduce some potential constraints on the exercise of monopoly
power and, consequently, on the amount of welfare loss that accompanies such power. One
such mechanism reflects the dynamics of industrial structure. In our textbook analysis above,
we simply assumed that the market had either a competitive or monopoly structure. We did
not ask how that structure was achieved or whether it is stable. In this sense, the analysis
is short run in character. This is not to say that it is inaccurate. The welfare loss associated
with monopoly pricing is real. There may be some question, though, as to whether it will
be long lasting. Whether or not this is the case depends in part on whether the economic
profit or surplus that the monopoly firm earns will attract entry and competition over time.

As noted earlier, a sensible requirement for a long-run equilibrium is that there is no
incentive for the industry structure to change. In other words, there should be no incentive
for any firm to exit or enter the industry. There are many ways to impose this condition.
The most common one however is to assume that it requires that each firm in the industry
earn zero economic profit. [11] In other words, for each firm, total revenue _Pqi_ equals total
cost _C(qi)_ . Dividing each side by the firm’s output, _qi_, reveals that this is equivalent to
imposing the constraint that firms exit or enter until the market price equals average cost,
where average cost is defined as the ratio of total cost to total production or cost per unit.

We will return to a more complete discussion of average (and marginal) cost again in
Chapter 4 when we discuss the production technology and its implications for the firm’s
costs in some detail. For now, we simply note that imposing the long-run equilibrium
condition that price equals average cost provides a way to determine the equilibrium
structure of the industry. To the extent that that structure has more than one firm in it, that
is, to the extent that the market permits entry by rivals over time, the monopolist’s ability
to sustain a price far above marginal cost will be lessened. Indeed, even if the market only
has one firm, the ability of that firm to price above marginal cost may be sharply curtailed
by the threat of potential entrants who would come into the market readily and undercut
such pricing. This in fact is the fundamental idea behind the idea of contestable markets. [12]

At the same time, it is important to recognize that a firm with monopoly power may
be able to take actions that protect that power against rival entrants over time, and that
push the evolution of market structure toward the monopoly pole. In short, market structure
at any point in time may not be an accurate gauge of the intensity of competition in an
industry. Even a monopolist can be constrained by the prospect of actual or potential entry.
It is equally important to recognize that because both entry and entry deterrence typically
require that a cost be incurred today in return for higher profits in the future, analysis of
these issues inevitably involves comparison of profits at different points of time and the use
of the discounting techniques just discussed.


2.3.3 Durable Goods and the Coase Conjecture


A second way in which attention to time considerations may reveal a constraint on monopoly
power arises in connection with durable goods. Unlike, say, food, many goods such as
household appliances and automobiles last a number of years. In turn, this means that a


11 An alternative approach would be to require that each firm within the industry earns nonnegative profits
(and so have no incentive to leave) while any firm not in the industry would earn nonpositive profit if it
entered (and so have no incentive to do so).
12 See, for example, Baumol, Panzar, and Willig (1982).


38 Foundations


monopolist has to think carefully about the price initially set and the volume sold today.
That supply will still be around to influence market outcomes one or two periods later.
Nobel laureate Ronald Coase argued nearly 40 years ago (Coase 1972) that this durability
might greatly reduce if not eliminate the ability of the monopolist to set prices above the
efficient level even in the current period.

Consider the following example. The time frame has two discrete periods. A monopolist
has two units of a durable good that will provide services to an owner in each of the
two periods with no loss due to depreciation. There are two such potential consumers.
One values the services of the good at $50 per period. The other values these services at
$30 per period. Thus, for the high-value consumer the present value of services from the
good is $50 + _R_ $50 = _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50, while for the low-value consumer it is _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30.
Because the monopolist has the two units already, marginal production cost is zero. In turn,
this implies that the maximum total surplus available in this market is _(_ 1 + _R)_ $80. Any
outcome that yields this surplus is efficient, but any outcome that yields a total surplus less
than _(_ 1 + _R)_ $80 is inefficient.

Of course, the monopolist seeks to maximize his own surplus, not the total surplus. In
doing so, he will recognize the following constraints. First, any first period price below
_(_ 1 + _R)_ $30 will result in both consumers purchasing the good in the first period and the
market process will effectively end, i.e., there will be no more sales in period 2. The
monopolist has nothing left to sell in the second period and both consumers continue
to enjoy the services of the good then because it is durable. Second, any price above
_(_ 1 + _R)_ $30 will result in the sale of either one unit in the first period, if the price is less
than _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50, or no units if it is higher. In the first case, the monopolist will enter the
second period with one unit left, which can then be sold to the low-value consumer for $30.
In the second case, the monopolist will face the choice between selling either both units at
a price of $30 or one unit at a price of $50. Clearly, the best option in this case is to sell
both at $30 for a total second-period profit of $60.

An important implication of the foregoing analysis is that any and all second period sales
must take place at a price of $30. There is simply no way that the monopolist can make
a credible first-period commitment to any second-period price above this amount. Given
this, we can now consider the strategy of making one first-period sale to the high-value
consumer at a price of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50 from the viewpoint of that consumer. The difficulty
with this strategy is then immediately apparent. Confronted with a first-period price of
_(_ 1 + _R)_ $50, the high-value consumer can either buy in the first period—and earn zero
surplus—or defer the purchase to the second-period knowing that the price will then be $30,
and that there will therefore be a surplus of _R_ $20 in present value terms. The high-value
consumer will obviously choose the latter. It follows that the monopolist cannot hope to
make a first-period sale at _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50. The fact that the second-period price must be $30
makes this impossible.

What about a price below _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50 but above _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30? Consider the first-period
price, _(_ 1 + _R)_ $ _(_ 30 + _ε)_, where _ε_ is a small positive constant. Such a price gives the
high-value consumer a surplus of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $ _(_ 20 − _ε)_ . If the consumer instead waits and
purchases the good next period at $30, there will be a surplus with present value _R_ $20.
Thus, in order for the monopolist to sell to this consumer in the first period, it must be the
case that the monopolist offers a price such that
