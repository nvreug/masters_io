114 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


For our immediate concern with price discrimination, the first thing to note is that
those buyers with the most elastic demands and therefore those who pay the lowest prices
tend to be those from census blocks with typically low incomes or high education levels.
Thus, the coefficients on the two income variables imply that the price rises sharply as
the median household income of the buyer’s census block increases above $80,000. The
price is also notably higher for someone likely to have less than a high school education
and falls significantly for those with a college degree. The interpretation of these factors
is straightforward. Those with relatively high incomes have high search costs because the
value of their time is high. Hence, they are willing to pay a high price for a car rather than
spend more time seeking a better deal. Similarly, those with little education are willing to
pay a higher price, all else equal, because they find searching difficult.

SZS pay particular attention to the race and gender effects. Because the race variable is
the percentage of the census block of a specific race, one may take this as an estimate of the
probability that the buyer from that block is also of that race. Thus, if we set either %Black
or %Hispanic to 100, the coefficient will indicate the price differential paid by a black or
Hispanic buyer relative to a white person. The data therefore indicate that Hispanic and
black car buyers pay 1.1% and 1.5% more, respectively, than do white buyers.

Turning to the gender variable (which is assigned primarily on a name basis), the initial
estimate suggests that women pay 0.2% more for a new car than do men. SZS feel that this
may underestimate the gender effect because often a brother, father, boyfriend, or husband
is present in those cases in which the buyer is recorded officially as a woman. They therefore
look separately at the purchase of minivans for which 98 percent of the buyers are married
couples relative to the purchase of compact and sporty cars for which only 48 percent of
the buyers are married couples. The female price premium essentially disappears for the
case of minivans but rises to over four-tenths of a percent for compact car purchases.

Given an average car price of $23,000, the price premia that SZS estimate for minorities
($253–$345) and women ($98) translate into nontrivial dollar amounts. It is natural to
ascribe these extra charges to racial and gender bias. SZS however suggest that it is not
so much bias on the part of dealers as it is the case that the race and gender variables
capture the further measure of search cost difficulty. Recall that the authors also have data
indicating whether or not the buyer used the Internet service, Autobytel, to submit their
purchase request. For this group of buyers—just under 3 percent of all buyers—search
costs should be decidedly smaller. Thus, this group of buyers should pay a lower price, all
else equal. More importantly, if the premium paid by women and minorities is due mainly
to search costs, then use of Autobytel should be particularly helpful to these buyers.

Table 5.4 below shows the effects that SZS estimate for the impact of Autobytel use both
by itself and when it is interacted with each of the important buyer groups. Here, SZS also
include the market research firm’s race assignment (Hispanic or Asian) to supplement the
census block data so as to get as complete an estimate of the internet effect as possible.

Clearly, the use of Autobytel’s Internet service helps reduce prices. Most notably though,
these effects are particularly important for women and minorities. The coefficients above
suggest that for those black and Hispanic buyers who used Autobytel, the earlier premiums
they paid of 1.1 to 1.5 percent are virtually eliminated. For women who use this service,
the effect is smaller but still very significant.

In short, the SZS results confirm our analysis that consumers with high search costs have
less elastic demands and therefore end up paying higher prices. In the case of car buyers,
this includes in particular those with higher incomes and less education. It also includes
minority and female buyers. As a result, it is particularly these buyers who benefit from use
of an Internet-based car-buying service.

**Summary**


We started this chapter with a discussion of prescription drug price differentials that seem not to
be related to costs. In a well-functioning market,
such differentials can only occur if there is something that allows a firm with market power to set
different prices to different groups of consumers.
We showed that a firm with monopoly power can
increase its profits if the firm can figure out a way
to separate its consumers by type and charge different prices to the different types. Our analysis
has concentrated on third-degree price discrimination or group pricing, in which the firm offers
different prices to different consumer groups, but
leaves it up to consumers to determine how much
they will purchase at the quoted prices. This is
often referred to as linear pricing.

In order to implement third-degree price, discrimination the firm has to solve two problems.
First, it needs some observable characteristic by
which it can identify the different groups of consumers: the identification problem. Second, the
firm must be able to prevent consumers who pay
a low price from selling to consumers offered a
high price: the arbitrage problem. Provided that
both problems can be overcome, there is then
a simple principle that guides the monopolist in
setting prices. Set a high price in markets in
which elasticity of demand is low and a low
price in markets in which elasticity of demand
is high. When the firm makes a single homogeneous product, this implies that different groups
of consumers will be paying different prices for



the same good. If the firm sells differentiated
products, it implies that the prices of different
varieties will vary by something other than the
difference in their marginal production costs.

Recent empirical evidence on new car purchases provides support for the hypothesis that
the negotiated auto price will vary inversely
with the buyer’s elasticity which, in turn, varies
inversely with the buyer’s search costs. Buyers
whose search costs are low either because they
are well educated, have a low opportunity cost
of time or, in particular, use Internet buying programs tend to pay significantly lower net prices
for new cars. This last mechanism is particularly
important for minorities and women who otherwise tend to pay 0.2 to 1.5 percent more for a
new care relative to other groups.

While third-degree price discrimination or
group pricing is undoubtedly profitable, it is
less clear that it is socially desirable. Again
there is a simple principle that can guide us.
For third-degree price discrimination to increase
social welfare it is necessary, but not sufficient,
that it lead to an increase in output. This makes
intuitive sense. After all, we know that under
uniform pricing or nondiscrimination a monopolist makes profit by restricting output. If price
discrimination leads to increased output it might
reduce the monopoly distortion. This is, however, a tall order, usually requiring some very
restrictive conditions regarding the shapes of the
demand functions in the different markets. For


116 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice



example, it is a condition that is _never_ satisfied
when demands are linear and the same markets
are served with and without price discrimination.

The qualification regarding the same markets
being served is, however, important. There may
be cases in which group price discrimination has
the beneficial effect of encouraging the monopolist to serve markets that would otherwise have
been left unserved. For example, markets populated by very low income groups might not be
supplied if the monopolist were not able to set
discriminatory prices. When price discrimination
leads the monopolist to serve additional markets,
the likelihood that it increases social welfare is
greatly increased.


**Problems**


1. TRUE or FALSE: Price discrimination
always increases economic efficiency relative to what would be achieved by a single,
uniform monopoly price.


2. A nearby pizza parlor offers pizzas in three
sizes: small, medium, and large. Its corresponding price schedule is: $6 _,_ $8 _,_ and $10.
Do these data indicate that the firm is price
discriminating? Why or why not?


3. A monopolist has two sets of customers. The
inverse demand for Group 1 is described
by _P_ = 200 − _X_ . For Group 2, the inverse
demand is _P_ = 200 − 2 _X_ . The monopolist
faces constant marginal cost of 40.
a. Show that the monopolist’s total
demand, if the two markets are treated
as one is:

_X_ = 0; _P_ ≥ 200
_X_ = 200 − _P_ ; 100 _< P_ ≤ 200
_X_ = 300 − _(_ 3 _/_ 2 _)P_ ; 0 _< P_ ≤ 100

b. Show that the monopolist’s profit maximizing price is _P_ = 120 if both groups
are to be charged the same price. At this
price, how much is sold to members of
Group 1 and how much to members of
Group 2? What is the consumer surplus
of each group? What are total profits?


4. Now suppose that the monopolist in #3 can
separate the two groups and charge separate,
profit-maximizing prices to each group
a. What will these prices be? What is consumer surplus? What are total profits?



We conclude by noting one limitation of
focusing on third-degree price discrimination.
Restricting the monopolist to simple, linear forms
of price discrimination is qualitatively the same
as allowing it to charge a monopoly price in
each of its separate markets. Yet we know that
in any given market, charging a monopoly price
reduces the surplus. The monopolist knows this
too and, therefore, cannot help but wonder if a
more complicated—that is, a nonlinear pricing
strategy—might permit the monopolist to capture more of the potential surplus as profit. It is
to this question that we turn in the next chapter.


b. If total surplus is consumer surplus
plus profit, how has price discrimination
affected total surplus?


5. Suppose that Coca-Cola uses a new type
of vending machine that charges a price
according to the outside temperature. On
“hot” days—defined as days in which the
outside temperature is 25 degrees Celsius
or higher—demand for vending machine
soft drinks is: _Q_ = 300 − 2 _P_ . On “cool”
days—when the outside temperature is
below 25 degrees Celsius—demand is: _Q_ =
200 − 2 _P_ . The marginal cost of a canned
soft drink is 20 cents.
a. What price should the machine charge
for a soft drink on “hot” days? What
price should it charge on “cool” days?
b. Suppose that half of the days are “hot”
and the other half are “cool.” If CocaCola uses a traditional machine that is
programmed to charge the same price
regardless of the weather, what price
should it set?
c. Compare Coca-Cola’s profit from a
weather-sensitive machine to the traditional, uniform pricing machine.


6. Return to the final example of section 5.5,
in which the demand for AIDS drugs was
_QN_ 100 _P_ in North America and _QS_
_α_ 100 = − _P_ in Sub-Saharan Africa. Show that − =
with marginal _cost_ = 20 for such drugs, it
must be the case that _α >_ 0.531 if the drug
manufacturer is to serve both markets while


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Linear Pricing 117



charging the same price in each market.
(HINT: Calculate the total profit if it serves
only North America and then calculate the
total profit if it serves both markets. Then
determine the value of _α_ for which the
profit from serving both markets is at least
as large.)


7. Frank Buckley sells his famous bad tasting but very effective cough medicine in
Toronto and Montreal. The demand functions in these two urban areas, respectively,
Buckley’s plant is located in Kingston,are: _PT_ = 18 − _QT_ and _PM_ = 14 − _QM_ .
Ontario, which is roughly midway between
the two cities. As a result, the cost of producing and delivering cough syrup to each
town is: 2 + 3 _Qi_ where _i_ = _T, M_ .

DISCRIMINATORY AND NONDISCRIMINATORY PRICING


Let a monopolist supply two groups of consumers with inverse demand given by:


_P_ 1 _A_ 1 _B_ 1 _Q_ 1
=   
_P_ 2 _A_ 2 _B_ 2 _Q_ 2 (5.A1)
=   

118 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


We assume that _A_ 1 _> A_ 2 so that group 1 is the “high demand” group whose demand is the
less elastic at any given price. Inverting the inverse demands gives the direct demands at
some price _P_ :


_Q_ 1 _(A_ 1 _P)/B_ 1 _Q_ 2 _(A_ 2 _P)/B_ 2 (5.A2)
=   - ; =   
Aggregate demand is:



_Q_ _Q_ 1 _Q_ 2 _[A]_ [1] _[B]_ [2][ +] _[ A]_ [2] _[B]_ [1]
= + = _B_ 1 _B_ 2




- _[B]_ _B_ [1][ +] 1 _B_ _[ B]_ 2 [2]



_P_ (5.A3)



Of course, this holds only for any price less that _A_ 2. Aggregate inverse demand for the two
groups, again for any price less than _A_ 2 is:



_P_ _[A]_ [1] _[B]_ [2][ +] _[ A]_ [2] _[B]_ [1]
= _B_ 1 _B_ 2

+



_B_ 1 _B_ 2

- _B_ 1 _B_ 2
+



_Q_ (5.A3)



The marginal revenue associated with this aggregate demand is:



_MR_ _[A]_ [1] _[B]_ [2][ +] _[ A]_ [2] _[B]_ [1]
= _B_ 1 _B_ 2

+



2 _[B]_ [1] _[B]_ [2]

- _B_ 1 _B_ 2

+



_Q_ (5.A4)



Without loss of generality, assume that marginal cost is zero. Equilibrium aggregate
output _Q_ _[U]_ and price _P_ _[U]_ with uniform pricing is then:



_Q_ _[U]_ _[A]_ [1] _[B]_ [2][ +] _[ A]_ [2] _[B]_ [1]
= 2 _B_ 1 _B_ 2



_P_ _[U]_ _[A]_ [1] _[B]_ [2][ +] _[ A]_ [2] _[B]_ [1] (5.A5)
; = 2 _(B_ 1 _B_ 2 _)_

+



Substituting this price into the individual demands then gives equilibrium output in each
market




_[U]_ 1 _[(]_ [2] _[A]_ [1][ −] _[A]_ [2] _[)B]_ [1][ +] _[ A]_ [1] _[B]_ [2]

[=] 2 _B_ 1 _(B_ 1 _B_ 2 _)_

# **6** **Price Discrimination and Monopoly:** **Nonlinear Pricing**

If you buy the _New Yorker_ magazine at the newsstand, you will pay $4.99 per issue, or
$234.53 if you buy all forty-seven issues. If instead you purchase an annual subscription
you will pay $69.99 for forty-seven issues—a savings of approximately 70 percent over the
newsstand price. Similarly, if you are a baseball fan you know that the price per ticket on a
season pass is much less than the price per ticket on a game-by-game basis. When you go
grocery shopping you find that a 24-pack of Coca-Cola costs less on a price-per-can basis
than a six-pack or than a single can. These are all examples of price discrimination that
reflect quantity discounts—the more you buy the cheaper it is on a per-unit basis.

Quantity discounting is just a way of saying that firms are employing _nonlinear_ prices. The
price per unit is not constant but rather varies with some feature of the buying arrangement
depending, perhaps, on the consumer’s income, value of time, the quantity bought or other
characteristics. Such a pricing strategy differs from the linear price discrimination methods
discussed in Chapter 5. The goal of nonlinear pricing is to allow the seller to convert as
much of the individual consumer’s willingness to pay into revenues and profits as possible.
We shall see that such techniques are generally more profitable than third-degree price
discrimination or linear pricing, precisely because they permit the seller to set a price closer
to willingness to pay _of each consumer_ . As a result, nonlinear pricing helps the monopolist to
earn more profit.

The design and implementation of nonlinear pricing strategies are this chapter’s focus.
We explore how and under what circumstances a firm with market power can implement
such pricing schemes and examine their welfare properties. Traditionally, nonlinear pricing
is divided into two general categories: first-degree price discrimination and second-degree
price discrimination or, as Shapiro and Varian (1999) categorize them, personalized pricing
and menu pricing. See both Pigou (1920) and Philips (1983) for an elaboration of price
discrimination categories.


6.1 FIRST-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION OR
PERSONALIZED PRICING


First-degree, or perfect price discrimination is practiced when the monopolist is able to
charge the maximum price each consumer is willing to pay for _each_ unit of the product
sold. Suppose that you have inherited five antique cars, each a classic Ford _Model T_, and


120 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


that you want to sell them to finance your college education. They are of no other value to
you. Your market research tells you that there are several collectors interested in buying
a _Model T_ . When you rank these collectors in terms of their willingness to pay for a car,
you estimate that the keenest collector is willing to pay up to $10,000, the second up to
$8,000, the third up to $6,000, the fourth $4,000, and the fifth $2,000. First-degree price
discrimination means that you are able sell the first car for $10,000, the second for $8,000,
the third for $6,000, the fourth for $4,000, and the fifth car for $2,000. The revenue from
such a discriminatory pricing policy is $30,000. Not surprisingly, this strategy is also called
personalized pricing.

What if, on the other hand, you chose to sell your antiques at the same, uniform price?
It is easy to calculate that the best you can do is to set a price of $6,000 at which you sell
three cars for a total revenue (and profit) of $18,000. Any higher or lower price generates
lower revenues. In short, under uniform pricing your highest possible revenue is $18,000
while successful first-degree price discrimination yields a much higher revenue of $30,000.
Why? Very simply because first-degree price discrimination enables you to extract the
entire surplus that selling your car generates. No consumer surplus remains if you can
successfully discriminate to this extent whereas with a uniform price the keenest buyer has
consumer surplus of $4,000 and the second keenest buyer has consumer surplus of $2,000.

Because first-degree price discrimination, or personalized pricing, redirects surplus from
consumers to the firm, it should be expected to increase the monopolist’s profit-maximizing
output. In fact, as we shall see, with first-degree price discrimination the monopolist chooses
the socially efficient output: the output that would be achieved under perfect competition.
In our _Model T_ example, no mutually beneficial trades are left unmade: all five cars are
sold. By contrast, with uniform pricing only three cars are sold leaving two of the cars in
the “wrong” hands: there are two potential buyers who value the cars much more highly
than you do.

The same is true in more general cases. For a monopolist able to practice first-degree
price discrimination, selling an additional unit never requires lowering the price on other
units. Each additional unit sold generates additional revenue exactly equal to the price at
which it is sold. Hence, with first-degree price discrimination marginal revenue is equal to
price. Accordingly, for such a monopolist, the profit maximizing rule that marginal revenue
equals marginal cost yields an output level at which price equals marginal cost as well. As
we know, this is the output level that would be generated by a competitive industry.


that at a price of $40, five units can be sold, while at a price of $25, 10 units are sold.


a. If each potential consumer buys only one unit, what is the reservation price of the
consumer with the greatest willingness to pay?
b. Suppose that the monopolist discovers that the demand curve worked out in (a) applies
only to the first unit a consumer buys and that, in fact, each consumer will buy a second
unit at a price $8 below the price at which they purchase just one. How many units will
be sold at a price of $34? (Use whole dollar amounts.)


At first glance it might seem that first-degree discrimination is little more than a theoretical
curiosity. How could a monopolist ever have sufficient information about potential buyers
and the ability to prevent arbitrage so as to effectively implement a pricing scheme in


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Nonlinear Pricing 121


which a different, personalized price is charged to each buyer and for each unit bought? The
problems of identification and arbitrage prevention seem insurmountable. However, in some
cases the monopolist seller may indeed have the ability to achieve the personalized pricing
outcome. A tax accountant knows the financial situation of his or her clients. Management
consultants typically negotiate their fees with individual clients. Another example, rather
closer to home, is the fees paid by students who apply to any of the (expensive) private
universities in the United States. When they apply for financial aid, they are required to
complete a detailed statement of financial means. The universities of course can use this
information, as well SAT scores and other data, to determine the aid to be granted and so
the net tuition that each prospective student is required to pay. Look around you. If you
break down the total tuition on a per class basis, chances are that many of your classmates
are paying a different fee for this class than you are!

Of course, the accountant, consultant, and university examples are somewhat special
because often the fee is set _after_ the customer has contracted to purchase the service. What
we now consider is whether there are pricing strategies that permit the seller to achieve the
same effect even when fees must be announced in advance. The answer is yes, in some
circumstances. One such strategy is a _two-part_ pricing scheme. Another is _block pricing_ .
We discuss each in turn.

122 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


6.1.1 Two-Part Pricing


A two-part pricing scheme is a pricing strategy that consists of: 1) a fixed fee, such as
a membership fee, that entitles the consumer to buy the good or service but which is
independent of the quantity that the buyer actually purchases; and 2) a price or usage fee
charged for each unit the consumer actually buys. Many clubs use such two-part pricing.
They charge a flat annual fee for membership in the club (which is sometimes differentiated
by age or some other member characteristic), and additional per-unit fees to use particular
facilities or buy particular goods or services. Country clubs, athletic clubs, and discount
shopping clubs are all good examples of organizations that use this kind of pricing. A
related example of two-part pricing is that used by theme parks under which a flat fee is
charged to enter the park and additional fees (sometimes set to zero) are charged on a per
ride or per amusement basis. [1]

To see how two-part pricing can work to achieve first-degree price discrimination, let us
consider a ski resort in Colorado owned and operated by a local monopolist. Assume that
the resort’s clients are of two types, old and young. A typical old client’s inverse demand
curve to use the resort’s ski lifts is:


_P_ _VO_ _QO_ (6.1)
=  
while from each young client has the inverse demand curve:


_P_ _VY_ _QY_ (6.2)
=  


![](/Users/nicholasvreugdenhil/ASU Dropbox/Nicholas Vreugdenhil/masters_io_2026/external/peppall_textbook_chunks/markdown/peppall_textbook_chunk06_p126-150_images/peppall_textbook_chunk06_p126-150.pdf-8-2.png)





1 Versions of such a scheme are used, for example, at parks such as Disney World. See Oi (1971) for the
seminal discussion. As Ekelund (1970) notes, much modern analysis was anticipated by the work of 19 [th]

century French economist and engineer, Jules Dupuit. Varian (1989) provides an extensive survey of the
price discrimination strategies discussed in this chapter.


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Nonlinear Pricing 123


where Qi is the number of ski lift rides bought by a client of type _i_ (O or Y), P is the price
per lift ride and _Vi_ is the maximum amount a client of type Qi will pay for just one lift ride.
We assume that young clients are willing to pay more for a given number of lift rides than
are old clients, i.e., _VO < VY_ . After all, they are younger and probably fitter. We further
assume that the ski resort owner incurs a marginal cost of c dollars per lift ride taken plus
a fixed cost F of operating the resort each day. That is, the daily total cost function for the
resort is:


_C(Q)_ = _F_ + _cQ_ (6.3)

where _Q_ is the number of lift rides sold and taken.

This example is illustrated in Figure 6.1. The demand curve for a typical skier starts at _Vi_
and declines with slope −1 until it hits the quantity axis. The constant marginal cost curve
is a horizontal line through the value _c_ .

We assume that the ski resort owner can identify the true type of each skier, perhaps by
checking their IDs, and can prevent arbitrage, perhaps by selling the different types of skier
ski lift rides of different colors. Suppose first that the owner employs third-degree price
discrimination. Entry to the resort is free, the resort owner sets a price per ski lift ride to
each type of skier, and the skiers decide how many lift rides to buy at that price.

We simply apply the principles that we developed in Chapter 5. The resort owner
maximizes profit using the usual two-stage process. First equate marginal revenue with
marginal cost for each type of skier to identify the quantity of lift rides that the owner
wants to sell to each type of skier. Second, identify the prices that can be charged for these
quantities from the demand functions in equation (6.1) and equation (6.2).

Using the standard “twice as steep” rule, we know from equations (6.1) and (6.2) that the
relevant marginal revenues are:


Young : _MRY_ _VY_ 2 _QY_
=      
Old : _MRO_ _VO_ 2 _QO_ (6.4)
=      
Setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost _c_ the profit-maximizing output—number
of lift rides—to be sold to each type of skier is:

Young : _MRY_ = _VY_  - 2 _QY_ = _c_ ⇒ _QY_ = _[V][Y]_ [ −] 2 _[c]_

Old : _MRO_ = _VO_   - 2 _QO_ = _c_ ⇒ _QO_ = _[V][O]_ [ −] 2 _[c]_ (6.5)

Substituting these quantities into the demand functions gives the profit-maximizing price
per lift ride for each type of skier:




[ −] _[c]_ _[V][Y]_ [ +] _[ c]_

2 = 2



Young : _PY_ = _VY_ - _[V][Y]_ [ −] 2 _[c]_

[ −] _[c]_ _[V][O]_ [ +] _[ c]_

2 = 2



Old : _PO_ = _VO_ - _[V][O]_ [ −] 2 _[c]_



(6.6)

124 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Because by assumption _Vo < VY_ we have the result, as we found in Chapter 5, that the
high-demand group—in this case the young skiers—pay more per unit than the low-demand
group—the older skiers. Profit from each type of skier with this pricing policy is:



Young : _πY_ = _(PY_ - _c)QY_ = _[(][V][Y]_ [ −] 4 _[c][)]_ [2]



4



Old : _πO_ = _(PO_ - _c)QO_ = _[(][V][O]_ [ −] 4 _[c][)]_ [2]



(6.7)
4



These are the areas _bdhi_ and _fgjk_, respectively, in Figure 6.1.

For example, if _Vo_ is $12, _VY_ is $16, and _c_ is $4, then the optimal prices per ski lift ride
are $10 to each young skier and $8 to each old skier. Young skiers each buy six lift rides
and old skiers each buy four lift rides. Under this strategy, the resort owner earns a profit of
_(_ $10 − $4 _)_ [∗] 6 = $36 from each young skier and _(_ $8 − $4 _)_ [∗] 4 = $16 from each old skier. If
there were 100 old and 100 young skiers per day, the ski resort owner would earn a profit
of $5,200 each day less any fixed costs _F_ that are incurred.

To see that the ski resort owner can improve on this outcome, first note that at the prices
given by equation (6.6) every client of the ski resort enjoys some consumer surplus. Each
young skier has consumer surplus given by the triangle _abd_ in Figure 6.1(a) and each old
skier has consumer surplus given by area _efg_ in Figure 6.1(b). These areas are, by standard
geometric techniques:




[1] _[(][V][Y]_ [ −] _[c][)]_ [2]

2 _[(][Q][Y]_ _[)]_ [2][ =] 8



Young : _CSY_ = _(VY_ - _PY_ _)QY_ = [1] 2




[1] _[(][V][O]_ [ −] _[c][)]_ [2]

2 _[(][Q][O][)]_ [2][ =] 8



Old : _CSO_ = _(VO_ - _PO)QO_ = [1] 2



8



(6.8)
8



In our numerical example, each young client has consumer surplus of $18 and each old
client has consumer surplus of $8. This is a measure of the surplus that the resort owner has
failed to extract. The owner will clearly prefer any pricing scheme that appropriates at least
some, or even better, all of this surplus.

One possibility is for the resort owner to switch to a nonlinear pricing scheme that has
two parts—a cover charge that allows skiers to enter the resort and an additional charge
for every lift ride bought. This pricing design is often referred to as a two-part tariff. Each

**Figure 6.1** No price discrimination
Not price discriminating leaves both types of consumers with consumer surplus that the monopolist would like to
convert to profit.

old skier is charged an entry fee _EO_ = _[(][V][O]_ [ −] 8 _[c][)]_ [2]



entry fee of _EY_ = _[(][V][Y]_ [ −] 8 _[c][)]_ [2]



, whereas each young skier is charged an
8



entry fee of _EY_ = 8 . The entry fee is the first, fixed part of the two-part tariff. The

second part is the price per lift ride to each type of skier, which is either _PO_ or _PY_ . In our
numerical example, each old skier is charged an entry fee of $8 and each young skier is
charged an entry fee of $18. Lift rides are sold at $8 each to the old skiers and $10 each to
the young skiers. Checking IDs on entry to the resort and when using the ski lifts solves
both arbitrage and identification problems. [2] Moreover, the skiers will still be willing to
patronize the resort. Paying the entry fee reduces their surplus to zero but does not make it
negative. The surplus is a measure of their willingness to pay. Finally, because the entry fee
is independent of the number of lift rides each skier actually buys, each customer will also
continue to buy the same number of lift rides as before. Because the entry fee is equal to the
consumer surplus each skier previously enjoyed under the discriminatory but linear pricing
policy, the immediate effect of this two-part tariff is to extract the entire consumer surplus
and to convert it into profit for the resort owner. This implies a profit increase of _EO_ per old
skier and _EY_ per young skier. Again, in our example, this represents a profit increase of $8
per old skier and $18 per young one.

While the entry fees and unit prices we have calculated certainly increase the resort
owner’s profit, they are far from the best that the resort owner can do. By _reducing_ the
price of a lift ride the resort owner increases the potential consumer surplus each skier has.
This permits the resort owner to increase the entry fees to extract this additional surplus,
further increasing profit. The profit-maximizing two-part pricing scheme is illustrated in
Figure 6.2. It has the following properties [3] :


1. Set the price per unit (per lift ride) equal to marginal cost _c_ .
2. Set the entry fee for each type of client equal to that client’s consumer surplus at the
price given by 1.


In our ski resort example, the price per lift ride is set at _c_ no matter the type of skier.
The areas of the triangles _abd_ and _efg_ describe the consumer surplus at this price for



young skiers and for old skiers, respectively. These areas are _CSO_ = [1] 2



_CSY_ = [1] 2



2 _[(][V][O]_ [ −] _[c][)]_ [2][ and]



_CSY_ = 2 _[(][V][Y]_ [ −] _[c][)]_ [2][. As a result, the ski resort owner can now increase the entry fee to] _[ CS][O]_

for old skiers and _CSY_ for young skiers.

Under this optimal pricing scheme, the profit per lift ride from each skier is zero, because
lift rides are sold at cost. This pricing strategy has the advantage of encouraging the skiers
to purchase many lift rides, thereby yielding more consumer surplus. In turn, the resort
owner can appropriate that surplus by imposing the optimal entry fee. The funds generated
by the entry fees _are_ profit, indeed, they are the resort owner’s only source of profit in our


2 We assume that the cost of falsifying IDs and make-up to age a skier is more than the surplus young skiers
lose by paying the higher price.
3 To see why these properties hold, denote the fixed portion of the two-part tariff for a particular type of
consumer as _T_ and the user charge as _p_ . Express the demand curve for this type of consumer in inverse
form, _p_ = _D(q)_ and assume that the firm’s total cost function is _C(q)_ . The monopolist’s problem is to
choose the production level for this type of consumer,� _q_ _q_ [∗], implying a price _p_ [∗] = _D(q_ [∗] _)_, that maximizes

profits, _�(q)_, where _�(q)_ is given by: _�(q)_ =

_D(x)dx_ - _C(q)_ . Standard calculus then reveals that



maximizing this profit always requires setting a price or user charge equal to marginal cost, and a fixed
charge _T_ equal to the consumer surplus generated at that price.

where _nO_ is the number of old skiers and _nY_ is the number of young skiers per day.

In our example, the price per lift ride is set at $4. Old skiers purchase eight rides and
young skiers twelve rides. The entry fee, and profit per old skier, is now $32 while the
entry fee and profit per young skier is $72. This is a considerable increase over the $36 and
$16 profit earned without any fixed fee or even the $54 and $24 earned with the “wrong”
two-part tariff. This is a hefty profit increase. [4]

While the increase in profit is sizable and important, the two-part tariff has had another
result that is equally significant. Note that each client is now buying the quantity of lift
rides, _VO_ _c_ for the typical old client and _VY_ _c_ for the typical young one, that each
would have bought if the lift rides had been priced competitively at marginal cost. The − ability to practice first-degree price discrimination leads the monopolist to expand output

maximized—and that total surplus is claimed entirely by the monopolist.


of a typical consumer at the park. There are no fixed costs. The marginal cost associated
with each ride is constant. It is comprised of two parts, each also a constant. There is the cost
per ride of labor and equipment, k, and there is the cost per ride of printing and collecting
tickets, c. A management consultant has suggested two alternative pricing policies for the
park. Policy A: Charge a fixed admission fee, T, and a fee per ride of r. Policy B: Simply
charge a fixed admission fee, say T’, and a zero fee per ride.


4 It is also easy to show that the ski resort owner’s profit would be smaller than that achieved by the two-part
tariff if a uniform, linear pricing policy were adopted. We leave you to show this for yourselves.

6.1.2 Block Pricing


There is a second nonlinear pricing strategy by which the ski resort owner can achieve the
same level of profit. This scheme is block pricing. Using this type of pricing a seller _bundles_
the quantity that he or she is willing to sell with the total charge wished to be set for that
quantity. In our ski resort example, the owner sets a pricing policy of the form “Entry plus
X ski lift rides for Y dollars.” In order to earn maximum profit and appropriate all potential
consumer surplus, two simple rules determine the optimal block-pricing strategy:


1. Set the number of ski lift rides offered to each consumer type equal to the amount that
type of consumer would buy at competitive pricing, that is, the quantity bought at a
price equal to marginal cost;
2. Set a fixed charge for each consumer type at the total willingness to pay for the quantity
identified in (1).


Let’s examine how this would work in our ski resort example. Applying rule 1, we know
that each young client would buy _VY_ _c_ lift rides and each old client would buy _VO_ _c_
lift rides if the lift rides were priced at marginal cost. The total willingness to pay for these − quantities by young and old clients respectively is the area under the relevant demand curve
at these quantities. These are:



Young : _WTPY_ = [1] 2

Applying rule 2, we then have the following pricing policy. Offer each old client entry

entry plus _VY_ - _c_ lift rides for a total charge of [1] 2

entry plus _VY_ - _c_ 2 _[(][V]_ _Y_ [2] [−] _[c]_ [2] _[)]_ [ dollars.]

How would we implement this strategy in our ski resort example? One way would be
to ID each client at entry to the resort, then offer each young client a package of “Entry

plus a block of _VY_ - _c_ lift rides for a total charge of 2 [1]

client a package of “Entry plus a block of _VO_ - _c_ lift rides for a total charge of 2 _[(][V]_ _O_ [2] [−] _[c]_ [2] _[)]_

dollars.” Profit from a customer of type _i_ is the charge _WTPi_ minus the cost of the rides,



_c(Vi_ - _c)_, or 2 [1]




[1] [1]

exactly as in the two-part pricing system.

In our example, this amounts to offering each young skier a package of “Entry plus
twelve ski lift rides for $120” and each old skier a package of “Entry plus eight ski lift rides
for $64.” Profit from each young skier package is $120 − 48 = $72 and from each old skier
package is $64 − 32 = $32 as in the two-part pricing strategy.

Before leaving this section, we can point out a further interesting feature of the two
types of first-degree price discrimination that we have discussed. Both the two-part tariff
and the block pricing schemes result in the ski resort owner selling each old client entry

young client pays an average price per lift ride of [1]



2 _[(][V][O]_ [ +] _[ c][)]_ [. Similarly, each]

equation (6.6) that these are exactly the same prices per lift ride that would be levied if the
ski resort owner were to apply third-degree price discrimination. Yet the profit outcome is
different.

The reason that first-degree and third-degree price discrimination lead to very different
profits, despite the fact that the average price is the same in each case, lies in the very
different nature of the two pricing schemes. [5] Recall that each point on a demand function
measures the marginal benefit that a consumer obtains from consuming that unit. The
quantity demanded equates marginal benefit with the marginal cost to the consumer of
buying the last unit where, of course, marginal cost to the consumer is just the price for
that last unit. With third-degree price discrimination, or linear pricing, the price paid for the
last unit (indeed, every unit) is greater than marginal cost, which is how the resort owner
makes profit with this pricing scheme. More importantly, while the price charged for the
last lift ride sold under third degree price discrimination is equal to its marginal benefit,
the price charged for every other lift ride sold is less than its marginal benefit: there is
money (willingness to pay) “left on the table.” By contrast, with the nonlinear two-part
pricing scheme the ski resort owner sets the unit price of a lift ride to marginal cost, greatly
increasing the owner’s sales of ski rides. This creates consumer surplus, but the fixed charge


5 That average prices are the exactly same under the two pricing schemes is, of course, a result of our
assumption that demand functions are linear. But this does not alter the fact that first-degree price
discrimination is much more profitable than third-degree price discrimination or no price discrimination.


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Nonlinear Pricing 129


converts this consumer surplus into profit: there is no money “left on the table.” With block
pricing a buyer is not offered a price per unit. Rather, quantity and total charge are bundled
in a package of “X units for a total charge of Y dollars,” with the package being designed
to extract the total willingness to pay for the X units. Again, there is no money “left on the
table.”


6.2 SECOND-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION OR
MENU PRICING


First-degree price discrimination, or personalized pricing, is possible for the ski resort
owner for two reasons. First, the resort’s different types of customers are distinguishable
by means of a simple, observable characteristic. Secondly, the resort owner has the ability
to deny access to those not paying the entry charge designed for them. Not all services
can be marketed in this way. For example, if instead of a ski resort the monopoly seller is
a refreshment stand located in a campus center then limiting access by means of a cover
charge is not feasible.

Even in the ski resort case, first-degree discrimination by means of a two-part tariff is not
possible if the difference in consumer willingness to pay is attributable to some characteristic
that the resort owner cannot observe. For example, suppose that what differentiates highdemand and low-demand clients is not age but income. In our numerical example, the ski
resort will now find that any attempt to implement the first-degree price discrimination
scheme of charging high-income patrons an entry fee of $72 and low-income patrons an
entry fee of $32 is not likely to succeed. Every client would claim to have low income in
order to pay the lower entry charge and there is no obvious (or legal) method by which the
resort owner can enforce the higher fee.

What about the block pricing strategy of offering entry plus twelve ski lift rides for $120
and entry plus eight ski lift rides for $64? Will that work? Again, the answer is no. It is
easy to show that high income clients are willing to pay up to $96 for entry plus eight ski
lift rides. Thus they derive $32 of consumer surplus from the (eight rides, $64) package but
no consumer surplus from the (twelve rides, $120) package. They will prefer to pretend to
be low income in order to pay the lower charge and enjoy some surplus rather than confess
to being high income, even though this means that they get fewer lift rides.

The monopolist could, of course, decide to limit entry only to high-income clients by
setting the entry charge at $72 or offering only the (twelve rides, $120) package but
this loses business (and profit) from low-income clients. Suppose, for instance, that there
are _NO_ low-income clients and _NY_ high-income clients. The profit from selling to only
the high-income clients is $72 _NY_ . Setting the lower entry fee or offering only the (eight
rides, $64) package in order to attract both types of client gives profit of $32 _(NY_ _NO)_ .
Clearly, the latter strategy is more profitable if 32 _NO >_ 40 _NY_ . In other words, if the ratio +
of low-income to high-income clients _(NO/NY_ _)_ is more than 1.25:1 (the per skier profit
difference divided by profit per young skier) the policy of setting the higher entry fee or
offering only the (twelve rides, $120) package generates less profit than offering just the
lower entry fee or the (eight rides, $64) package to all customers.

The point is that once we reduce either the seller’s ability to identify different types
of buyers or to prevent arbitrage among them (or both), complete surplus extraction by
means of perfect price discrimination is no longer possible. Both the two-part and block
pricing mechanisms can still be used to raise profit above that earned by linear pricing but


130 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


they cannot earn as much as they did previously. Solving the identification and arbitrage
problem has now become costly. It is still possible that the monopolist can design a pricing
scheme that will induce customers to reveal who they are and keep them separated by their
purchases, but the only way to do this incurs some cost—a cost reflected in less surplus
extraction. Such a pricing scheme is called second-degree price discrimination, or menu
pricing.

Second-degree price discrimination is most usually implemented by offering quantity
discounts targeted to different consumer types. To see how it works, let’s continue with
our ski resort example illustrated in Figure 6.4 for the numerical example. Again, the highhave (inverse) demanddemand customers have (inverse) demand _Pl_ 12 _Ql_ . Now, however, the ski resort owner has no means _Ph_ = 16 − _Qh_ and the low-demand customers
of distinguishing who is who because the source of the difference between consumers is = inherently unobservable. All the owner knows is that two such different types of consumer
exist and they both wish to frequent the ski resort.

Any attempt to implement a differentiated two-part tariff will not work in this case. Both
types of customer will claim to be low-demand types when entering the resort in order to
pay the lower entry fee of $32. Only _after_ they are in the resort will the different consumers
reveal who they are. Because the price per ski lift ride is set at marginal cost of $4, the
high-demand customers will buy twelve rides and reveal themselves to be high demanders
whereas the low-demand customers will buy eight rides and reveal themselves as such.

You might be tempted to think that the resort owner could implement first-degree price
discrimination using the following strategy. When entering the resort, skiers are allowed to
purchase some defined maximum number of ski lift rides. If they pay an entry charge of $32
they will be allowed to purchase up to eight ski lift rides, while if they pay $72 they will
be allowed to purchase up to twelve rides. Yet this approach will not work either, and for
the same reason that the block pricing strategy of offering (twelve rides, $120) and (eight
rides, $64) packages failed. High-demand customers again have every reason to pretend to
be low-demand customers and pay an entry charge of only $32, thereby buying eight ski lift
rides at $4 each for a total expenditure of $64. Because, as can be seen from Figure 6.4(a),
their total willingness to pay for the eight ski lift rides is $96, high-demand consumers
will enjoy a surplus of $32 from this deception. By contrast, they will enjoy no surplus if
they pay the entry charge of $72 and buy twelve rides because their total expenditure will
be then $120, which exactly equals their willingness to pay for twelve ski lift rides. As a
result, it remains the case that the high-demand customers are better off by pretending to be
low-demand even though this constrains the number of ski lift rides that they can buy.

While unsuccessful, the idea of offering different entry and lift ride combinations as
different packages does contain the hint of a strategy that the ski resort owner can use to
increase profit. The point is to employ a variant on the _block pricing_ strategy described
earlier. The difference is that, because there is no easy way to identify and separate the
different types of customers, the block pricing strategy itself must be designed to achieve
this purpose. This imposes a new constraint or cost on the resort owner and so will not yield
as much profit as first-degree price discrimination. However, it will substantially improve
on simply offering all customers a ($64, eight lift rides) package that yields a profit of $32
from each.

To see how one might use block pricing to achieve the identification and separation
necessary for price discrimination let us start with the low-demand customers. The ski
resort owner knows that these customers are willing to pay a total of $64 for eight lift
rides. In other words, the resort owner can offer a package of entry plus eight lift rides at

**Figure 6.4** Second-degree price discrimination
Low demand customers are willing to pay $64 for entry plus 8 drinks. High demand customers are willing to pay
up to $96 for entry plus 8 drinks, and so get $32 surplus from the 8-drinks, $64-package. They will therefore be
willing to buy a 12-drinks, $88-package, which also gives them a $32 surplus.


a price of $64 for the package. This package will be attractive to low-demand customers,
effectively extracting the $32 surplus from each of them. The problem is that high-demand
customers will also be willing to buy this package because their willingness to pay for
entry and eight lift rides is $96. While the resort owner also gets $32 in profit from the
high-demand customers buying this package, those customers themselves still enjoy a
surplus of $96 − $64 = $32.

The resort owner’s optimal strategy at this point is to offer a second package targeted to
high-demand consumers. The owner knows that the high-demand customers are willing to
pay a total of $120 for entry plus twelve lift rides. Yet the owner also knows that he cannot
charge $120 for twelve lift rides because the high-demand customers will not be willing to
pay this much, given that they can buy the (eight rides, $64) package and enjoy a consumer
surplus of $32. For an alternative package to be attractive to high-demand consumers it has
to be what economists call _incentive compatible_ with the (eight rides, $64) package. This
means that any alternative package must also allow the high-demand customers to enjoy a
surplus of at least $32.

A package that meets this requirement but that also generates some additional profit for
the club owner is a package of entry plus twelve lift rides for a total charge of $88. We
know that the high-demand customers value entry plus twelve lift rides at $120. By offering
this deal at a price of $88, the resort owner permits these customers to get $32 of surplus
when they buy this package, just enough to get them to switch from the (eight rides, $64)
package. [6] And while the high-demand consumers get a $32 surplus on this package, the


6 We are working in round numbers to keep things neat. What the ski resort owner might actually do is price
the package of entry plus twelve lift rides at $87.99 to ensure that the high-demand customers will strictly
prefer this to the (eight rides, $64) package.

resort owner’s profit is also higher than it is on the (eight rides, $64) package. On the latter,
the owner earns $32, but on the new package, the owner earns $88 − _(_ $4 × 12 _)_ = $40. Of
course, the low-demand customers will not buy the (twelve rides, $88) package because
their maximum willingness to pay for twelve lift rides is only $72. Nevertheless, the resort
owner still earns $32 from these consumers by continuing to sell them the (eight rides, $64)
package. So, the resort owner’s total profit is increased.

The two menu options have been carefully designed to solve the identification and
arbitrage problems by inducing the customers themselves to reveal who they are through
the purchases they make. The resort owner now offers a menu of options, entry and eight
lift rides for $64 or entry and twelve lift rides for $88, designed to separate out the different
types of customers served. For this reason, this strategy is often referred to as _menu pricing_ .
It has one very important feature. Note that as before, the average price per lift ride of the
(eight rides, $64) package is $8. However, the average price per lift ride of the (twelve
rides, $88) package is $7.33. The second package thus offers a _quantity discount_ relative to
the first.

Quantity discounts are common. Movie theaters, restaurants, concert halls, sports teams,
and supermarkets all make use of them. It is cheaper to buy one huge container of popcorn
than many small ones. Wine sold by the glass is more expensive per unit than wine sold
by the bottle. A 24-pack of Coca-Cola is cheaper than twenty-four individual bottles. It
is cheaper per game to buy a season’s subscription to your favorite football team’s home
games than to buy passes to each individual game. As we have just seen, a full-day pass at
a ski resort will reflect a lower price per run than will a half-day lift ride. In these and many
other cases, the sellers are using a quantity discount to woo the high-demand consumers.

There is another twist to consider. What if the ski resort owner now decides to offer a lower
number of lift rides, say seven, in the package designed for the low-demand customers?
The maximum willingness to pay for entry plus seven lift rides by a low-demand customer
is $59.50, so this new package will be (seven rides, $59.50). The profit it generates from
each customer is $31.50, which is 50 cents less than the (eight rides, $64) package. But now
consider the high-demand customers. Their maximum willingness to pay for seven rides is
$87.50, so buying this new package gives them consumer surplus of $28. As a result, the
ski resort owner can increase the price of the twelve lift-ride package. Rather than pricing
it so that it gives the high-demand customers $32 of consumer surplus, the owner can now
price it so that it gives them only $28 of surplus. In other words, the price of the second
package (entry plus 12 lift rides) can now be raised to $120 − 28 = $92, increasing the
owner’s profit from each such package to $44.

The example illustrates the importance of the incentive compatibility constraint. Any
package designed to attract low-demand customers constrains the ability of the monopolist
to extract surplus from high-demand customers. Again, this is because the high-demand
customers cannot be prevented from buying the package designed for low-demand customers, and thus will always enjoy some consumer surplus from doing so. As a result,
the monopolist will find it more profitable to reduce the number of units offered to lowdemand customers because this will allow the price charges for the package targeted to
the high-demand customers to be increased. There may even be circumstances in which
the monopolist would prefer to push this logic to the extreme and not serve low-demand
customers at all because of the constraint serving them imposes on the prices that can be
charged to other customers.


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Nonlinear Pricing 133


Whether or not the monopolist has an incentive to serve the low-demand consumers
will depend on the number of low-demand consumers relative to high-demand ones. The
fewer low-demand consumers there are relative to high-demand ones, the less desirable
it is to serve low-demand consumers because any effort to do so imposes an incentive
compatibility constraint on the extraction of surplus from high-demand ones.

When we extend our analysis to a more general case with more than two types of
consumers the profit-maximizing second-degree price discrimination, or menu pricing,
scheme will exhibit some key features. In particular, if consumer willingness to pay can
be unambiguously ranked by type then any optimal second-degree price discrimination
scheme will:


1. Extract the entire consumer surplus of the lowest demand type served but leave some
consumer surplus for all other types;
2. Contain a quantity that is less than the socially optimal quantity for all consumer types
other than the highest-demand type;
3. Exhibit quantity discounting.


Second-degree discrimination enhances the ability of the monopolist to convert consumer
surplus into profit, but does so less effectively than first-degree discrimination. With no
costless way to distinguish the different types of consumers, the monopolist must rely
on some sort of block pricing scheme to solve the identification and arbitrage problems.
However, the incentive compatibility constraints that such a scheme must satisfy restrict
the firm’s ability to extract all of the consumer surplus. Instead, the firm is forced to make
a compromise between setting a high charge that loses sales to low-demand buyers, and a
low charge that foregoes the significant surplus that can be earned from the high-demand
buyers. And contrary to what many consumers may think, the lower price charged for a
larger quantity is entirely unrelated to scale economies. If in our example the ski resort
owner has no fixed costs there are no economies of scale. Nevertheless, the owner finds it
profitable to offer a quantity discount to high-demand customers.

6.3 SOCIAL WELFARE WITH FIRST- AND SECOND-DEGREE
PRICE DISCRIMINATION


One way to understand the welfare effects of price discrimination is to consider a particular
consumer group _i_ . Suppose each consumer in this group has inverse demand:


_P_ _Pi(Q)_ (6.11)
=

Assume also that the monopolist has constant marginal costs of _c_ per unit. Now let the
quantity that each consumer in group _i_ is offered with a particular pricing policy be _Qi_ .
Then the total surplus—consumer surplus plus profit—generated for each consumer under
this pricing policy is just the area between the inverse demand function and the marginal
cost function up to the quantity _Qi_, as illustrated in Figure 6.5.

The pricing policy chosen by the firm affects the quantity offered to each type of
consumer, and it alters the distribution of total surplus between profit and consumer surplus.
The first effect has an impact on welfare, whereas the second effect does not imply a change
in total welfare, but rather a transfer of surplus between consumers and producers. As a
result, _price discrimination increases (decreases) the social welfare of consumer group_ i _if_
_it increases (decreases) the quantity offered to that group_ .

**Figure 6.5** Total surplus
When the total quantity consumed is _Qi_ total surplus is given by the shaded area. Total surplus is maximized at
quantity _Qi(c)_ .


It follows immediately that first-degree price discrimination always increases social
welfare even though it extracts all consumer surplus. With this pricing policy we have seen
that the monopoly seller supplies each consumer group with the socially efficient quantity
(the quantity that would be chosen if price were set to marginal cost). Hence first-degree
discrimination always increases the total quantity to a level [ _Qi(c)_ in Figure 6.5] that
exceeds that which would have been sold under uniform pricing.

With second-degree price discrimination matters are not so straightforward. As we have
seen, this type of price discrimination leads to high-demand groups being supplied with
quantities “near to” the socially efficient level. However, we have also seen that the seller
will want to restrict the quantity supplied to lower-demand groups and, in some cases, not
supply these groups at all. The net effect on output is therefore not clear a priori.

The impact on social welfare of second-degree price discrimination can nevertheless be
derived using much the same techniques that we used in Chapter 5. By way of illustration,
suppose that there are two consumer groups with demands as illustrated in Figure 6.6 (i.e.,
Group 2 is the high-demand group). In this figure, _P_ _[U]_ is the nondiscriminatory uniform
price, and _Q_ _[U]_ [and] _[ Q][U]_ [are the quantities sold to each consumer in the relevant group]




_[U]_ 1 [and] _[ Q]_ 2 _[U]_

price, and _Q_ _[U]_ 1 [and] _[ Q]_ 2 _[U]_ [are the quantities sold to each consumer in the relevant group]

at this price. By contrast, _Q_ _[s]_ [and] _[ Q][s]_ [are the quantities supplied to the two groups with]



at this price. By contrast, _Q_ _[s]_ 1 [and] _[ Q]_ 2 _[s]_ [are the quantities supplied to the two groups with]

second-degree price discrimination. [7] We define the terms:



_�Q_ 1 _Q_ _[s]_
=




_[s]_ 1 1

[−] _[Q][U]_




_[U]_ 1 _�Q_ 2 _Q_ _[s]_

[;] =




_[s]_ 2 1

[−] _[Q][U]_




_[U]_ 1 (6.12)



In the case illustrated we have _�Q_ 1 _<_ 0 and _�Q_ 2 _>_ 0. This tells us that an upper limit
on the increase in total surplus that follows from second-degree price discrimination is the
area G minus the area L. This gives us the equation:


_�W_ _G_ _L_ _(PU_ _MC)�Q_ 1 _(PU_ _MC)�Q_ 2 _(PU_ _MC)(�Q_ 1 _�Q_ 2 _)_
≤   - =   - +   - =   - +

condition for second-degree price discrimination to increase welfare is that it increases total
output when compared to uniform pricing.

We know from the previous chapter that this requirement is generally not met in the case of
third-degree price discrimination and linear demands because then the monopolist supplies
the same total quantity as with uniform pricing, so third-degree price discrimination does not
increase welfare. By contrast, it could be the case that second-degree price discrimination
leads to an increase in the quantity supplied to both markets and this would increase social
welfare. In the ski resort owner’s case, for example, this will be the case if there are equal
number of high-demand and low-demand customers. (You are asked to show this in the
end-of-chapter problem 7.)


6.4 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: PRICE DISCRIMINATION AND
MONOPOLY VERSUS IMPERFECT COMPETITION


We have set our discussion of price discrimination in both the current and previous chapter
in the framework of a monopolized market. Yet as students frequently point out, many
of the discriminatory practices we describe are observed in markets that are far from
monopolies such as airlines, restaurants, hotels, and even theme parks. Of course, in each
of these cases, the firms employing price discrimination tactics have to have some degree
of market power even though they do confront rival sellers. Perfectly competitive firms by


Price Discrimination and Monopoly: Nonlinear Pricing 137


definition must take the market price as given and therefore cannot manipulate that price in
any way or extract any additional surplus. Imperfectly competitive firms, though, do have
discriminatory power. Moreover, it turns out that it is precisely in a setting of imperfect
competition that there is additional pressure for firms to price discriminate beyond the
surplus extraction consideration that motivates a pure monopolist.

When firms are imperfect rivals, the nature of that competition will often result in
discriminatory prices as part of their competitive strategy. This point, first emphasized by
Borenstein (1985), can be illustrated with a simple example. Consider a monopolist who
owns the only two surfboard shops in Minnesota—one in Minneapolis and the other in
St. Paul. The proximity of the two towns is such that transport costs are not a factor for
any consumer in choosing which store to patronize. The 2 _N_ potential customers are evenly
distributed between the two towns and each is willing to pay as much as _V_ for a surfboard.
However, while consumers are alike in their willingness to pay, they are different in one
other respect. Half of the consumers are inexplicably loyal to their town’s shop. That is,
one-fourth of the consumers will always buy from the Minneapolis store and one-fourth
will always buy from the St. Paul store so long as the price is less than _V_, and without regard
to the price at the other shop. The remaining _N_ consumers are just the opposite. While
willing to pay as much as _V_, these consumers always shop wherever the price is lowest.

A little economic reasoning should convince you that our hypothetical monopolist will
set a price of _V_ at both shops and serve all the 2 _N_ customers. Clearly the price cannot be
higher than this or no customer will buy the product. However, there is no need to reduce
the price. The first set of consumers will not consider the price at any location other than
their local store. The second group will look for a lower price but, because the price is _V_
at each shop, this group also splits evenly between the two stores. The monopolist would
then make a total profit of 2 _(V_ - _c)N_ divided evenly between the two stores. No amount of
price discrimination can increase this value.

Now consider what would happen if the two stores are instead owned by two different
firms, firm 1 and firm 2. Each store has _N/_ 2 customers who are totally locked-in to that
shop and who the store would like to charge _V_ . There may, however, be competition for
the second group of consumers who care about price. If firm 1 in Minneapolis charges
_V_ to this group, firm 2 in St. Paul can attract all their patronage by charging a price $1
lower, i.e., by charging _V_ - 1. In response, the Minneapolis store might lower its price to
_V_ - 2, which would induce further cuts in St. Paul and so on. Ultimately, then, competition
for the _N_ price-conscious consumers pushes prices closer to marginal cost at both stores.
The question is whether each store can somehow prevent this competition from spilling
over to its locked-in consumers. The answer of course is that, yes, firm 1 and firm 2 can
each continue to charge their intensely loyal customers a high price provided two familiar
conditions are met. These are the identification and no-arbitrage conditions we derived
in Chapter 5. If the non—price-sensitive consumers can be identified and separated in a
meaningful way from the price-conscious ones, then each store can continue to charge these
consumers _V_ for a surfboard while selling at price _c_ to everyone else.

It is important to emphasize that it is competition—imperfect as it is—that leads
to the differential pricing strategy. Again, had the market been monopolized, no price
discrimination would have emerged. The price would have been _V_ to all consumers. This
is what we mean when we say that imperfectly competitive markets create an additional
force evoking discriminatory prices. Price discrimination permits competing actively for
those consumers who perceive alternatives to the firm’s product while still charging a high
price to those that do not. In our example, there is only one other store, so the pricing is
bifurcated. Some customers pay _V_ while others pay _c_ . We might expect that if there had


138 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


instead been three or four stores, there might be fewer locked-in consumers as some might
regard another Minneapolis or another St. Paul store an acceptable substitute. In this case,
we might see more and more complicated price breaks.

The foregoing intuition lies at the heart of the paper by Stavins (2001), which examines
the influence of competition on the use of discriminatory pricing in the airline industry. For
this purpose, she looked at price and other information for 5,804 rides over twelve different
routes on a specific Thursday in September, 1995. Selecting a single day is useful because
it eliminates any price differentials due to flying on other days of the week, especially
weekend days. A September choice also avoids both peak summer and winter demand
periods. The key characteristics that Stavins (2001) looks at are: 1) whether a Saturday
night stay-over was required and 2) whether a 14-day advance purchase was required.

As discussed in Chapter 5, each of these restrictions serves as a means for airlines to
identify and separate customers based on how they value their time and their need for
flexibility. Prices for rides requiring a Saturday night stay-over or that had to be purchased
14 days prior to departure should sell for less than other rides. The hypothesis to be tested
is that the price discount on these restricted rides gets bigger the more competition there is
on the route. Stavins (2001) constructs a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index _HI_ for each route to
serve as a rough measure of that market’s competitive pressure.

To test this hypothesis, Stavins (2001) runs two sets of regressions. The first of these serves
to confirm that ride restrictions do indeed translate into discriminatory price differentials. It
takes the basic form:


_pijk_ _β_ 0 _β_ 1 _Rijk_ _β_ 2 _HIi_ _β_ 3 _Sij_ _β_ 4 _Firstijk_ _β_ 5 _Daysijk_ _β_ 6 _Zi_ _εijk_ (6.15)
= + + + + + + +

Here, _pijk_ is the (log of the) price of the _k_ th ride sold by airline _j_ in city-pair market _i_ .
_Rijk_ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if there was a restriction on the flight (Saturday night
stay-over or pre-purchase requirement) and 0 otherwise. _HIi_ is the Herfindahl-Hirschman
Index for the _i_ th market. _Sij_ is the market share of airline _i_ in market _j_ . _Firstijk_ is a dummy
variable equal to 1 if the ride was for first-class fare and 0 otherwise. _Daysijk_ is the number
of days prior to departure that the fare for that ride was last offered. _Zi_ is a vector of
other market _i_ characteristics such as average income and population. The error term _εijk_ is
assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0.

If ride restrictions serve as a means of implementing price discrimination then the
coefficient _β_ 1 on _Rijk_ should be negative. This would imply that passengers flying the same
flight on the same airline paid lower prices if they accepted a requirement that they stay
over Saturday night or that they purchase the ride in advance.

However, simply finding that _β_ 1 is negative only shows that price discrimination occurs.
It does not tell us if there is any connection between the extent of such discrimination
and the degree of competition in the market. To test this hypothesis, Stavins (2001) runs
regressions of the basic form:


_pijk_ _β_ 0 _β_ 1 _Rijk_ _β_ 2 _HIi_ _β_ 3 _(HIi_ _xRijk)_ _β_ 4 _Sij_
= + + + +

_β_ 5 _Firstijk_ _β_ 6 _Daysijk_ _β_ 7 _zi_ _εijk_ (6.16)
+ + + +

This is exactly the same as the previous regression except that it now includes the interactive
term ( _HIixRijk_ ), the product of the concentration index and the restricted travel variables.
