564 Non-Price Competition


Research is, of course, costly. Indeed, not only is it costly, but we assume that R&D
activity exhibits _dis_ economies of scale, i.e., it becomes more costly the more research the
firm does. Specifically, we assume that research costs are the same for both firms and given
by the research cost function

_r(xi)_ _[x]_ _i_ [2] _i_ 1,2 _._ (20.10)
= 2 _[,]_ =

Thus, if the R&D intensity is _xi_ 10, then the research budget _r(xi)_ 10 [2] _/_ 2 $50.
If the R&D intensity doubles to _xi_ = 20, the budgetary expense climbs to 20 = [2] _/_ 2 = $400.
A doubling of R&D effort therefore leads to a quadrupling of the R&D cost. This is an = =
example of what we mean by a scale diseconomy.


20.5.1 Noncooperative R&D: Profit, Prices, and Social Welfare


Consider first what happens when firms do not cooperate on research. Suppose that we
have a two-stage game and in the first stage, each firm chooses its research intensity _xi_ . In
the second stage, each firm acts as a Cournot competitor in choosing its output. As usual,
this game is solved backwards. Again, from Chapter 9 we know the Cournot equilibrium
outputs for given values of _c_ 1 and _c_ 2 are



1 _[C]_ _[(A]_ [ −] [2] _[c]_ [1][ +] _[ c]_ [2] _[)]_

Equation (20.13) indicates that the output of each firm is an increasing function of its
own R&D expenditures _xi_ . Such expenditures reduce a firm’s costs and thereby make
higher output more profitable. By contrast, the effect of the _rival’s_ R&D effort on a firm’s
production can go either way. Consider firm 1. On the one hand, the R&D activity of firm
2 spills over and lowers firm 1’s costs, which has an expansionary effect on firm 1’s own
output. On the other hand, firm 2’s R&D reduces firm 2’s cost. This makes firm 2 more
competitive and permits it to expand its output leaving less market available to firm 1. The
net result of these two countervailing forces is ambiguous. This ambiguity is reflected in
the coefficient on _x_ 2 in the _q_ 1 equation and the coefficient of _x_ 1 in the _q_ 2 equation. In both
cases, this coefficient, 2 _β_ - 1, is positive only when the degree of spillover is large, that is,
when _β >_ 0.5. When spillovers are small, that is, when _β <_ 0.5, a firm’s output and profit
are decreasing functions of the R&D expenditures of its rival. The same ambiguity appears
in the profit equations (20.14).

We know that each firm will choose the level of research activity that maximizes its
profit given the research effort of its rival. For every choice of effort that firm 2 makes, firm
1 will choose its own profit-maximizing response. The same is true for firm 2 in reverse.
So we can in principle identify the best response or _research intensity reaction function_ for
each firm.

This is done in the Appendix to this chapter, allowing us to specify the research intensity
reaction functions as follows:



_R_ 1 : _x_ 1 [2] _[(]_ [2][ −] _[β)]_ [[] _[A]_ [ −] _[c]_ [ +] _[ x]_ [2] _[(]_ [2] _[β]_ [ −] [1] _[)]_ []]

_[β)]_ [[] _[A]_ [ −] _[c]_ [ +] _[ x]_ [2] _[(]_ [2] _[β]_ [ −] [1] _[)]_ []] and _R_ 2 : _x_ 2 [2] _[(]_ [2][ −] _[β)]_ [[] _[A]_ [ −] _[c]_ [ +] _[ x]_ [1] _[(]_ [2] _[β]_ [ −] [1] _[)]_ []]

[9 _B_ 2 _(_ 2 _β)_ [2] ] = [9 _B_ 2 _(_ 2 _β)_ [2] ]
  -  -  -  



[9 _B_ - 2 _(_ 2 − _β)_ [2] ]



(20.15)



Inspection of these functions confirms an intuitive result that follows from our previous
discussion. When research spillovers are low, the research intensity reaction functions for
the two firms are downward sloping, indicating that the research expenditures of the two
firms are _strategic substitutes_ —more research by one firm reduces the amount done by the
other. That is, research activity by one firm substitutes for research activity by the other.
The intuition is that in this case the increased research effort by one firm primarily reduces
its costs and so gives it a competitive advantage with respect to the other rival firm. In turn,
this results in a reduction in the profitability of the rival firm, which can be offset only by
the rival reducing its expenditure on research.

By contrast, when spillovers are high, the research intensity reaction functions are upward
sloping, meaning that the research expenditures of the two firms are _strategic complements_ .
When spillovers are this high, an increase in research intensity by one of the firms induces
an increase in research intensity by the other. In this case the intuition is that if one firm
opts for a high level of R&D effort, the benefits of that activity spill over to the other firm
to such an extent that the other firm’s profit increases, providing that firm with the funds
and the incentive to increase its own R&D spending. Figure 20.4 illustrates typical research
intensity reaction functions.

However, determining whether the reaction functions slope downward or upward—
whether the two firms’ R&D efforts are strategic substitutes or complements—does not tell
us what the equilibrium level of R&D spending is. In particular, there can be no presumption
that the presence of large R&D spillovers and hence the case of strategic complements will

result in a higher equilibrium level of R&D spending than the case in which such spillovers
are low. The Nash equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the two response functions, and
the case in which this point is farthest from the origin is far from obvious.

In order to illustrate this last point, we focus for the remainder of our discussion on a
numeric example. The Appendix gives a more general mathematical analysis. Let demand
for the good be _P_ = 100 − 2 _Q_, and each firm’s marginal production cost currently be $60.
The firms can choose two levels of research intensity: _xi_ 10 or _xi_ 7.5. Further, we
assume that the degree of research spillover (which is outside the control of the two firms) = =
takes one of two values: a low value of _β_ = 1 _/_ 4 or a high value of _β_ = 3 _/_ 4.

Consider first the low-spillover case and assume that firm 2 chooses the high research
intensity of _x_ 2 10. If firm 1 also chooses high research intensity, its output and profits
will be, from equations (20.13) and (20.14) =

The same calculations apply to firm 2. We then have the payoff matrix of Table 20.3(a).
_The Nash equilibrium in this case of low spillovers is for both firms to adopt high research_
_intensities_ .

When the degree of R&D spillover is high, with _β_ = 0.75, the same calculations lead to
the payoff matrix of Table 20.3(b). _The Nash equilibrium in this case is for both firms to_
_adopt low research intensities_ .

An increase in the degree of R&D spillover causes the two firms to reduce their research
intensities. Why? Consider first the case in which R&D spillovers are weak. In this case the
more firm 1 spends on R&D, the less firm 2 will spend because the primary effect of such
spending is to strengthen the competitive position of firm 1. Yet somewhat paradoxically,
this gives each firm an incentive to spend aggressively on R&D so as to avoid being the
loser in this competition. If firm 1 spends a lot on R&D and firm 2 spends nothing, virtually
all the benefits of firm 1’s spending stay with firm 1. Firm 2 would find itself losing
significant market share and profit to a much lower-cost competitor. When each firm tries
to avoid falling behind in this manner, the net result can be a substantial amount of R&D
effort, both at each firm and in total.

Just the opposite holds in the case of large spillovers. Yes, the more firm 1 spends on
R&D, the more firm 2 is induced to spend by virtue of the strategic-complements setting,
but this relation is a two-edged sword. Even if firm 1 spends only a little on R&D it knows
that this will still induce firm 2 to do a fair bit of research activity. Moreover, the research
activity at firm 2 will bring substantial benefits to firm 1 by virtue of the large spillovers. In
this setting, the incentive for either firm to spend much on R&D can be quite small as each
firm seeks to free ride on the other’s efforts.

Where graphs fail to give clear results, algebra can often save the day. That this is true
here is shown in the Appendix. The Nash equilibrium level of research intensity is:

The amount of research done by each firm _decreases_ as _β_, the degree of R&D spillover,
increases—the free-riding effect to which we have just referred.


568 Non-Price Competition


20.5.2 Technology Cooperation


We now consider two other possible arrangements between the duopoly firms that can alter
the outcome from that described above. The first possibility is that the two firms agree
that while each will continue to do its own R&D, they will coordinate the extent of such
research effort. Thus, the two firms now choose _x_ 1 and _x_ 2 to maximize their joint profit.
They continue to recognize that they will compete as Cournot firms in the product market.
The other possibility we consider is that the firms explicitly share their R&D activities by
setting up a Research Joint Venture (RJV). One way this scenario might work in practice
would be for the two firms to jointly set up a laboratory for experimentation and analysis
with all the discoveries made at that laboratory to be made fully available to both firms.

We introduce this RJV arrangement into the model by letting the two firms pick _x_ 1 and _x_ 2
cooperatively but by adding the further assumption that the degree of spillover is complete,
that is, _β_ = 1. Whatever is learned in the research lab—whether discovered by a firm 1
scientist or a firm 2 scientist—reduces the cost of both firms by the same amount.

We start with the simple coordination case. What we want to do is to pick the values
of _x_ 1 and _x_ 2 that maximize the sum of the individual profit expressions shown in equation
(20.14). The mathematical solution, as in the previous section, is developed in the Appendix
to this chapter. The equilibrium research intensity is:



_x_ _[RC]_



1 _[RC]_ _x_ 2 _[RC]_
=



2 _[RC]_ [2] _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)(]_ [1][ +] _[ β)]_
= 9 _B_ 2 _(_ 1 _β)_ [2]



(20.17)
9 _B_ - 2 _(_ 1 + _β)_ [2]



We shall concentrate once again on our simplified example as given by the payoff
matrices of Tables 20.3(a) and 20.3(b). When the firms coordinate their research efforts
they choose the combination of R&D intensities that maximizes the sum of the profits
in the cells of the relevant payoff matrix. _When R&D spillovers are low, coordination_
_leads each of the firms to choose the low R&D intensity_ . Cooperation then increases each
firm’s profits from $103.13 to $107.31. By contrast, _when the R&D spillover is high,_
_coordination leads each firm to choose the high R&D intensity_, increasing their profits from
$128.67 to $133.68.

What our example and the more detailed analysis in the Appendix show is the following.
First, it is now the case that the higher is the level of R&D spillover—the larger is _β_ —the
more each firm spends on research: this follows directly from equation (20.17). This is
because the agreement between the two firms to set their R&D efforts jointly explicitly
forces each firm to internalize the external benefits that such spending has upon its rival.
In turn, this eliminates the free-riding problem that characterizes R&D competition when
there are high spillovers. The ability to avoid this problem also means that the two firms
will each enjoy a profit at least as great as that which they would have earned in the absence
of such cooperation. [16]

The second point to note is that the outcome under the simple coordination plan may not
necessarily be good for the consumer. In particular, consumers are hurt by the technology
cooperation when _β <_ 0.5 and the extent of spillover is small. The reason is straightforward.
When _β_ is small, then without cooperation each firm tends to do a fair bit of research. It
does so because a low value of _β_ means that most of the benefit from its innovative efforts
will accrue to it alone and because it knows that its rival is proceeding along the same line of


16 For _β_ = 0.5 each firm earns exactly the same profit under uncoordinated R&D spending as each does
with an R&D cartel. For all other values of _β_ each firm’s profit is higher with the R&D cartel.


Research and Development 569


attack. From the viewpoint of consumers, this is great because there has been considerable
cost reduction and therefore a sharp decline in the price they pay. If, in this setting, we
now introduce a cooperative R&D agreement, the two firms realize that their best bet is to
reduce R&D intensity, which otherwise simply makes competition tougher in the product
market. By decreasing R&D intensity, the firms increase their profits. Unfortunately, the
lower rate of innovation also implies a higher price to consumers.

By contrast, when the degree of R&D spillover is high ( _β >_ 0.5), both firms and
consumers benefit from a cooperative R&D agreement. This happens because now the
primary effect of the R&D cooperation is to correct a market failure. In the absence of
cooperation, a large degree of spillover leads each firm to free ride on the R&D efforts of its
rivals and to take no account of the beneficial effects its own R&D expenditures have on the
costs and profits of other firms. R&D cooperation internalizes these effects because it forces
the cooperating firms to look at the impact their R&D expenditures have on aggregate profit
rather than merely on their individual profit.

What about a research joint venture? As noted, an RJV can be best thought of as a case
in which the firms take actions not only to coordinate their research expenditures but also
to ensure that the spillover from one firm’s research to the other’s is complete, that is, so
that _β_ = 1. A little thought should convince you that an RJV will likely yield the maximum
benefits to both firms and consumers. As we just saw, coordination of R&D levels benefits
both producers and consumers whenever _β >_ 0.5. Moreover, the profit outcomes in Tables
20.3 indicate that if the firms could find some way of increasing the technology spillover
from _β_ = 0.25 to _β_ = 0.75, they would both benefit at _any_ research intensity. We can make
this discussion even more general. In the Appendix we show that an increase in the spillover
parameter _β_ increases the research intensity and the profits of each firm _and_ increases the
output that each firm brings to the market. In other words, _both firms and consumers benefit_
from an increase in _β_ . The RJV takes this to its logical conclusion by ensuring that _β_ = 1,
its highest possible value. The equilibrium research intensity with _β_ = 1 is:



_x_ _[RJV]_



1 _[RJV]_ _x_ 2 _[RJV]_
=



2 _[RJV]_ [4] _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_
= 9 _B_ 8



(20.18)
9 _B_ - 8



The RJV gives higher profits _and_ lower prices than any other arrangement.



In our example, the benefits of an RJV are easily confirmed. Consider the case in which
both firms choose the high degree of research intensity. Thus, with perfect R&D spillover,
the profits to each firm are _(_ 40 + 10 + 10 _)_ [2] _/_ 18 − 50 = $150, while if each chooses the
low research intensity, the profits to each firm will be _(_ 40 + 7.5 + 7.5 _)_ [2] _/_ 18 − 56.25 _/_ 2 =
$139.93. Clearly, the RJV will go for the high research intensity leading to the lowest costs.
In turn, this will translate into the lowest consumer prices that these Cournot firms will offer.

The intuition behind the foregoing analysis is as follows. First, by maximizing the extent
of spillovers, the RJV also maximizes the benefits of R&D. Every discovery is spread
instantly to all firms in the industry. Second, despite this perfect spillover, the free-riding
problem is now avoided. Because the two firms have agreed to coordinate their research
efforts they fully internalize the otherwise external effects of research. Thus, firms will
pursue extensive research, which, partly because of the perfect spillover effect of sharing,
will lead to a sizable reduction in costs for every firm. This substantial cost reduction
translates into an equally impressive reduction in the price to consumers. [17] The policy


17 While we have derived this result for a duopoly, Kamien et al. (1992) show that it extends to an _n_ -firm
oligopoly.


570 Non-Price Competition


implication of this is obvious and important. Research joint ventures should be encouraged
because they benefit both consumers and producers so long as the antitrust authorities
can ensure that such cooperation on research effort does not also extend to cooperation in
production and prices, that is, to a price-fixing cartel.

The potentially large benefit from technology cooperation is undoubtedly the reason
that research joint ventures—unlike price-fixing agreements—are not treated as _per se_
violations by the antitrust authorities. Instead, they are evaluated on a rule of reason basis.
Indeed, the US Congress passed legislation in 1984 to require explicitly the application of
a reasonability standard in the specific case of RJVs.


20.6 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: R&D SPILLOVERS IN PRACTICE


R&D spillovers suggest a diffusion-like process. The greater the spillover, the more rapid or
the more complete is the diffusion of technological advances in one firm to the productivity
of other firms. We might also suspect that a similar process is at work at a national and
even international level. In particular, it seems likely that the R&D efforts of one country
could spill over to enhance the productivity of its neighbors. Here again, the extent of such
spillover is of interest. If technical advances in one country spread quickly to others, _β_ will
be high. In a world in which the international transfer of technical knowledge is weak, _β_
will be low.

Wolfgang Keller (2002) explores the extent of international technical spillover by looking
at data covering twelve broadly defined manufacturing industries from fourteen countries
over the years, 1970–95. To understand his basic approach, consider a simple Cobb-Douglas
production function (see Section 4.5) for industry _i_ in country _c_ .



_Qci_ _Kci_ [1][−] _[σ]_
=



_ci_ [−] _[σ]_ _L_ _[σ]_




_[σ]_ _ci_ (20.19)



Here _Qci_ is output (value added) and _Kci_ and _Lci_ are capital and labor inputs, respectively,
in industry _i_ in country _c_ and _σ_ is the share of costs accounted for by labor. Taking
logarithms then yields:


ln _Qci_ _(_ 1 _σ)_ ln _Kci_ _σ_ ln _Lci_ (20.20)
=    - +

For industry _i_, we defne ln _Qci_ to be the average log of output across all countries. Similarly,
for industry _i_, let ln _K_ _ci_, and ln _Lci_ be the average amount of capital and labor inputs (again
in logs), respectively, across all countries. If we define total factor productivity, _TFPci_,
in industry _i_ and country _c_ as the difference between the log of output and the weighted
average level of inputs, i.e., _TFPci_ ln _Qci_ _(_ 1 _σ)_ n _Kci_ _σ_ ln _Lci_, then the _relative_ (to
the mean) factor productivity _Fci_ of industry = - _i_ in country − _c_ at a point in time is: +


_Fci_ _(_ ln _Qci_ ln _Qci)_ _(_ 1 _σci)(_ ln _Kci_ ln _K_ _ci)_ _σci(_ ln _Lci_ ln _Lci)_ (20.21)
=   -   -   -   -   -   
where we now let the cost share of labor _σci_ vary across countries and industries.
Equation (20.21) is a measure of the extent to which output in industry _i_ in country _c_
remains above average even after correcting for any above average use of inputs. It is thus
a measure of the productivity advantage (or disadvantage) in industry _i_ in country _c_ at any
point in time. This is why it is called _relative_ productivity. Of course, this will probably


Research and Development 571


change over time due to R&D and other factors. For this reason, Keller (2002) measures
relative productivity for each year from 1970 to 1995. This means that for each of the
twelve industries in each of the fourteen countries, Keller (2002) has a measure of relative
productivity in each year, 1970 to 1995. Because we are now measuring this term over
time as well as over industries and across countries, relative factor productivity now has
an additional time subscript, i.e., _Fcit_ . It is this series of relative productivity measures that
Keller seeks to explain.

Because, by construction, variations in the relative productivity measure _Fcit_ reflect
variations in factors other than capital and labor inputs, it is natural to identify these
remaining differences as those due to differences in technology. In turn, these technical
differences ought to reflect differences in R&D. Keller’s (2002) approach in this respect is
to distinguish between R&D done domestically in industry _i_ and that done abroad. The first
research question is whether foreign R&D spills over to domestic productivity. The second
is whether these spillovers are greater for countries that are closer to each other.

The fourteen countries in Keller’s (2002) sample are: Australia, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. Five of these countries—France, Germany, Japan,
the United Kingdom, and the United States—account for over 92 percent of all the R&D
in the sample. Hence, Keller (2002) treats these G5 countries as the potential engines of
technical change and examines how their R&D affects productivity in the remaining nine.
Specifically, he estimates the parameters of the following equation:



⎛

⎝ [�]

_g_ ∈ _G_ 5



⎤


⎦ _εcit_ (20.22)
+



⎞


⎠



_Fcit_ _αci_ _αt_ _λ_ ln
= + +



⎡


⎣ _Scit_ _γ_
+



_Sgite_ [−] _[δD][cg]_



Here, _Fcit_ is the relative productivity measure derived above for industry _i_ in country _c_
in year _t_, measured for each of the nine countries examined. The first term is a country
and industry specific constant that permits for a time-independent productivity advantage
or disadvantage for that sector in that country. The second is meant to pick up productivity
increases over time that affect all firms in all countries in common. The key parameters are
embedded in the next term. _Scit_ is a measure of the R&D done in industry _i_ in country _c_
up to time _t_ . In contrast, _Sgit_ is a measure of R&D in that same industry but in one of the
G5 countries and _Dcg_ is the distance of that country from the domestic country in question.
( _D_ = 1 implies a distance of 235 kilometers.) Together, _Scit_ and the summation term for
the G5 countries are meant to capture the R&D relevant to productivity in the domestic
industry _i_ at time _t_ .

The effect of that combined industry-based R&D on productivity in that same industry in
the domestic country is captured by the parameter _λ_ . However, two adjustments are included
to distinguish the impact of foreign R&D from that of domestic R&D. To understand the
first of these adjustments suppose that all G5 countries were right next to the domestic
country in question ( _Dcg_ 0). Then the contribution of their R&D on domestic productivity
in industry _i_ to total industry-relevant R&D is adjusted by the parameter = _γ_ (taken to be same
for all G5 countries). That is, if _γ <_ 1, foreign R&D contributes less than the full effect
of domestic R&D in adding to the knowledge relevant to a particular domestic industry’s
productivity. In many ways then, _γ_ is comparable to the _β_ of our industry analysis above.
However, Keller (2002) also introduces a second source of distinction between domestic
and foreign research lies in the distance term, _Dcg_ . As this distance grows, the contribution


572 Non-Price Competition


of that G5 country’s R&D to domestic productivity diminishes further if the parameter _δ_
is positive. In short, the specification permits both for the possibility that simply by being
foreign R&D may contribute less to domestic technology than home-grown research, and
also for the more complicated fact that spillovers from foreign R&D grow smaller as the
source of that R&D is farther away. Of course, the error term _εcit_ picks up any remaining
random factors that affect productivity.

The specification in equation (20.22) assumes that the decay parameter _δ_ is the same
throughout the time period. Keller (2002) recognizes, however, that increased globalization
over the twenty-five years of his sample suggests that _δ_ will decline over this period. He
therefore estimates an alternative specification given by:






_g_ ∈ _G_ 5







_Sgite_ [−] _[δ(]_ [1][+] _[ψ][D]_ _[I][t]_ _[)D][cg]_



⎤


⎦ _εcit_ (20.23)
+



_Fcit_ _αci_ _αt_ _λ_ ln
= + +



⎡


⎣ _Scit_
+



_γG_





1 _ψF_ _It_
+



In this equation, _It_ is a 1,0 dummy variable equal to zero over the first half of the sample
to 1982 and then 1 in the thirteen years thereafter. The coefficient _ψF_ permits the effect
of G5 R&D to have a different effect on domestic productivity in the second half of the
sample than it does in the first, holding the distance between the domestic and G5 countries
constant. Similarly, the coefficient _ψD_ permits the extent to which spillovers decline with
distance to change from the first half of the sample to the second half. Note too that this
specification allows the effect of G5 R&D to differ across each G5 country by permitting a
different coefficient _γG_ for each one. This is reasonable as the different languages in these
countries may affect the ease with which a technology can be transferred.

Because the contribution of foreign R&D to the total relevant measure of R&D depends
on the parameters _γ (_ or _γG)_ and _δ_ that are also to be estimated, equations (20.22) and
(20.23) cannot be estimated by ordinary least squares. Instead, a nonlinear least squares
estimation is required. In this procedure, we begin with a starting value for the nonlinear
parameters and then estimate the regression with OLS. We may then use these estimates
to reiterate the process until the coefficient estimates stop changing and converge to stable
values. Table 20.4 shows the key parameter estimates and their standard errors that Keller
(2002) obtains from this maximum likelihood process for both specifications.

The estimates in Specification 1 suggest that technical spillovers are strongly localized.
The cumulative productivity effect of overall R&D is to raise productivity by 7.8 percent.
However, foreign (G5) R&D contributes only 84 percent to the technical base that domestic
research does and that is only if the domestic country is right next to the G5 source nation
so that _D_ = 0. The estimate of _δ_ = 1.05 though, indicates that that contribution dies out
rapidly. Half of it is gone when _D_ = 0.69 or at a distance of 162 kilometers (100 miles),
and the rest is virtually eliminated once the source country of the foreign R&D is more than
400 miles away.

However, the results from Specification 2 qualify the foregoing findings. It is useful to
first note that the estimate of _ψF_ is insignificantly different from zero. Hence, correcting
for distance and country of origin, the contribution of a G5 country’s R&D on domestic
technical know-how is pretty much the same throughout the sample years and, on average,
not too different from the 84 percent found in Specification 1 when the distance to the G5
country is _D_ = 0. The real change comes in the extent to which the impact of G5 R&D
declines with distance. Now the estimate of _δ_ is a much smaller 0.384, indicating that the
effect declines much more slowly with distance, even in the first half of the sample when
_I_ that this small rate of decline is even smaller from 1983 to 1995 than it was previously. _t_ = 0. Over the latter half, though, when _It_ is 1, the estimate of _ψD_ = −0.784 indicates
Together, these estimates indicate that at least half of the effect that a G5 nation’s R&D
would have had if the domestic country had been right next to it ( _D_ = 0) is still there as
far out as 424 kilometers (263 miles) from 1970 to 1982, and is felt as far out as 1,963
kilometers (1,217 miles) after 1983. This implies a larger and growing degree of technical
spillovers between industries in different nations.

Because Keller’s spillover estimates apply to whole sectors separated by national
boundaries there may well be a lower bound for the extent of such spillovers between firms
within the same domestic industry. If this is so, then these empirical estimates when taken
together with our analysis of the noncooperative outcome with high spillovers suggest that
the market will likely be characterized by inefficiently low R&D. If that is the case, then the
argument for permitting R&D cooperation and/or joint ventures becomes noticeably more
compelling.


**Summary**



Research and development is the wellspring of
technical advancement. Such advancement is the
key source of the gain in per capita income
and living standards that has characterized the
developed economies for almost all of the past
200 years. Firms often compete by investing in
R&D projects in the hope of uncovering costsaving innovations and new consumer products.
Such competition in R&D raises the question
as to whether the market will yield efficient
R&D outcomes. It also raises a potential tension
between allocative efficiency at a point in time
and dynamic efficiency over time.

The tension between the gains from competition and the gains from innovation, i.e.,
the tension between the replacement effect



and the efficiency effect is unavoidable. It
has led economists to consider which market
environment—competitive or monopolistic—
will foster greater research and development.
The Schumpeterian hypothesis is, broadly speaking, that oligopolistic market structures are best
in this regard.

Both theory and empirical data give ambiguous evidence as to the market structure most
conducive to R&D effort. Competitive markets
can sometimes fail to be as innovative as their
less-competitive counterparts but a surprising
number of key inventions have come from small
firms. Policy has a role to play here, too. One role
for policy is to encourage cooperation in research
efforts. Empirical evidence suggests that we live


574 Non-Price Competition


in an increasingly interconnected world in which
the benefits from one firm’s R&D spill over to
other firms including, in particular, its rivals.
In such a world, the noncooperative outcome is
likely to be one with too little R&D effort. Policy that fosters research cooperation among firms
can be helpful in this setting. Yet caution is also
necessary. The trick is somehow to foster cooperation on R&D without simultaneously inducing
collaboration on prices and product design.


**Problems**


1. Assume that inverse demand is given by
the linear function _P_ = _A_    - _BQ_ and that
current marginal costs of production are _c_ .
a. By how much would an innovation
have to reduce marginal cost for it to
be a drastic innovation?
b. Use your answer to derive a condition on the parameters _A, B_, and _C_ that
determines whether a drastic innovation is feasible. (Hint: costs cannot be
negative.)


For Problems 2 through 5 assume the following:
Inverse demand is given by _P_ = 240 − _Q_ . The
discount factor is 0.9. Marginal production costs
are initially $120:


2. Calculate the market equilibrium price, output, and profits (if any) on the assumption
that the market is currently
a. monopolized;
b. a Bertrand duopoly;
c. a Cournot duopoly.


3. Suppose that a research institute develops a
new technology that reduces marginal costs
to $60.
a. Confirm that this is not a drastic innovation in either the Bertrand or Cournot
cases.
b. Calculate the new market equilibrium
price, output, and profits for the monopolist and each duopolist, given that in
the duopoly case the innovation is made
available to only one firm.

c. How much will the monopolist and
duopolist each be willing to pay for the
innovation?



A similar tension arises in the role of patent
policy. Patents can enhance the incentives for
firms to pursue technological innovations. Yet,
by temporarily granting monopoly power, patents
can also weaken competitive forces and reduce
consumers’ access to those breakthroughs. We
consider patents and related policy issues in the
next chapter.


4. Now assume that there is a potential entrant
in the monopolized case and that the
research institute is considering offering
the innovation to this firm as well as to
the monopolist. How does this affect the
amount that the incumbent monopolist will
be willing to pay for the innovation?


5. Now return to the duopoly case but assume
that the research institute is considering
whether it should actually sell the innovation to both firms. Will it wish to do so
a. in the Bertrand duopoly?
b. in the Cournot duopoly?


6. Assume that annual inverse demand for
a particular product is _P_ = 150 − _Q_ . The
product is offered by a pair of Bertrand
competitors, each with marginal costs of
$75. The discount factor is 0.9. What
is the current equilibrium price and total
surplus?


7. Return to Problem 6. Assume now though
that if R&D is conducted at rate _x_, it incurs
one-off costs of _r(x)_ = 10 _x_ [2] and reduces
marginal costs to _(_ 75 − _x)_ . Suppose that
one firm decides to conduct R&D at rate
_x_ = 10. This research will be protected by
a patent of _T_ years.
a. What profit (ignoring the one-off costs
of R&D) does the innovating firm make
each year during the period of patent
protection?
b. What is the new equilibrium price
and total surplus once patent protection
expires?


8. Use your answers to 7(a) and 7(b) to write
the total net surplus from the innovation as


a function of the period of patent protection. Use a spreadsheet program to derive
an approximation to the socially optimal
period of patent protection.


9. How are your answers to 7(a) and (b)
affected if the innovating firm conducts
research at rate _x_ = 15?

# **21** **Patents and Patent Policy**

In 1769, an English inventor, Richard Arkwright, patented a spinning frame that would
revolutionize the production of cotton cloth. Two years later, in 1771, Englishman James
Hargreaves introduced another invention, the spinning jenny. With these inventions, Britain
entered the Industrial Revolution. Equally important, the inventions allowed Arkwright
and Hargreaves to establish a commanding position in the production of cloths and, more
generally, textile products. This allowed the inventors to reap large profits and to sell at a
high price in the American colonies even after these became independent states.

The British energetically protected their monopoly position. Westbound ships out of
London were searched thoroughly to make sure that no passenger was a former Arkwright
or Hargeaves employee or had a copy of the design plans for the Arkwright–Hargreaves
machines that firms outside of Britain might copy. Such restrictions along with the high
textile price for British textiles vexed many Americans. Consumers did not like paying the
monopoly prices and firms were eager to get some version of the machines that would permit
them to compete with the British producers. Some firms offered “bounties” for English
apprentices who would be able to obtain the necessary information. Finally, in 1789, an
enterprising young Englishman and former Arkwright partner, Samuel Slater, responded
to just such a bounty offer. After completely memorizing the engineering details of the
Arkwright-Hargreaves machines, he disguised himself as a common laborer and set sail for
America. Shortly thereafter, Slater arrived in Pawtucket, Massachusetts and established the
first of many New England textile mills consolidating the region’s manufacturing base and
finally breaking the British monopoly.

The issues raised by Slater’s entrepreneurship (what some might call theft) lie at the
heart of this chapter. The central question is how strongly a firm’s innovation should be
protected from imitative competition. On the one hand, information about an innovation is
a public good so that once the information is produced, efficiency requires that access to
this information, i.e., new production techniques and new products, should be unrestricted
to prevent the rise of monopoly. On the other hand, if the government does not protect
innovators against imitation, there may be little incentive to do the hard work that led to the
invention in the first place.

The patent system was designed to create incentives for innovative activity. Patents and
copyrights confer ownership to new inventions, new designs, and new creative works. In
turn, those property rights permit innovators to restrict the use of their ideas just as the British
restricted the flow of information on their textile technology. The patent holder can act as

a monopolist regarding its discovery and earn a monopoly profit as a result. Yet while that
profit may create an incentive to undertake R&D efforts, the monopoly that generates the
profit reduces the total surplus below what it could be given that the invention has occurred.

Getting this balance right is not easy. We can imagine just how much less productive the
economy would be if the science behind electric lighting, the aerodynamics of airplanes,
and semiconductors had never been developed. Or how much less healthy we would be
without drugs to lower cholesterol and combat polio and malaria. However, society would
also be less productive and less healthy were those same technologies not now widely
available to all firms and consumers. At some point, policy must shift from a stance of
protecting innovators from imitation to one of permitting the use of the innovation on as
wide a basis as possible. The sixty-four-million-dollar question is, exactly where does that
point arise? When has protection of the innovator extended sufficiently far that we ought to
start thinking about protection of consumers?

The issue as to how far patent rights should extend has two dimensions. First, what is
the length of time for which any patent rights ought to last? Second, to what range of
products should the patent apply? Should the developer of a new AIDS treatment based on
a special combination of protease inhibitors be protected against a rival’s later development
of an alternative AIDS treatment based on a different combination of protease inhibitors?
What about a new AIDS treatment that is not based on protease inhibitors? Or what if a
protease inhibitor treatment originally created as a treatment for AIDS is now applied as a
treatment for multiple sclerosis? These issues—typically referred to as patent length and
patent breadth—are the central questions in patent policy.


21.1 OPTIMAL PATENT LENGTH


Current patent law establishes a patent duration that varies from country to country. In the
United Kingdom and the United States, patent law grants protection for twenty years from
the date of filing the application. In both countries it is up to the patent holder to ensure that
the patent is renewed during its life and to ensure that the patent is not infringed.

Economic theory can provide some insights as to whether that duration makes sense.
The key is to find a balance between the innovator’s ability to earn a return on its R&D
investment and the benefits that accrue to consumers once the patent expires and competition
emerges. The basic model, which is due to Nordhaus (1969), is presented below.

Imagine a competitive industry in which each firm is pursuing a nondrastic innovation.
Innovative efforts incur costs. Each firm’s unit operating cost is currently _c_ . If a firm invests
in R&D at some intensity _x,_ it expects to reduce its unit operating costs from _c_ to _c_ - _x_ .
The cost of undertaking R&D at intensity _x_ is _r(x)_ . We assume that such costs rise as the
level of research intensity increases and that they do so at an increasing rate. Formally, this
means that _dr(x)/dx >_ 0 and _d_ [2] _r(x)/dx_ [2] _>_ 0. Thus, R&D is expensive to do and exhibits
decreasing returns in that a doubling of research intensity will give less than double the
reduction in operating costs.

Our assumption of a competitive market implies that price equals marginal cost, which
means that the initial market price is _c_ and that the output level is _Q_ _[C]_ 0 [. This is shown in]

Figure 21.1. A successful innovator will be able either to produce at the lower unit cost of
_c_ - _x_ and drive out all its rivals by setting a price just one penny less than the current price,
or to license its discovery to its competitors for a fee of _c_ - _x_ per unit produced. Either
way, the current market price and volume of output remain unchanged. The innovator,

**Figure 21.1** Innovation gains during period of patent protection ( _T_ years) and after patent

The innovator receives profit of area _A_ for the _T_ years that the patent is in effect. When the patent expires,
competition lowers the price to _c_ - _x_ . Consumers gain the former profits _A_ and also area _B_ as consumer surplus.
However, only the area _B_ is a net increase in welfare.


however, earns a profit equal to area _A_ in Figure 21.1. Assuming that the life of the
innovator’s patent is _T_ years, this profit will last for _T_ years as well.

When the patent expires, all firms will have access to the technology for free. Competition
will reduce the price to _c_ - _x,_ and output will expand to _Q_ _[C]_ _T_ [. The profit that the innovator]



will reduce the price to _c_ - _x,_ and output will expand to _Q_ _[C]_ _T_ [. The profit that the innovator]

used to earn becomes consumer surplus. This is simply a transfer from a producer to
consumers and so does not reflect a net gain. However, the expansion of industry output
to the higher level _Q_ _[C]_ [does bring such a net benefit by virtue of the additional consumer]



to the higher level _Q_ _[C]_ _T_ [does bring such a net benefit by virtue of the additional consumer]

surplus this generates. This additional surplus is shown in Figure 21.1 as area _B._

The longer the duration of the patent (the higher is _T_ ), the longer is the time over which
the innovator earns the profit _A_ and the greater is the innovator’s incentive to do costly
R&D. Denote the per period profit flow to the innovator (area _A_ in Figure 21.1) as _π_ _[m]_ _(x_ ; _T )_
and the discount factor as _R_ . The present value of the innovator’s profit from R&D is [1]

Therefore, the R&D has a net value to the innovator of


_Vi(x_ _T )_ _r(x)_ (21.2)
;     
For a given value of _T_ chosen by the patent office, the innovator selects a level of R&D
activity, _x_ [∗] _(T ),_ that maximizes this expression. This choice just balances the marginal gain
of additional discounted profit against the marginal cost of doing more R&D work.

Of course, a rational patent office recognizes that its choice of patent life _T_ affects the
firm’s choice of R&D effort. We suppose that the patent office can work out this relationship
precisely. In other words, the patent office can determine the innovator’s profit-maximizing
research intensity, _x_ [∗] _(T ),_ as a function of _T_ . To choose _T_ optimally, the patent office


1 This result uses the following equation in calculating discounted value. Assume that a sum _A_ is to be
received each period for _T_ periods, and recall from Chapter 2 that _R_ = _(_ 1 + _r)_ [−][1] where _r_ is the interest
rate. Then the discounted value of these cash flows is _S_ = _A_ + _RA_ + _R_ [2] _A_ + _R_ [3] _A_ + _. . ._ + _R_ _[T]_ [ −][1] _A_ =

wishes to pick the patent duration that maximizes the net social gain to both consumers and
producers given how firms choose their research intensities. Let us denote by _cs(x_ ; _T ),_ the
per-period increase in social surplus that the innovation generates once it becomes freely
available, which as we have seen is the area _A_ + _B_ in Figure 21.1. The present value of this
increase in surplus is then

; = ; + ;        
and the objective of the patent office is to choose the patent duration _T_ [∗] that maximizes this
net surplus. This is a complicated expression but we can develop an intuitive argument to
support a very important proposition, namely, that _the optimal patent duration is finite_ .

To see why, note that as the patent office initially increases patent duration it induces
greater R&D effort and, at first, a greater discounted net surplus to producers and consumers.
If patent duration is zero, the returns to an innovator are also zero because the results of the
innovation will be imitated immediately. Accordingly, there is no R&D and no change in
the social surplus. If we now increase the patent length to a value _T >_ 0 _,_ we induce some
innovation and, thereby, some increase in the total surplus. Beyond some point, however,
continued increases in _T_ reduce net social surplus even though they lead to more R&D
and therefore greater reductions in production cost. Two forces work to limit the optimal
value of _T_ . The first is our assumption of diminishing returns to R&D activity. Because
it becomes progressively more expensive to lower production costs, it takes progressively
greater increases in _T_ to achieve a given additional cost saving. The second force limiting
optimal patent duration is the fact of discounting. The consumer benefits shown as area _B_
in Figure 21.1 are not realized until after the patent expires. If the patent office chooses a
very long duration time _T_ the present value of those benefits is very small indeed.

This is particularly important because it has sometimes been argued that innovation
should be granted patent protection forever. Such a long patent duration puts far too
heavy a value on the monopoly profits that patent protection generates and gives too
little consideration to the additional consumer surplus that emerges only after the patent
protection has expired. [2]

21.2 OPTIMAL PATENT BREADTH


The question of the optimal patent breadth is trickier than that of patent length, mainly
because there is no universally accepted measure of breadth comparable to time as a
measure of duration. Conceptually, the idea is to set a minimum amount by which a new
innovation must differ from an existing process (or good) in order for the new one either to
avoid infringement on an existing patent or to be itself patentable. The larger this required
minimal degree of difference, the more difficult it is for other firms to “invent around” the
patent and to cut into the inventor’s profit. We could in principle work out the optimal
patent breadth just as we worked out the optimal patent length. But the lack of a clear
method for measuring breadth makes implementing this plan very difficult.

This lack of precision is reflected in the language of the patent office. Each application
for a patent is required to specify all the “related” existing patents and to indicate not only
how the patent being applied for is a discovery distinct from those already patented, but
also to show that the discovery is “novel, nonobvious, useful.” Such language leaves the
patent office a lot of discretion regarding how it rules in any particular case.

What makes the question of the optimal patent breadth even more difficult is that it cannot
be divorced from the question of optimal duration. Patent policy must set both dimensions
of patent protection. Typically, this amounts to choosing between a system in which patents
should have a short duration but a broad coverage, the “short and fat” approach, or a long
duration combined with a very narrow coverage, the “long and thin” solution. As always,
these choices involve balancing the need to maintain the incentive to innovate against the
need to distribute the benefits of innovation as widely as possible.

The complications that arise when a second dimension of breadth is introduced into
patent policy can be seen in a number of formal models. Consider for instance the analysis
of Gilbert and Shapiro (1990). They define patent breadth in terms of the extent to which the
patent-holder can charge a price above marginal cost. Broader patents decrease consumer
substitute options and permit a higher price-cost margin. This margin of course is the source
of the patent-holder’s profit. Suppose that we know the desired innovative effort level _x,_
and hence the cost _r(x)_ necessary to achieve that effort. The trick then is to do this with a
patent design that produces the necessary (discounted) profit at the lowest possible social
cost. That is, we may frame the objective as choosing patent breadth and length so as to
minimize the deadweight loss per unit of innovator profit subject to that profit level being
sufficient to undertake the desired inventive activity.

Given the social objective and their definition of patent breadth, Gilbert and Shapiro
(1990) then demonstrate that the optimal patent is to have very narrow but infinitely long
patents. Why? The underlying intuition is as follows. If we think of time as a sequence
of equally long intervals, then each interval may be thought of as a separate market. A
standard condition for welfare maximization is that it should not be possible to raise welfare
by shifting production from one market to another, i.e., the net marginal value of an extra


Patents and Patent Policy 583


unit should be the same in each market or, in our case, in each period. A finite patent
does not typically satisfy this condition. During the patent life, the price is high due to the
patent-holder’s monopoly power. Once the patent has expired, however, the price falls to
marginal cost. The only way to avoid this discontinuity is to keep the price above marginal
cost in all markets, i.e., for all time periods into the infinite future, while limiting the
accompanying distortion that this brings by restricting the patent’s breadth so that price
is just enough above cost permanently that the necessary profit level is achieved. In other
words, optimal patent policy induces small but equal price distortion for many periods
rather that a few large distortions in some periods and none in others.

However, the Gilbert and Shapiro (1990) approach is not the only way to model patent
breadth. Klemperer (1990) for example offers an alternative approach that relates patent
breadth more directly to product differentiation. If we think of a Hotelling line segment of
finite length, Klemperer’s view is that a useful definition of patent breadth is the fraction of
the line segment that is covered by the patent. Again assuming that the goal is to minimize
the ratio of social cost to innovator profit subject to covering desired innovation costs,
Klemperer (1990) then shows that there are cases in which optimal patent design is just the
opposite of that implied by the Gilbert and Shapiro analysis. That is, it is often the case that
the best patent design is one of broad patents that are short-lived.

To understand Klemperer’s (1990) argument, consider a simple example. Suppose that
the new good costs nothing to produce (all the costs are sunk design costs) and that there are
ten potential customers for the product. Assume further that each customer values the good
at $10. If there were no other substitutes available, the monopolist firm would then simply
set a price of $10 _,_ sell one unit to each of the ten consumers, and claim all of the $100
surplus from the market. There would be no consumer surplus but also no welfare loss.
Total output would also have been ten had the monopolist priced at marginal cost _(_ = 0 _)._

Now suppose that the transport cost of buying an alternative legal substitute is different
for each of the ten consumers. Specifically, let one consumer incur a transport cost of $1
per unit of distance the substitute is from the product; a second incur a transport cost of $2
per unit; and so on. In this setting, patent breadth _w_ is interpreted as how far consumers
have to travel to obtain a legal alternative brand. A very wide breadth or high value for _w_
effectively puts one back in the setting of no alternatives. Hence, if _w_ is very broad, the
market outcome will again be a price of $10 _,_ and there will be no deadweight loss. Now,
however, consider what happens if we limit the patent width to _w_ = 1 (or just a bit less). In
this case, at any price _p_ ≥ $1 _,_ the patent holder loses some customers. At a price of $1 _,_
the patent holder loses one client. At a price of $2 _,_ a second is lost, so on. The best option
(assuming whole-dollar prices) is then to set a price of $5 _,_ in which case the patent holder
sells five units and earns profit of $25. Now there is a deadweight loss. Real resources
are being used to produce the less desired substitutes into which consumers are shifting.
Consumers are incurring transport costs, as well. In other words, the narrower is the patent
the greater is the deadweight loss, implying the need for broad patents. Patent length should
then be set at the minimum necessary to achieve the desired innovative expenditure.

As noted, Klemperer’s (1990) analysis also yields conditions under which a narrower but
longer-lived patent is preferred. This occurs for example when, unlike the case above, it is
the transport cost that is the same for all and the valuation that varies across consumers.
However, the crucial result is that when consumer variation primarily reflects differences
in transport cost or strength of preference for the brand of the new good and not in the basic
valuation of that good, broad patents of relatively short derivation are preferred.


584 Non-Price Competition


Gallini (1992) provides a further reason why short-lived broad patents may be best. She
makes the point that imitators can often get around patent protection if they spend enough
money to imitate the product without infringement. They will be particularly encouraged to
do so when patents are long because otherwise, entry into the market will be greatly delayed.
When patents are short, imitation is less attractive because firms now find it cheaper simply
to wait for the patent to expire than to engage in costly efforts to imitate legally now. In
other words, Gallini (1992, 2002) makes the important point that costly imitation efforts
also need to be accounted for in considering any welfare effects. If these imitation costs are
sizeable, then broad but short-lived patents are preferable.

Denicol`o (1996) synthesizes many of these features in a framework that also incorporates
the extent of market competition. He finds that “Loosely speaking, the less efficient is the
type of competition prevailing in the product market, the more likely it is that broad and
short patents are socially optimal” (264) . By “efficient,” Denicol`o means roughly the extent
to which competition drives firms close to the competitive ideal. Denicol`o’s statement
implies that markets in which firms have a greater degree of monopoly power will do best
with the “short and fat” approach, while markets characterized by a good bit of competition
will do best with patents that are “long and thin.”

As a policy recommendation, a major drawback of Denicol`o’s proposal is that it seems
to suggest applying different standards to different innovators depending on the structure
of the innovator’s basic industry. In reality, the rule of law cannot be applied so selectively
without risking serious inconsistency. Even apart from that consideration, there is a further
difficulty in implementing any of the proposed standards. The problem again is that it is not
always easy to make the concept of patent breadth operational. We do not have an easy way
to translate real markets into a spatial representation and no obvious measure of distance.
Indeed, as Scotchmer (2004) has noted, Klemperer’s (1990) horizontal concept of breadth
is itself too limiting. There is also a vertical component reflecting how much better (or how
much worse) a rival’s product has to be before it does not infringe on the patented good.
Recognizing this second dimension of patent breadth makes its measurement all the more
difficult from a practical perspective. While it is probably fair to say that we will not go
too far wrong if we adopt a one-size-fits-all policy of granting patents with “reasonable”
breadth but constrained length, precisely what this means in practice is a lot less clear.


21.3 PATENT RACES


Our discussion of market structure and innovative activity was largely motivated by
Schumpeter’s observation that innovation is a crucial and different kind of competition.
The Schumpeter vision is one in which firms vie with each other by racing to develop
new technologies or new goods and in which this sort of rivalry is potentially deadly for
those who come up short. This is particularly true when innovations are eligible for patent
protection. With patents, coming in first is all that matters whether one wins by several
lengths or by just a nose. The first firm to discover a cure for male baldness or to engineer
a successful system for producing “talking” pictures leaps far ahead of its rivals and stays
there for some time by virtue of patent or copyright protection. Patent awards have a
“winner-take-all” feature so that finishing second is no better than finishing third or fourth
or, for that matter, tenth.

Innovative competition can be regarded as a race in which one player’s success is the
other player’s serious defeat. The loser of a patent race may see years of investment and


Patents and Patent Policy 585


hard work wiped out overnight when the rival announces its breakthrough. We now turn
to some of the issues that arise when we consider the implications of a patent system that
generates races in which finishing first is all that matters. What are the consequences of
such races? Do they lead to inefficient investment in R&D? Does the innovative activity
generated by the race influence market structure?

Consider a patent race between two firms that can choose to invest in research with a
view to developing a new product. The first to make the breakthrough wins the race and
files a patent giving that firm exclusive rights to its invention. This is what gives the race
its winner-take-all aspect. The loser walks away less than empty-handed, having expended
resources on R&D with no return.

Let there be two firms, BMI and ECN, who both are considering doing the R&D
necessary to create a new product. They each estimate that if the innovation is successful
they can produce this new product at a marginal cost of _c_ and that demand for the new
good is _P_ = _A_ - _BQ_ . They are also confident that the new product is a sufficiently radical
departure that it will have a negligible impact on their existing businesses and so will not
affect their existing profits—that is, there is no replacement effect.

The R&D effort by each firm requires establishment of a research division that costs
a fixed sum, _K_ . This sum covers both the costs of research and of development if the
research is successful and, once sunk, can never be recaptured. Given that such a division
is established, the probability of a successful innovation is _ρ_ . If only one firm is successful
in its R&D efforts, we assume that the innovation is protected from imitation, perhaps by a
patent or by some other means so that the successful innovator earns the monopoly profit. If
both are successful simultaneously, both firms file a patent application and we assume that
each firm has a 50 percent probability of its patent application being successful, in which
case this firm earns the monopoly profit. To keep matters reasonably simple, we assume
that both firms discount the future heavily—that is, the interest rate _r_ is so large that the
discount factor _R_ ≈ 0 _._

In order to identify the incentives each firm has to establish the research division, we need
to identify their profits with and without a successful innovation. If neither firm attempts to
develop the new product, neither firm enters this new market. As a result, each earns zero
profit in this new market.

If both firms undertake R&D but only one firm, say BMI, is successful in its R&D efforts
while ECN is not, then BMI will be a monopolist in the new product market earning the
monopoly profits. ECN will earn nothing from the new market. The profits of the two firms
in this case, again ignoring the costs of establishing the R&D division, become

_πb_ = _[(A]_ [ −] 4 _B_ _[c)]_ [2] ; _πe_ = 0 (21.5)

Of course, if ECN is successful but BMI is not, these profits are reversed.

Conversely, if both firms undertake R&D and both are successful in making the
innovation, each has a 50 percent probability of being awarded a patent, so that expected
profit, ignoring the costs of establishing the R&D division, is

_πb_ = _πe_ = _[(A]_ [ −] 8 _B_ _[c)]_ [2] (21.6)

We can now calculate the expected profit for each firm depending on whether or not it
establishes a research division. If neither firm sets up such a division, neither innovates and
each earns zero profit in this new market. Now consider the expected profit if only one


586 Non-Price Competition


firm, say BMI, establishes an R&D division. For BMI expected profit is made up of two
components:


1. profit if the R&D division is unsuccessful, which is zero and occurs with probability
_(_ 1 − _ρ)_ ;
2. profit if the R&D division is successful, which is the monopoly profit _(_ A − _c)_ [2] _/_ 4 _B_ and
occurs with probability _ρ._


As a result, the expected _net_ profit of BMI if it is the only firm to establish an R&D
division is

_πb_ = _ρ_ _[(A]_ [ −] 4 _B_ _[c)]_ [2]  - _K_ (21.7)

Of course, the expected profit of ECN, given that only BMI has established an R&D
division, is zero. By symmetry, we reverse these payoffs to get expected profits if ECN is
the only firm to establish a research division.

If both firms establish R&D divisions, the expected profit to either firm is given by


1. profit if the firm’s R&D division is successful and the rival’s is not, which is
_(_ A − _c)_ [2] _/_ 4 _B,_ and occurs with probability _ρ(_ 1 − _ρ)_ ;
2. profit if both R&D divisions are successful and the firm wins the patent application,
which is _(_ A − _c)_ [2] _/_ 8 _B,_ and occurs with probability _ρ_ [2] .

Of course if neither firm is successful in R&D they earn nothing from the new market.
This means that the expected _net_ profit of each firm, given that they both operate R&D
divisions, is



_πb_ = _πe_ = _ρ(_ 1 − _ρ)_ _[(A]_ [ −] 4 _B_ _[c)]_ [2]

_K_ _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_ [2]
8 _B_ - = 8 _B_



_ρ(_ 2 _ρ)_ _K_ (21.8)
8 _B_ - 


Before we put these payoffs into a payoff matrix, we can do a bit of simplifying. The
profit equations share a common expression, the monopoly profit, which we denote as
_M_ = _(_ A − _c)_ [2] _/_ 4 _B_ . We can use this to define a parameter _S_ = _K/M,_ which is the share of
the monopoly profits that are needed to establish the R&D division. With the substitution of
_S_ and _M,_ the expected profits are summarized in the payoff matrix of Table 21.1 (below).
This matrix allows us to identify the possible Nash equilibria for this R&D game. As we
shall see, these are dependent upon the relative magnitudes of the two parameters, _S_ and _ρ._

There are three possibilities that have to be considered:


1. _Neither Firm Wishes to Establish an R&D Division_ . For this to be a Nash equilibrium,
the payoff to BMI, for example, from not having an R&D division, given that ECN also
has no R&D division, must be greater than the expected profit from investing in R&D,

again given that ECN does not. In other words, BMI expects to make more profit from
the strategy combination (No R&D, No R&D) than from the combination (No R&D,
R&D). This requires that _M(ρ_   - _S) <_ 0 _,_ which implies that _S > ρ,_ the probability of
success is less than the fraction of monopoly profit required to fund the R&D. This
expression is illustrated by the line 0A in Figure 21.2. All parameter combinations
above 0A give the Nash equilibrium (No R&D, No R&D).
2. _Only One Firm Wishes to Establish an R&D Division_ . Assume that the firm that
establishes the R&D division is BMI. Then for the strategy (No R&D, R&D) to be a
Nash equilibrium, two conditions must be satisfied:



a. BMI expects its expenditure on R&D to be profitable, given that ECN is not
investing in R&D—that is, BMI expects to make more profit from the strategy
combination (No R&D, R&D) than from the strategy combination (No R&D, No
R&D). This is just the opposite of the expression derived in part 1. It requires that
_S < ρ._
b. ECN does not expect its expenditure on R&D to be profitable, given that BMI
is investing in R&D—that is, ECN prefers the strategy combination (No R&D,
R&D) to (R&D, R&D). For this to be the case, the following must be true:



_<_ 0 which requires that _S >_ _[ρ(]_ [2][ −] _[ρ)]_

between 0A and 0B are such that only one of the firms will establish an R&D
division.

payoff to, for example, BMI from having an R&D division, given that ECN also has
an R&D division, must be greater than the expected profit from not investing in R&D,
again given that ECN does. In other words, BMI expects to make more profit from
the strategy combination (R&D, R&D) than from the strategy combination (R&D, No
R&D). For this to be the case we must have that

Of course, exactly the same condition guarantees that ECN prefers the strategy combination (R&D, R&D) to the strategy combination (No R&D, R&D). Thus, all parameter
combinations below 0B are such that both firms will establish an R&D division.

One question about patent races is whether the potential profit from successful innovation
can lead the two firms to overinvest in R&D. Neither of the firms establishes an R&D
division unless this division is expected to be profitable. For the strategies (R&D, No R&D),
(No R&D, R&D), and (R&D, R&D) to be equilibria, they must each give positive expected
profits to the two firms. This tells us that no equilibrium in which only one firm invests
in R&D is characterized by “excessive” R&D in the sense that the firms would be better
off without the R&D. The question that is left is whether there is “too much” R&D when
both firms establish R&D divisions. Are there situations in which the strategy combination
(R&D, R&D) is a Nash equilibrium but generates less aggregate profit than the strategy
combinations (R&D, No R&D) or (No R&D, R&D)? For this to be the case, it must be that

This is illustrated by the curve 0C in Figure 21.2. All parameter combinations between
0C and 0B lead to excessive R&D as the two firms race to be first to discover and introduce
the new product.

Our simple model delineates three distinct possibilities. First, neither firm will invest
in R&D unless it is expected to be profitable. Hence R&D must have a reasonably low
cost relative to the monopoly profits that it might generate (low _S_ ), or a reasonably high
probability of success. Second, for any given probability of success, a larger number of
firms will establish R&D facilities when there is a lower cost of R&D relative to the profit
the innovation is expected to generate. Thus, for any given probability of success _ρ,_ the
equilibrium number of firms with R&D divisions increases from zero to one and finally to
two as _S_ is reduced. Third, there is an intermediate range of values for the cost of R&D
in which there is excessive R&D in that both firms establish R&D divisions although this
reduces their aggregate profits. In this range, the lure of profit from innovation involves the
firms in a competitive R&D race that they would be better to avoid.

So far, we have only considered the gain that research brings in terms of the expected
profit of the two firms. From a public policy perspective, however, increased profit is not the
only potential benefit of innovation. We should also consider the gain in consumer surplus
that development of this new product will generate. While we have just shown that the level
of R&D activity can be excessive from the viewpoint of the firms’ combined profits, we
have not demonstrated that this is the case when viewed with the objective of maximizing
the total gain of profit plus consumer surplus. The R&D which seems excessive to the
firms may still be worthwhile to society overall if the additional consumer surplus more
than offsets the reduction in aggregate profit. However, R&D can be excessive even when
evaluated with this broader criterion, (see Practice Problem 21.2). The patent race can lead
both firms to establish research divisions even when the total cost of such divisions is not
justified by the sum of expected producer and consumer surplus.

Even more interesting is that we can easily show that the possibility of too little R&D—as
judged from a social welfare perspective—is quite real. Suppose that _S > ρ,_ in which case
neither firm undertakes R&D. Suppose further that _S_ is so close to _ρ_ that one firm could
almost expect to break even if it pursued the innovation and its rival did not. If the new
product generates any significant consumer surplus at all, then it is socially desirable that
the research takes place. The value of the expected consumer surplus more than provides
