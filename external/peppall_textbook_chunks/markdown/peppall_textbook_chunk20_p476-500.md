unless that agreement includes an RPM provision. Without an RPM agreement, there will
be a tendency for the retail price to be too low to consumers with more elastic demand and
too high to those whose demand is less elastic. [4]

As noted in the Reality Checkpoint above, the Supreme Court’s ruling in the _State_
_Oil vs. Khan_ case removed the _per se_ presumption against RPM agreements specifying
a maximum price. In this case, State Oil Co. had imposed a maximum retail price on its
distributors and one of these, Barkat Khan, tried to exceed that price _to premium buyers_ . At
the same time, he wanted to keep a low price to consumers of regular grade fuel. That is,
Khan wanted to price discriminate. The RPM agreement subsequently legitimized by the
Supreme Court appears to have been motivated in part by State Oil’s need to prevent such
price discrimination. In turn, this suggests that this motivation may well be important in
promoting RPM contracts more generally.


17.4 RPM AGREEMENTS TO INSURE THE PROVISION
OF RETAIL SERVICES


In the preceding two sections, we have investigated the use of an RPM agreement to set
a ceiling on the price consumers pay. Note that even in the price discrimination case,
double-marginalization plays a critical role. The difficulty is that the retailer will always
want to add a higher, second markup to the price charged to the less elastic market segment.
As the _Albrecht_ and _Khan_ cases (see above Reality Checkpoint) illustrate, this need to set
an upper limit on retail prices is clearly one of the forces behind such vertical restraints.
However, there are a number of reasons to doubt that double-marginalization and the need
to limit downstream markups can be the sole or perhaps even the major explanation for
observed RPM agreements.

First, note that the double-marginalization problem only arises when both the upstream
and the downstream market are characterized by imperfect competition. If the downstream
market is competitive, the manufacturer can set an upstream price of _PU_ = _P_ _[D]_ [∗] without
fear of a second markup further distorting this price. Likewise, if the upstream market were
competitive, the wholesale price would be equal to marginal cost _c_, and any downstream
markup would never result in a price greater than _P_ _[D]_ [∗] .

Moreover, even when market power exists in both the upstream and downstream markets,
there will often remain other, non-RPM solutions to the double-marginalization problem.
As we noted in our single-market case of section 17.2, a two-part tariff can often resolve the
problem. Even in the price discrimination case, an alternative contract based on a _minimum_
retail price can do the trick. Specifically, the manufacturer could set a wholesale price of
$20 and impose an RPM requirement that the retail price never fall _below_ $60. This will
lead to a competitive market price of $60 by virtue of the RPM price floor. It will also lead
to a retail price of $60 in the monopolized market by virtue of retail profit monopolization.
The manufacturer can then claim the $1,600 via an upfront fee of _T_ = $1600. [5]

Finally, the historical evidence is that it has primarily been the retail lobby that has
consistently led the fight to legalize and enforce RPM agreements at both the federal and
state levels. In addition, as documented by both Overstreet (1983) and Steiner (1985), the
vast majority of RPM court cases have been ones in which the issue was the setting of a

minimum retail price, not a maximum price. Similar evidence for the United Kingdom has
been presented by Pickering (1966).

A clue to why our analysis so far has not emphasized RPM minimum price restraints is
that we have only viewed retailing as an extra stage that occurs between production and final
consumption. While insightful, this approach fails to incorporate any actual positive role for
retailers. Yet retailers such as supermarkets, discount chains, and department stores provide
many services that are valuable to manufacturers. Not only do they gather information
about customer satisfaction and desired changes in the manufacturer’s product, but they
also provide such valuable services as the provision of desirable shelf space, large displays,
advertising, and product demonstration. These services can be crucial to the marketing and
sales of the manufacturer’s product.

Consider the magazine industry. Supermarkets and discount chains presently account for
over 60 percent of single-copy sales of US magazines. Because such sales are made at the
full, nonsubscription price, they are profitable and quite important to publishing firms. Yet
the publishers must rely heavily on the efforts of the retailers to sell their magazines. A
prominent display near the checkout register, for example, can greatly increase sales. So
can advertising or a promotional visit to the store by a celebrity. Publishers have a deep
interest in making sure that the retailers undertake such efforts. Historically, publishers of
_People_ and other magazines, such as _Cosmopolitan_ and _Harper’s Bazaar_, have had tense
negotiations with retailers such as Wal-Mart and Winn Dixie supermarkets over the display
and promotion of various issues of these publications. [6]

A complete model of the relationship between a manufacturer and its retailers should
therefore address the upstream manufacturer’s interest in the provision of retail services,
and the motivation for the retailer to incur the expense of such services. Promotion, product
demonstration, and simply providing a pleasant place to shop are costly. Moreover, it is
extremely difficult for the manufacturer to monitor the provision of such services. Taken
together, these two facts mean that a manufacturer cannot simply specify the level of retail
services that it wants for its product and assume that it will be provided. What is required
is an enforceable contract that specifies the obligations of both the manufacturer and the
retailer. It is this aspect of the vertical contract—that pertaining to the provision of retail
services—that we now wish to examine.

Let us begin by describing how demand is affected by retail services. Denote by _D(p, s)_
the amount of the good demanded at price _p_ with retail service level _s_ . Increases in the level
of services _s_ raise the quantity demanded at any price or, alternatively, raise the willingness
to pay of each consumer. We assume that this effect takes the form shown in Figure 17.1.
In this case an increase in the service level from, say, _s_ 1 to _s_ 2 raises the willingness to
pay of the marginal consumer. An example of a demand curve that captures this effect
is _Q(p, s)_ = _s(A_ - _p)N,_ where _N_ is the number of consumers in the market. In inverse
form, this is: _p_ = _A_ - _Q/sN_ . The top price anyone is willing to pay for the product is $ _A,_
no matter the service level, _s,_ but more is bought as _s_ rises.

Providing retail services is costly. Let the cost of supplying _s_ retail services per unit of
the good sold be described by a function _ϕ(s)_ . We will assume that the provision of retail
services is subject to diminishing returns so that raising the service level _s_ raises the cost
of providing such services and does so at an ever-increasing rate. (In calculus terms, this
means that both _ϕ_ ′ _(s)_ and _ϕ_ ′′ _(s)_ exceed zero.) For a given level of services, _s,_ the retailer’s

466 Contractual Relations Between Firms


marginal cost of selling the manufacturer’s product is _r_ + _ϕ(s)_ . This is the sum of the
wholesale price paid to the manufacturer _r_ plus the cost of providing _s_ retail services per
unit sold, _ϕ(s)_ .

We now consider the provision of retail services under a variety of circumstances. We
point out in advance that this presentation is a little advanced. For those who wish to skip
this section, our main result is that, in the absence of vertical price restraints, it is unlikely
that a retailer will provide the manufacturer’s preferred level of service. The intuition behind
this argument is straightforward. The manufacturer wants a high level of service because
this will raise the price consumers are willing to pay and, hence, the manufacturer’s profit.
Yet while the profit gain of better service flows at least in part to the manufacturer, the cost
of providing such service falls entirely on the retailer. Accordingly, the retailer’s incentive
to offer such service is reduced. Vertical restrictions such as a resale price maintenance
agreement may be a way to overcome this difficulty, at least in part.


17.4.1 Optimal Provision of Retail Services versus Vertically
Integrated Monopoly


Let’s start by figuring out what is the efficient level of services from the viewpoint of
society overall, i.e., the level that would maximize the combined consumer and producer
surplus. Recall that efficiency in a market requires that price equal marginal cost. Because
marginal cost for a given level of services is constant, we have that _p_ = _c_ + _ϕ(s),_ which
means that there is no producer surplus. As shown in Figure 17.1, the social surplus at any
price equal to _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ is just the triangular area above the cost line but below the demand
curve. Accordingly, the optimal choice of service level _s_ is the level of _s_ that maximizes
the area of this triangle. By definition, this area is given by {A − [ _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ ]} [2] _(Ns)/_ 2. We
show in the Appendix that the service level _s_ [∗] that maximizes this area must satisfy:

_(_ A − _c)/_ 2 = _ϕ(s_ [∗] _)/_ 2 + _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ [∗] _)s_ [∗] (17.1)

where _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ [∗] _)_ is the marginal impact of services on cost.

**Figure 17.1** The effect of services on demand, costs, and the social surplus
Demand is given by _P_ = _A_ - _Q/sN_ . This means that as the level of services rises from _s_ 1 to _s_ 2 the demand
curve rotates up and to the right. At service level _s_ 1 _,_ marginal cost _c_ _ϕ(s_ 1 _)_ . If price equals marginal cost,

Given a service level that satisfies (17.1), the socially optimal price is just the marginal cost
of providing the output _plus_ that service. Suppose for instance that _N_ = 100 _, c_ = 5 _, A_ = 10 _,_
and that _ϕ(s)_ = _s_ [2] so that _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ [∗] _)_ = 2 _s_ [∗] . A small bit of algebra then reveals that the social
optimum calls for a service level of _s_ [∗] = 1. (Remember, _s_ is an index and so it is measured
in arbitrary units.) At this level of service, optimality would require that the price be equal
to _c_ + _ϕ(s_ [∗] _)_ = $6.

Now consider what the outcome will be if the product is provided by a vertically
integrated monopolist producer and retailer. The profit of this integrated firm depends upon
the price it sets and the service level it provides, and is:


_π(p_ _[I]_ _, s)_ = _p_ _[I]_ _(_ A − _p_ _[I]_ _)Ns_  - [ _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ ] _(_ A − _p_ _[I]_ _)Ns_ (17.2)

Again, the derivation is provided in the Appendix but it is straightforward to show that the
integrated monopolist’s optimal service level must satisfy:


_(_ A − _c)/_ 2 = _ϕ(s_ _[I]_ _)/_ 2 + _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ _[I]_ _)s_ _[I]_ (17.3)

At this service level, the integrated monopolist will set a retail price of:


_p_ _[I]_ = [ _A_ + _c_ + _ϕ(s_ _[I]_ _)_ ] _/_ 2 (17.4)

We of course assume that _c_ + _ϕ(s_ _[I]_ _) <_ A, so that the optimal price insures positive
demand. A little reflection on equation (17.4) will reveal that it embodies our usual
monopoly relation of price to marginal cost except that now marginal cost includes the
service cost _ϕ(s_ _[I]_ _)_ as well as the production cost _c_ . As usual, the integrated monopolist will
set a price of obtaining a unit of the good along with a given service level that exceeds the
marginal cost of providing the good and the associated service cost _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ . This is shown
in Figure 17.2.

Comparing equations (17.4) and (17.1), it is clear that they are the same. Although the
integrated monopoly firm sets too high a price, the service level _s_ _[I]_ that it chooses is the
same as the socially optimal service level _s_ [∗] . Returning to our numerical example, with
_N_ = 100 _, c_ = 5 _, A_ = 10 _,_ and _ϕ(s)_ = _s_ [2] _,_ we find that the integrated monopolist will set
_s_ _[I]_ = 1 _,_ but set a retail price of _p_ _[I]_ = $8. This price combined with a service level of _s_ = 1 _,_
will yield a total market demand of 200 units, each of which incurs a $5 production cost and a
$1 service cost. So, the integrated monopolist will earn a profit of _(_ $8 − $6 _)_ × 200 = $400.

As it turns out, the specific result that the integrated monopolist chooses the socially
optimum service level reflects the particular demand and cost relationships that we assumed,
and is not fully general. Nevertheless, the result is useful because it does show a rather
general interest that the manufacturer has in providing retail services. As we shall shortly
see, this is why vertical price restrictions establishing a minimum price can play a potentially
welfare enhancing role.


17.4.2 The Case of a Monopoly Retailer and a Monopoly Manufacturer


Let’s next examine the case where the retailing of the good is done by an independent
monopoly downstream retailer. The manufacturer sells the product to the monopoly retailer
at price _r,_ after which the retailer sells the good to final consumers at retail price _p_ _[D]_ and
provides _s_ _[D]_ retail services. In accordance with the notation used above, the retailer’s profit
downstream is


_�_ _[D]_ _(p_ _[D]_ _, s_ _[D]_ _, r)_ = [ _p_ _[D]_ - _r_ - _ϕ(s_ _[D]_ _)_ ]D _(p_ _[D]_ _, s_ _[D]_ _)_ = [ _p_ _[D]_ - _r_ - _ϕ(s_ _[D]_ _)_ ] _s_ _[D]_ _N(A_ - _p_ _[D]_ _)._

(17.5)


As in the case of the integrated firm, the retailer must choose the two strategic variables,
retail price _p_ _[D]_ and the level of retail services _s_ _[D]_ . Note though that the retailer in this case
has exactly the same profit-maximizing problem as did the integrated firm of the previous
discussion, except that the retailer faces a marginal cost _r_ that may differ from the true
production cost _c,_ depending on the upstream firm’s wholesale price choice. So, we can
work out the monopoly retailer’s choices just by replacing _c_ with _r_ in equations (17.3) and
(17.4). This yields the choices _s_ _[D]_ and _p_ _[D]_ satisfying


_(A_  - _r)/_ 2 = _ϕ(s_ _[D]_ _)/_ 2 + _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ _[D]_ _)s_ _[D]_ (17.6)

and


_p_ _[D]_ _[A]_ [ +] _[ r]_ [ +] _[ ϕ(s][D][)]_ (17.7)
= 2


Because _r > c_ if the manufacturer is to earn any profit, the price implied by equation
(17.7) exceeds that implied by equation (17.5). This is simply the double-marginalization
problem again. At any given service level, the monopoly retailer adds the monopolist’s
markup to the markup already reflected in the manufacturer’s wholesale price. Yet as a
comparison of equations (17.6) and (17.4) also makes clear, having _r > c_ means that this
double-markup is now compounded by a further problem, namely, a suboptimally low level
of retail services. For any wholesale price _r > c_ the level of retail services chosen by the
retailer _s_ _[D]_ is less than the level _s_ [∗] that is optimal from the viewpoint of both society and
the upstream manufacturer.

Again, using the values from our numerical example, it is tedious but straightforward
to show that if the manufacturer chooses the wholesale price _r_ to maximize its profit, the
outcome will be: _r_ = $7; _p_ _[D]_ = $8.8; and _s_ = 0.775. Not only is the price too high, but the
service level is too low relative to the social optimum. Profit is $186 for the manufacturer
and $112 for the retailer, so the combined profit of $298 is well below the $400 profit of the


Vertical Price Restraints 469


integrated firm. The intuition behind this outcome is also straightforward. Providing retail
services is costly and this, along with the fact that the manufacturer charges a wholesale
price _r_ above marginal production cost, puts the squeeze on the retailer’s profit. In response,
the retailer tries to recapture some of the surplus by cutting back on services.

A two-part pricing agreement can resolve this issue. As usual, the manufacturer should
sell to the retailer at marginal cost _c,_ at which point the retailer’s profit maximization
problem becomes identical with that of the fully integrated firm. This will induce the
retailer to provide the optimal service level _s_ [∗] and price _p_ _[I]_ that generate the maximum
profit. The manufacturer can then claim all or part of that profit by its choice of the fixed
fee _T_ . Returning to our numerical example, _s_ [∗] = 1 _, r_ = _c_ = $5 _,_ and _p_ _[D]_ = _p_ _[I]_ = $8 and
$298 _< T <_ $400.


that the manufacturer sells through a monopoly retailer and initially sets a wholesale price,
r equal to $6. Assume that retail demand is _Q(p, s)_ = _s(_ 10 − _p)_ 100.


a. What will be the retail service level and the retail price? How much output will be sold
at this price and service level combination? What will be the manufacturer’s profit?
b. Compare the manufacturer’s profit at _r_ = $6 rise with its value at _r_ = $7. What does
this increase in _r_ do to the level of retail services?


17.4.3 The Case of Competitive Retailing


Let’s now consider the case of a competitive retailing sector. This is often the more realistic
case. It is also a market structure that should work to the manufacturer’s benefit. When
there is only one retailer, the manufacturer’s reach into the retail market is limited, as is
its bargaining power with respect to claiming any of the additional profit that coordination
yields. When there are many retailers, both the manufacturer’s reach and bargaining power
are enhanced. Competition among the retailers downstream will bring the retail price-cost
margin to zero, and therefore, minimize the problem of double marginalization. The issue of
the provision of promotional or retail services, though, still remains. We want to determine
the level of services _s_ _[c]_ provided by a competitive retail sector and compare that level
with the manufacturer’s preferred amount, _s_ [∗] .

We assume that all the downstream retailers are identical. Each buys the manufacturer’s
product at a wholesale price _r_ and incurs the cost _ϕ(s)_ per unit of output for retail service _s_ .
A little thinking leads us to two quick results. First, we know that retail competition will
drive the retail price down to marginal cost. In other words, the price to final consumers
will have to be _p_ = _r_ + _ϕ(s)_ . Second, that same competitive pressure will also force every
retailer to offer at that price, the level of services most preferred by consumers. Any
retailer who offered a lower service level would quickly lose all its customers. Accordingly,
competitive pressure will lead each and every retailer to offer the same retail price and
the same service package. The competitive retail price will be _p_ _[C]_ = _r_ + _ϕ(s_ _[C]_ _),_ and the
competitive service level _s_ _[C]_ will be the level that maximizes consumer surplus given the
price _p_ _[C]_ . In Section 17.4.1 we showed that when the price of the good is equal to its
true marginal cost, i.e., when _p_ = _c_ + _ϕ(s),_ consumer surplus is {A − [ _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ ] [2] _Ns/_ 2.

It follows that when price _p_ = _r_ + _ϕ(s)_ consumer surplus is just { _A_ - [ _r_ + _ϕ(s)_ ]} [2] _Ns/_ 2.
Maximizing this with respect to _s_ (see Appendix) yields the service level under competitive
retailing, _s_ _[C]_


_(_ A − r _)/_ 2 = _ϕ(s_ _[C]_ _)/_ 2 + _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ _[C]_ _)s_ _[C]_ (17.8)

where as before _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ _[C]_ _)_ is the marginal effect of service on cost(measured at the value _s_ _[C]_ ).

Comparison of the value _s_ _[c]_ that satisfies equation (17.8) with the manufacturer’s preferred
efficient level of services ( _s_ [∗] in equation (17.1) or _s_ _[I]_ in (17.3)) reveals that the competitive
outcome will again provide too low a level of services so long as the wholesale price _r_
exceeds the production cost _c_ . This time though, the reduction in services is not really the
result of retailers trying to cut services so as to increase their margin over cost. To the
contrary, retailers compete vigorously in providing services. Instead, the problem is that
there is in fact no “margin.” Competition drives the retail price to be precisely enough
to cover the wholesale price plus service cost and no more. While consumers like retail
services, they also like low prices and the competitive retail sector tries to give them a
bit of both. Thus, for example, if the manufacturer sets _r_ = $7 _,_ retailers will now provide
services of _s_ _[C]_ = 0.775 at a cost of $0.60. This is less than the service the manufacturer
would prefer but it allows the retailers to keep the price to consumers down to $7.60.


Vertical Price Restraints 471


The manufacturer earns a profit of $371.81 _,_ which turns out to be the best that can be done
in this case if we limit the manufacturer’s choice simply to choosing its own markup and
the implied wholesale price _r_ .

A solution to the problem must recognize two facts. First, a two-part tariff strategy is no
longer workable because there is no retail profit to extract via a lump sum fee _T_ . Second,
this is a case in which the retail price is too _low_ - $7.60 in our example relative to the
$8 price set by the integrated monopolist. Together, these two facts suggest that an RPM
agreement is needed and that in this case, the agreement should specify a _minimum_ price. In
particular, the manufacturer can employ an RPM setting a price floor equal to that chosen
by the integrated monopolist _p_ _[I]_ and then set the wholesale price _r_ just high enough to cover
the cost of the optimal service level _s_ _[I]_ _,_ that is, _r_ = _p_ _[I]_ - _ϕ(s_ _[I]_ _)_ . Unable to compete by
further price reductions, the competitive retailers will focus totally on service and compete
away all retail profit by providing exactly _s_ _[I]_ just as the manufacturer wishes. Returning
to our example, the manufacturer should impose an RPM agreement setting a price floor
of $8 but continue to set a wholesale price of $7. Retail competition in services will then
proceed until _s_ _[C]_ = 1 and _ϕ(s_ _[C]_ _)_ = 1 as well so that the downstream price _p_ _[D]_ = _r_ + _ϕ(s_ _[C]_ _)_ .
It is easy to verify that doing this will restore the manufacturer’s profit to $400—the same
profit as the fully integrated firm.


17.4.4 RPM Agreements, Service, and Free-Riding


One moral of the two cases just considered is that once the costly provision of customer
services is included in the analysis, an RPM agreement with a _minimum_ price becomes
more necessary to insure proper service provision as the downstream market becomes more
competitive. There is in fact another reason why this is likely to be the case. This is because
many customer services—particularly informational services such as advice on different
price and quality combinations, best use practices, and so forth—have the quality of a
public good. They are difficult to charge for and easily shared. As with all public goods,
provision of these services is likely to be too low.

Think about it for a moment. A consumer electronics shop may keep experts on hand to
assist a customer in choosing the digital camera that best meets the customer’s needs in
terms of portability and convenience, works most effectively with the customer’s computer
and other peripherals, and fits best within her budget. Similarly, wine shops may employ
personnel to advise customers regarding the quality of a particular vintage or the food that
best accompanies a given wine.

Providing such presale or point of sale services is costly. Unfortunately, there is no
obligation for the consumer, once educated by the store’s expert staff, to buy from that
specific establishment. Quite to the contrary, once fully informed, the consumer has a strong
incentive to go to the “no frills” electronics shop down the street or to the discount wine
shop around the corner and purchase what the consumer now knows to be the proper digital
camera and the appropriate wine at a lower price. Even worse, the consumer is free to share
this information with friends who can then use this knowledge to bypass the specialty shops
altogether and go directly to the low-price, low-service outlets.

Because information is a public good, it is hard to deny it even to those who do not pay
for it. The low-price discount dealers in our two simple examples are “free riding” on the
specialty shops. We call this behavior free riding because the discounter benefits from the
activities of the specialty shop but does not pay for them. The scenarios above indicate
the likely outcome of this problem. Specialty shops that incur the cost of providing in-store


472 Contractual Relations Between Firms


demonstrations and consultations will lose market share to the “no frills” discount stores.
As such discount stores come to dominate the retail market, few retail services will be
provided overall.

At this point, the advantage of an RPM agreement should be clear. It prevents one retailer
from undercutting another and, hence, stifles the emergence of discount stores. In turn, this
implies that consumers will visit the retailer who provides the best services because they
will not find a lower price elsewhere. By putting a freeze on price discounting, the effect of
an RPM agreement is to foreclose discount outlets, resulting in a possibly higher average
retail price. Yet this price effect and the loss it imposes on consumers may be offset by
the gains that the provision of retail services generate, not only for consumers but for the
manufacturer as well. [7]

Moreover, the free-riding justification for RPM applies to more than just purely informational services. For example, higher-end stores such as Bloomingdales, Neiman-Marcus,
and Bergdorf Goodman play an important role in identifying and then selling “what’s hot”
or in fashion. Here again though, providing this service is not cheap. These stores must
spend considerable resources to build up their reputation for being on the “cutting edge” of
fashion trends. Just by carrying the line of a specific manufacturer, such stores identify the
top brands and fashions. Manufacturers need retailers to play this role. Yet if a consumer
can go window shopping at a prestigious store to find out “what’s in” this season and then
buy the apparel at a discount store, we again have the problem of free riding and, along with
that, a potential justification for the use of an RPM agreement specifying a floor price. [8]


17.5 RETAIL PRICE MAINTENANCE AND UNCERTAIN DEMAND


We have been discussing in the preceding two sections the way in which competitive
pressures in the retail market can reduce the profit of the manufacturer and the welfare
of consumers by creating disincentives to provide customer services. However, retail
competition can be destructive in other ways as well. Deneckere et al. (1997) demonstrate
how uncertain retail demand can produce such an outcome. [9]

Goods are not sold continuously. Instead, retailers place orders with manufacturers and
then hold an inventory stock to buffer against movements in demand. As a result, each
retailer faces a dilemma in determining how much output to stock for sale to final consumers.
On the one hand, the retailer will wish to have the amount on hand necessary for profit
maximization during periods when demand is strong. On the other hand, if demand is weak,
retailers with a lot of stock will have to do one of two things. Either they try to sell the
output or they can absorb the extra output (or simply throw it away) and thereby keep the
price high. [10]

It is in this situation that the behavior of the monopolist and the competitive firm will
differ. Faced with weak demand, the monopolist will tend just to dispose of (or just hold
indefinitely) a good bit of its excess inventory because the monopolist recognizes that every


7 Tesler (1960) first articulated this view. See also Bork (1966). For an opposing view see Steiner (1985).
8 Mathewson and Winter (1983) make a similar argument that resale price maintenance can benefit consumers
by economizing on consumer search costs because consumers will no longer spend time trying to find out

extra unit sold lowers the price on all units. A firm in a competitive retail sector, however,
will do the opposite. Under competition, each retailer perceives that its own sales have no
or little effect on the market price. Accordingly, each such competitive retailer will try to
sell all of its stock. After all, it has already paid for it and it may as well try to get something
for it rather than throw any of it away. The problem is that if all retailers act this way the
market the price will fall, possibly quite far.

The fact that competition induces sharp price-cutting during periods of weak demand
has two implications. First, a manufacturer selling through a competitive retail sector will
not earn the profit of an integrated firm. Second, the manufacturer will also find it difficult
to induce retailers to hold any sizable inventory because retailers will recognize that they
might end up getting rid of that inventory at a very low price. An RPM agreement that
establishes a minimum retail price can solve the manufacturer’s problem. The reason is
straightforward. Setting a minimum price at which the good can be sold ensures that in
periods of low demand, retailers will deal with excess inventory exactly the way that an
integrated manufacturer would choose. They will throw away the amount that cannot be
sold at the specified retail price.

We illustrate the essential insight of the Deneckere et al. argument in Figure 17.3. The
figure shows the price and profit outcome for an integrated monopolist manufacturer facing
variable demand. As usual, we assume a constant unit cost, _c_ . With probability one-half,
demand is strong and the demand curve is _DH_ . Similarly, with probability one-half, demand
is weak and the demand curve is _DL_ . The integrated monopolist then faces a two-stage
problem. In stage one, the firm must choose how much to produce, _Q_ . Once the firm
has produced this amount, it will have incurred a cost, which is now sunk, equal to _cQ_ .
Afterwards, demand will be either strong or weak, _DH_ or _DL_ . At that point, the firm
will have no additional cost and will simply have to choose how much of the output in its
inventory that it actually wants to sell. Of course, the integrated firm can sell no more than
it originally produced, _Q_ . Subject to this constraint, however, it will simply sell the amount
that maximizes its revenue conditional upon demand. Because all its costs are sunk, revenue
maximization and profit maximization amount to the same thing in the second stage.

The integrated firm will never initially produce more than the amount that would
maximize profit if it knew for sure that demand would be high. This is an amount at which
the marginal revenue when demand is _DH_ equals marginal production cost, _c_ . It is shown
as _Q_ _[UPPER]_ in Figure 17.3. To produce more than this level would guarantee that the firm

earns a marginal revenue below its production cost even in the best of demand conditions.
Similarly, the firm will never produce for inventory an amount less than _Q_ _[LOWER]_ _,_ the
amount it would produce if it were certain demand would be low. To do so would guarantee
too little inventory even in the weakest of markets. The firm must produce somewhere
between _Q_ _[LOWER]_ and _Q_ _[UPPER]_ . Within this interval, optimization requires that it choose an
amount whereby its marginal cost _c_ equals its expected marginal revenue, or one-half times
the marginal revenue in a high-demand state plus one-half times the marginal revenue in a
low-demand state (which is bounded by zero).

As we have drawn Figure 17.3, the optimal amount of initial production is _Q_ [∗] . Note
that in this figure, demand is quite variable. As a result, in order to come even close to the
true profit-maximizing level in a high-demand state, the amount produced for inventory _Q_ [∗]



would be enough to drive the price to zero if it is all sold in a weak-demand state.



_MAX_

If demand is strong, the firm will sell the entire amount _Q_ [∗] at the price _PH_ . If demand

is weak, an inventory of _Q_ [∗] is excessive. Because the integrated firm has already incurred
its production cost, all it can do then is maximize its revenue. It will do this by selling the

_MIN_

amount _Q_ [∗] [at the price,] _[ P]_ _L_ . This is an output at which marginal revenue is zero. Weak



If demand is strong, the firm will sell the entire amount _Q_ [∗] at the price _PH_



_MIN_

amount _Q_ [∗] _L_ [at the price,] _[ P]_ _L_ . This is an output at which marginal revenue is zero. Weak

demand does not lead the firm to try to liquidate its entire inventory, as such an action
would drive the price to zero. Instead, the firm throws away the amount _Q_ [∗] _QL_ ∗. When

                    



[∗] _L_ [at the price,] _[ P]_ _L_



would drive the price to zero. Instead, the firm throws away the amount _Q_ [∗] _QL_ ∗. When

                    
demand is weak, the firm drives its marginal revenue to zero. However, because this occurs
where the price is still positive, the firm’s total revenue remains greater than zero even
in the face of weak demand. Its marginal revenue when demand is strong is the marginal

Now consider what happens under competitive retailing. If competitive retailers stocked
the optimal amount _Q_ [∗] _,_ they would earn less total profit than that shown in equation
(17.9). The reason is the nature of competition. In a low-demand period, the integrated
firm sells only up to the point at which its marginal revenue is zero. However, competitive
firms holding a total inventory of _Q_ [∗] will sell more than this amount. Each such firm
perceives price and marginal revenue to be the same. Hence, having already sunk the cost
of acquiring its inventory, each such firm will continue to sell its inventory so long as the
price is positive. Yet if demand is weak, the amount _Q_ [∗] can only be sold by driving the
retail price—and not just the marginal revenue—to zero. This means that a competitive
retail sector with an inventory equal to _Q_ [∗] will earn no revenue when demand is low. Of

_MAX_

course, when demand is high, retailers will sell the entire stock _Q_ [∗] for the price _PH_ and

generate exactly the same revenue as would an integrated monopolist. However, because
the competitive outcome during a low-demand period is a zero price, competitive retailers
will always generate less total profit from the optimal inventory stock, _Q_ [∗] _,_ than would an
integrated monopolist whose revenue remains positive even when demand is weak.

In short, unfettered competition during a period of weak demand dramatically reduces
the revenue retailers can expect to earn. Accordingly, a manufacturer can only persuade


Vertical Price Restraints 475



retailers to stock the optimal amount _Q_ [∗] by selling to them at a sufficiently low wholesale
price _PW_ _,_ so that retailers can still expect to break even. Because retailers only earn positive
revenue when demand is high, _PW_ _Q_ [∗] must equal the revenue earned by retailers in a
high-demand period, times the probability that such a period occurs. Therefore, _PW_ _Q_ [∗] must
equal _PH_ _MAX Q_ ∗ _/_ 2 _,_ implying that _PW_ _PH_ _MAX/_ 2. In turn, this implies an expected profit,

At this wholesale price, the competitive retail sector will in fact buy and inventory the
optimal amount,revenue, _PH_ _MAX Q Q_ ∗∗ _/_ . Why? When they buy this amount, retailers know that their expected2 _PLMIN QL_ ∗ _/_ 2 _,_ just equals their expected cost, _PW_ ∗ _Q_ ∗. Hence, the

A comparison of equations (17.9) and (17.13) quickly reveals that this RPM agreement
permits the manufacturer in this case to earn the same profit as that earned by an integrated
firm.

It is important to note that it is not just the manufacturer who may benefit from the RPM
agreement just described. Such an agreement can potentially also enlarge the expected
consumer surplus. This is easiest to see by recognizing that absent an RPM agreement,
retailers may not be willing to offer the product to consumers at all. More generally,
competitive retailers will buy less inventory in equilibrium without an RPM agreement
than they will buy with one. As a result, the price during a period of strong demand will be
higher without an RPM contract. This price increase hurts consumers and may more than
offset the gains consumers enjoy from permitting prices to fall quite far when demand is

weak. Hence, under uncertain demand in a competitive retail sector, both the manufacturer
and consumers can benefit from an RPM agreement. [11]

initially an inventory of 500? What will be the manufacturer’s profit at this price?


17.6 RPM AGREEMENTS AND COLLUSION


We noted at the beginning of this chapter that while academics and the courts have varied in
their views of non-price vertical restraints (next chapter), there is a long tradition that views
vertical restrictions on prices—particularly RPM agreements—much more negatively.
Indeed, until quite recently, all such agreements were held to be _per se_ illegal. Given that
the examples thus far considered in this chapter point to a positive role for RPM agreements,
one might wonder why the suspicion of RPM agreements has been so persistent and so
long-lasting.

The critical element contributing to the negative view of vertical price restraints is the
suspicion that these agreements substantially raise the possibility that firms can collude,
i.e., that they facilitate the suppression of interbrand competition. The US Supreme
Court was explicit on this point. In the _Business Electronics v. Sharp Electronics_ case
(1988), the Court wrote that “there is a significant distinction between vertical price and
vertical non-price restraints.” The Court continued by noting that there has long been
a presumption that “vertical price restraints reduce interbrand competition because they
‘facilitate cartelizing.’” [12] Yet while the fear that RPM might facilitate collusion may be
legitimate, formal analysis of this hypothesis has been limited. However, two recent papers
illustrate why this concern may be legitimate.

The first of these is Jullien and Rey (2007). The intuition in this paper is quite
straightforward. Consider two manufacturers, each of whom sells a differentiated product


11 The manufacturer always gains from the specified RPM agreement. The outcome for consumers depends
on just how variable is demand. If demand is highly variable, consumers are probably hurt by the
agreement. However, if demand is only moderately variable, consumers may well benefit from the
agreement.
12 _Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics_, 485 U.S. 717 (1988). The Court’s statement refers to its
earlier analysis in _Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc_ . 433 U.S. 36 (1977).




Vertical Price Restraints 477


and who compete in prices as described in Chapter 10. Each manufacturer sells to final
consumers through its own exclusive retailer at a wholesale price _wi_ who, in turn, sets the
final retail price _pi_ . It is, of course, that pair of final prices that determines the sales of the
upstream producers. Marginal cost is assumed to be zero. The retail demand facing each is:


_pi_ A _qi_ _βpj_ _εi_ _i, j_ 1,2 _i_ _j_ 0 _< β <_ 1 (17.14)
=  - + + = ̸=

Here, _εi_ is a random shock term reflecting the variation in retail demand _qi_ . Such shocks
occur after the wholesale price has been set but before the retail price is determined.
Critically, firm _j_ and its retailer can observe only the price _pi_ that retailer _i_ sets in response
to manufacturer _i_ ’s wholesale price _wi,_ and the demand shock _εI_ . From Chapter 10 we
know that _i_ ’s best response, given its observed� - - - _εI_ shock and its expectation for firm _j_ ’s

In other words, firm _i_ ’s retailer would adjust its retail price in response to demand shocks
to be different from what was initially expected. This flexibility however makes collusion
more difficult. It means that if firm _i_ observes a low retail price _pj_ being charged by its rival,
it cannot tell whether that is due to a negative demand shock, a move on _i_ ’s part to price more
aggressively or, in the context of collusion, to cheat on the cartel. Consequently, cheating
detection is difficult, and, as we know, this makes it more difficult to sustain a cartel.

Matters change with an RPM agreement. Now, any change in the retail price can only
occur if the upstream manufacturer changes the RPM price bound. Accordingly, the RPM
agreement facilitates collusion. It is not a perfect outcome. The fact that retail prices are
pre-set now means that they cannot react to demand shocks and this is a true cost. In
addition, because collusion with an RPM agreement permits pushing the price closer to the
joint monopoly price than collusion without an RPM agreement does, the one-period gain
from cheating is larger when RPM agreements are employed. This of course makes the
cartel less sustainable. Still, Jullien and Rey (2007) show that the detection effect will often
win out. When it does, firms will find it profitable to adopt RPM agreements that lead to
retail prices close to the joint-profit-maximizing level, and that leave consumers worse off.

More recently, Rey and Verg´e (2010) offer an alternative model of RPM-facilitated
collusion in which, contrary to the case above, manufacturers sell through the same
distributors. To take the simplest case, imagine two upstream manufacturers, A and B, and
initially, just one downstream retailer that we will call retailer 1. This retailer then sells two
differentiated goods that we will call A1 and B1. If retailer 1 could buy at cost from each
producer it would then set prices _p_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ [∗] 1 [that would maximize its joint profit from the]



_A_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ _B_ [∗]



producer it would then set prices _pA_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ _B_ [∗] 1 [that would maximize its joint profit from the]

two products. That is, retailer 1 would internalize the competition between the two products
and so coordinate their prices to earn the maximum profit possible in this market. The
prices _p_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ [∗] 1 [are, in fact, precisely the prices that would be set by the manufacturers]



_A_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ _B_ [∗]



prices _pA_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ _B_ [∗] 1 [are, in fact, precisely the prices that would be set by the manufacturers]

themselves if they were fully integrated firms and were cooperating with each other.

The outcome just described is in fact achievable by each manufacturer using a two-part
contract in which each sells to the retailer at cost and then claims its share of the resultant


478 Contractual Relations Between Firms


profit for itself via the fixed fee. To see this, suppose that firm A adapts such a two-part
pricing scheme in which it sells to retailer 1 at a price per unit equal to marginal cost and
then takes a chunk of profit by way of a fixed fee _FA_ . Given that, the best that firm B can
do is to work out a contract that will maximize the retailer’s profit net of its payment to
firm A, and then claim that profit with a fixed fee _FB_ . The way to do this is again to price at
marginal cost. No RPM agreement is necessary to achieve the joint (three-way) maximum
profit when both producers sell through a single retailer.

Matters change though if the two producers also sell through a second downstream
firm, retailer 2. The reason is that there is now retail competition as well as upstream
competition. Analogous to _p_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ [∗] 1 [, denote now the prices] _[ p]_ [∗] 2 [and] _[ p]_ [∗] 2 [as the]

monopoly profit-maximizing prices that would be set if both producers sold only through
retailer 2. Suppose for example that both manufacturers adopt the foregoing two-part pricing
at both downstream retailers in the hope that this will yield the four final market prices,
_p_ [∗] 1 _[, p]_ [∗] 1 _[, p]_ [∗] 2 [, and] _[ p]_ [∗] 2 [. Because the retailers are buying at cost, however, setting these]

prices implies that each retail price reflects the highest possible markup. As a result, each
retailer will find that it can increase its profit significantly by cutting either of its retail prices
and stealing business from its rival. Indeed, each producer will be tempted in this way as well.

To put it another way, the pair of prices _pA_ [∗] 1 [and] _[ p]_ _B_ [∗] 1 [are not retailer 1’s best response]

to a choice by retailer 2 to charge the prices _pA_ [∗] 2 [and] _[ p]_ _B_ [∗] 2 [. Because each manufacturer is]

selling at cost, the margin on additional retail sales is very large—creating an equally large
incentive to cut retail prices. Manufacturers can dull this incentive by instead selling at a
wholesale price _r_ that exceeds marginal cost. Yet this runs into two problems. The first is
the familiar one of double-marginalization. The second is the related one that if producer A
sets a wholesale price above marginal cost, producer B has an incentive to undercut this so
that its products will sell at lower retail prices. In other words, for feasible contract types
the retail competition is likely to extend upward to wholesale price competition between the
manufacturers. Rey and Verg´e (2010) show that in the absence of any RPM agreements, the
market outcome is likely to be fairly competitive.

The appeal of RPM agreements now is clear. They suppress retail competition. If for
example retailers are perfect Bertrand competitors, wholesale prices map one for one into
retail prices and manufacturers compete directly with each other via wholesale prices. RPM
agreements weaken this link by allowing a positive retail margin (and can never do worse
than a no RPM strategy). [13]


17.7 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: RPM AND PRICES—EVIDENCE
AFTER LEEGIN


Vertical price restraints have been the subject of both considerable academic debate and spirited as well as evolving legal controversies. The recent court decisions in _State Oil v. Khan_
and, even more particularly, _Leegin_ however mark a clear shift in antitrust doctrine towards
more acceptance of vertical price restraints, including RPM agreements, in the recognition
that the coordination such restraints make possible may well work to the benefit of consumers. Yet it seems clear that there are potential pitfalls in this approach and that tolerance
of RPM agreements can yield results inimical to consumers and economic efficiency.


13 Rey and Verg´e (2010) make clear that the joint monopoly outcome is just one of a continuum of possible
equilbria, with each equilibrium corresponding to a different wholesale price. In many ways, the Rey and
Verg´e (2010) analysis is a generalization of the earlier analysis in Bernheim and Winston (1985).


Vertical Price Restraints 479


An interesting paper by Smith and MacKay (2013) explores the effect of RPM on prices
by considering the effect of the _Leegin_ decision across different states. While the _Leegin_
decision made clear that the federal courts would now treat RPM agreements more leniently,
the impact on state laws and legal practices was less clear. Many states, such as Texas, do
include formal statements in their business and commercial codes that they will be guided
by and follow closely federal precedent where applicable. In these states, the change in the
federal approach to a rule-of-reason treatment of RPM agreements that _Leegin_ introduced
would likely liberalize their legal treatment of such agreements as well. On the other hand,
there are a number of states, such as California, in which the state antitrust laws and court
precedents indicate a very strong presumption that RPM contracts are a _per se_ violation of
the antitrust laws. To the extent that antitrust litigation is rooted in local courts, the _Leegin_
ruling might not have very much impact on these states.

Smith and MacKay (2013) use the foregoing logic to frame a natural experiment designed
to reveal the impact of RPM agreements. Based on their legal and legislative history they
identify a group of twenty-four states in which the _Leegin_ decision would likely lead to
a more legally tolerant view of RPM contracts, and a group of eleven states in which
the _Leegin_ decision is unlikely to change the (much harsher) legal treatment of these
agreements. They then use data from a relatively new data set collected by Nielsen on actual
weekly purchases by consumers of literally thousands of items over the years 2004–09.
While this includes 1.4 million separate products, Nielsen groups these products in 1,025
modules such as “brandy” or “sleeping aids.” Smith and MacKay (2013) were able to
examine 1,025 of these.

Smith and MacKay (2013) then construct a weighted price (in logs) for each product sold
by each retailer in each state in each week _t_ . For each of the 1,025 product modules, they
then estimate the following regression:


ln _Pjrst_ _α_ _β_ 1 _RoR_ _β_ 2 _Lt_ _β_ 3 _(L_ _RoRS)_
= + + + ×

Other characteristics and Fixed Effects _εjrst_
+ +

Here, ln _Pjsrt_ is the log price of product _j_ sold by retailer _r_ in state _s_ and week _t_ ; _RoRS_ is
an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if that state _s_ is in the Rule of Reason group,
and 0 for the control group comprised of those states with strong _per se_ presumptions of
illegality in which _Leegin_ is expected to have little effect. _L_ is an indicator variable that
takes the value 1 if the observation is in a week _t_ that is after the _Leegin_ decision on 28 June
2007 but 0 before that date. Finally, _L_ [∗] _RoRt_ is an interactive term that is 1 in all weeks
after the _Leegin_ decision but only for the Rule of Reason groups of states. In all other cases
it is 0.

It is the coefficient _β_ 3 on the third term that is most critical. The coefficient _β_ 1 indicates
the general difference in prices between the _RoR_ group and the control group of _per se_
states. The coefficient _β_ 2 reflects the general effect that the _Leegin_ decision had on both
groups of states. It is the coefficient _β_ 3 though that captures the difference in the effect that
the _Leegin_ decision had on the RoR group _relative_ to the control group. Thus, the coefficient
_β_ 3 is really the “difference-in-difference” estimator discussed earlier in Chapter 10. That is,
it will capture how much more (if any) prices have risen in the Rule of Reason states after
_Leegin_ than in the control group of _per se_ states.

Nielsen categorizes each of the 1,025 product modules as being in one of ten product
departments. It is useful to summarize the results for each of the 1,025 regression by this
department type. This is shown for the most basic Smith and MacKay model in Table 17.1.


480 Contractual Relations Between Firms


The results shown in Table 17.1 are somewhat striking. In 61 percent of the products
studied, the estimate of _β_ 3 was positive. It was significantly so in over 15 percent and
significantly negative in less than 6 percent. The median price effect in the states historically
leaning toward a Rule of Reason approach ranges from a low of 1.3 percent to a high of
8.6 percent. Moreover, these increases are typically associated with declines in the quantity
sold. This strongly suggests that the greater national legal tolerance of minimum RPM
agreements following _Leegin_ has led to tighter supplies and higher retail prices in the Rule
of Reason states.

Smith and MacKay (2013) recognize that higher prices by themselves do not necessarily
mean that consumers are worse off. In the absence of RPM agreements, retailers might not
hold sufficient inventory of high-cost branded goods as suggested above in Section 17.5
but, instead, hold more low-cost private label (unbranded) products. If this is so, then the
market share of branded products in the Rule of Reason states should have increased after
_Leegin_ relative to that in the _per se_ states. Yet Smith and MacKay (2013) estimate a second
difference-in-difference effect to show that this has _not_ been the case. In short, the Smith
and MacKay (2013) study offers fairly strong evidence that the relaxation of the _per se_
illegality rule for RPM agreements has led as many feared to less competitive pricing. Their
evidence from market simulations suggests that this has reduced consumer surplus by about
4 percent on average. [14]

difference-in-difference estimator is expected to be negative as actions that raise price lower the quantity
demanded. This too is exactly what they find to roughly the same extent that they find the positive price

**Summary**


Because a manufacturer relies on retailers to
get its goods to the market, the manufacturer
must hope that the retailers will share its views
about the appropriate price to consumers and the
proper amount of promotional and other services
to provide. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case.
Double-marginalization and other problems lead
to a divergence of interests between the manufacturer and the retailer. However, contractual
agreements governing this vertical relationship
can resolve some of these differences. Yet such
agreements can also facilitate price collusion
either among manufacturers or retailers. As a
result, public policy regarding vertical restraints
is complicated.

In this chapter, we have focused on one particular type of vertical restraint—a resale price
maintenance or RPM agreement. Such agreements may specify a maximum price above which
a retailer may not charge, or a minimum price
that the retailer cannot discount. For many years,
RPM agreements were considered anticompetitive and treated as _per se_ illegal. However,
starting as early as 1919, the courts have chipped
away at this strict view so that now RPM agreements and behavior that closely duplicates such
a contract even when the contract itself does
not formally specify a retail price, are subject
to a more flexible rule of reason. With _State_
_Oil v. Khan_ and with _Leegin_, the status of RPM
agreements has changed from _per se_ illegal to
legal if reasonably justified. This is true whether
the agreement imposes either a maximum or
minimum resale price.


**Problems**


1. Suppose that a car dealer has a local
monopoly in selling _Volvos_ . It pays _w_ to
_Volvo_ for each car that it sells, and charges
each customer _p_ . The demand curve that
the dealer faces is best described by the linear function _Q_ = 30 − _p,_ where the price
is in units of thousands of dollars.
a. What is the profit-maximizing price
for the dealer to set? At this price,
how many _Volvos_ will the dealer sell
and what will the dealer’s profit from
selling the cars be?



Vertical Price Restraints 481


The reason that the courts have moved to a
more lenient attitude toward RPM agreements
is straightforward. Increasingly, economists and
policy makers have understood that without
such agreements, problems such as doublemarginalization, insuring the provision of services to consumers, and dealing with demand
uncertainty, work against consumer as well as
producer interests. This is not to say that the
concern that vertical price restraints may be
anticompetitive is unwarranted. It does suggest,
though, that a proper adjudication of the issues
cannot be made until all the facts are known. In
some ways, this is exactly what the courts recognized in moving from a _per se_ illegal judgment
to one based on a “rule of reason.”

At the same time, the potential anticompetitive effects of RPM contracts are clear. Indeed,
the supposition that such effects are dominant
is heightened by the fact that historically, it has
been retailers and not manufacturers who have
lobbied most consistently against the _per se_ treatment that dominated the first century of antitrust
cases. It has also been these same retailers who
have supported legislation such as the MillerTydings and McGuire Acts permitting such vertical price restraints. Recent empirical work by
Smith and MacKay (2012) finds that the _Leegin_
case has led to higher product prices precisely
in those states that were predisposed to adopt
the more tolerant federal court guidelines suggests that these anticompetitive concerns may be
justified.


b. Now let us think about how the situation looks from the car manufacturer’s
point of view. If _Volvo_ charges _w_ per
car to its dealer, calculate how many
cars the dealer will buy from _Volvo_ . In
other words, what is the demand curve
facing _Volvo_ ? Suppose that it costs
_Volvo_ $5,000 to produce each car. What
is the profit-maximizing choice of w?
What will _Volvo’s_ profits be? What
price _p_ will the dealer set and what
profit will the dealer earn at _Volvo’s_

an intuitive explanation for why the

b. Suppose instead that _Volvo_ can impose
an RPM agreement on its independent

_Volvo_ actually set?

competitive retailers. It faces a constant

ABC’s profit? What retail price will
this imply?

MANUFACTURER’S OPTIMAL CONTRACT WHEN SELLING TO A
PRICE-DISCRIMINATING RETAILER


We consider the optimal wholesale price _r_ and fixed fee _T_ that a manufacturer should
select to maximize total profit when the retailer sells in two identical markets, one of which
is a monopoly but the other of which is constrained by potential entry to sell at a price
equal to the wholesale price. Given that there is competition in one market, _T_ = 0 _,_ as any
value of _T >_ 0 would drive competitive retailers from the market. The problem is then
the profit-maximizing choice for the wholesale price _r_ . Recall that demand in each market
is given by: _P_ = A–B _Q_ . Manufacturing cost is _c_ . The retail cost is just _r_ . Retailer profit
maximization in the monopoly case implies:



_QM_ = _[A]_ 2 [ −] _B_ _[r]_



(17.A1)
2 _B_



and a retail price _P_ _[D]_ of



_P_ _[D]_ _[A]_ [ +] _[ r]_ (17.A2)
= 2



The retailer’s profit _�_ _[R]_ in this market will therefore be:




_[R]_ _M_ [=] _[(A]_ [ −] 4 _B_ _[r)]_ [2]




_�_ _[R]_



(17.A3)
4 _B_


484 Contractual Relations Between Firms


Absent any franchise fee _T,_ the manufacturer’s profit _�_ _[M]_ _M_ [derived from sales in the retailer’s]

monopoly market will be:




_[M]_ _M_ [=] _[(r]_ [ −] _[c)(A]_ 2 _B_ [ −] _[r)]_




_�_ _[M]_



(17.A4)
2 _B_



In the competitive market, the price to consumers will be _r_ and retail profit is zero.
Output will be given by:

_QC_ = _[A]_ [ −] _B_ _[r]_ (17.A5)

The manufacturer’s profit _�_ _[M]_ _C_ [from the retailer’s sales in this competitive market is:]




_[M]_ _C_ [=] _[(r]_ [ −] _[c)(A]_ _B_ [ −] _[r)]_




_�_ _[M]_



(17.A6)
_B_



For a given _r_ at which retailers buy goods in both markets, the total manufacturer
combined profits are:



(17.A7)




_[c)(A]_ [ −] _[r)]_ _[(A]_ [ −] _[r)]_ [2]

2 _B_ + 4 _B_




_�_ _�_ _[M]_ _C_
=




_[M]_ _C_ _M_

[+] _[ �][M]_




_[M]_ _M_ [+] _[(A]_ [ −] 4 _B_ _[r)]_ [2]




[ −] _[r)]_ _[(r]_ [ −] _[c)(A]_ [ −] _[r)]_

4 _B_ = _B_




[ −] _[r)]_ _[(r]_ [ −] _[c)(A]_ [ −] _[r)]_

_B_ + 2 _B_



4 _B_



Maximizing this with respect to _r_ yields the following necessary condition:


_r_ [4] _[A]_ [ +][ 6] _[c]_ (17.A8)
= 10

with _A_ = 100 and _c_ = $20 _,_ this yields the value of _r_ = $52.0 reported in the text.


EFFICIENT SERVICE PROVISION AND PROFIT MAXIMIZATION
AT THE INTEGRATED FIRM


Total surplus from services is {A–[ _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ ]} [2] _(Ns)/_ 2. The surplus-maximizing or efficient
value of services _s_ [∗] must therefore satisfy:


_(_ A– _c)/_ 2 = _ϕ(s_ [∗] _)/_ 2 + _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ [∗] _)s_ [∗] _._ (17.A9)

The integrated firm’s profit is:


_π(p, s)_ = _p(A_  - _p)Ns_  - [ _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ ] _(A_  - _p)Ns_ (17.A10)

Necessary conditions for maximizing the integrated firm’s profit are then the joint first-order
conditions:


_∂π(p, s)_

_(A_ 2 _p)Ns_ [ _c_ _ϕ(s)_ ] _Ns_ 0 (17.A11)
_∂p_ =   - + + =


Vertical Price Restraints 485


and


_∂π(p, s)_

_p(A_ _p)N_ [ _c_ _ϕ(s)_ ] _(A_ _p)N_ _Nsϕ_ _(s)(A_ _p)_ 0 (17.A12)
_∂s_ =   -   - +   -   - ′   - =

Equation (17.A11) implies _p_ [I] = [ _A_ + _c_ + _ϕ(s)_ ] _/_ 2. Substituting this price into (17.A12)
yields:


_(A_  - _c)/_ 2 = _ϕ(s_ _[I]_ _)/_ 2 + _φ_ ′ _(s_ _[I]_ _)s_ _[I]_ (17.A13)

The service level satisfying (17.A13) is the same as that satisfying (17.A9), that is, _s_ _[I]_ = _s_ [∗] .


SERVICE PROVISION AND PROFIT MAXIMIZATION BY
COMPETITIVE RETAILERS


At any retail price _p_ = _r_ + _ϕ(s)_ consumer surplus is { _A_ –[ _r_ + _ϕ(s)_ ]} [2] _Ns/_ 2. Maximizing
this with respect to _s_ then yields the service level under competitive retailing, _s_ _[C]_


_(_ A– _r)/_ 2 = _ϕ(s_ _[C]_ _)/_ 2 + _ϕ_ ′ _(s_ _[C]_ _)s_ _[C]_ (17.A14)

Because _r > c_ and _ϕ_ ′ _>_ 0 _, s_ _[C]_ _< s_ _[I]_ = _s_ [∗] . Competitive retailers provide less service than
either the integrated firm or the socially optimal level.


# **18** **Non-Price Vertical Restraints**

In May 2012, Penn State University completed an agreement that assigned Pepsi the
exclusive “pouring rights” at every fountain and vending machine at each of the university’s
nineteen campuses across the state of Pennsylvania. For the next ten years, the only soft
drinks served at every athletic event, theatrical performance, university ceremony, and in
every university-authorized dining service, snack bar, and vending machine at every Penn
State school will be _Pepsi Cola_ and other Pepsi products such as _Mountain Dew_, _Lipton_
iced teas, _SoBe_, _Aquafina_, _Propel Zero_, and _Gatorade_ . The agreement followed a similar
agreement between Pepsi and the University of Delaware, and is one of a number university
“pouring rights” contracts that Pepsi has collected. Coca-Cola plays this game, too. It has
recently concluded similar exclusive beverage contracts with the University of Minnesota
and Ohio State University. These cola wars do not stop at the college level. By some
estimates, 80 percent of public schools have exclusive “pouring contracts” with either Coke
or Pepsi, and these extend not just to vending machines, cafeterias, and sports events but
even to the drinks offered at fundraisers such as bake sales and book fairs. [1]

The “pouring rights” contracts between schools and beverage companies are examples of
non-price vertical restraints. In this case, the upstream manufacturer imposes a restriction on
the downstream distributor. As noted in the previous chapter, non-price vertical constraints
are traditionally analyzed separately from vertical price restrictions (and historically treated
differently in the courts). Whether or not this distinction is legitimate, there is little doubt
that non-price restraints are the more common. Lafontaine and Slade (2007) estimate that
some sort of exclusive dealing covers one-third of sales by independent retailers in the US.
Other non-price vertical restraints such as exclusive territories are also frequently observed.
Yet while they have typically been analyzed separately, it is readily apparent that non-price
restrictions raise basically the same issues as the vertical price restrictions present. On the
one hand, these restrictions can serve as useful arrangements that enhance product quality
(including services) and efficiency. On the other hand, they have an obvious potential for
weakening competition. In this chapter we focus on the main vertical restrictions: exclusive
dealing, exclusive selling and territories, and aftermarket restrictions.

Non-Price Vertical Restraints 487


18.1 UPSTREAM COMPETITION AND EXCLUSIVE DEALING


As the soft drink and school examples above illustrate, exclusive dealing is a contractual
agreement that restricts the behavior of the retailer. Essentially, the retailer is not allowed to
buy (and then resell) brands that may compete with those of the manufacturer. Justifications
for exclusive dealing agreements are typically based on the presence of conflicting interests
between the manufacturer and the retailer. Unless some vertical restrictions can be imposed,
such conflicts may lead to outcomes that hurt consumers as well as firms.

To understand this concern, we should first recognize that manufacturers often expend
considerable resources promoting their products. Household products companies such as
Procter and Gamble, cosmetic manufacturers such as Revlon, and appliance firms such as
Whirlpool/Maytag, are just some of the many manufacturers that extensively advertise their
products. Such advertisements may well increase demand for the manufacturer’s brand.
They may also increase demand for the product category in general.

Consider, for example, advertisements for _Tylenol_, the well-known non-aspirin pain
reliever. Undoubtedly, such advertising helps raise the consuming public’s awareness of
both _Tylenol_, in particular, and of the benefits of non-aspirin pain relievers in general.
Such advertising is expensive. To recover the cost of the advertising, Johnson & Johnson,
_Tylenol’s_ manufacturer will have to raise _Tylenol’s_ price. We can easily imagine the
following transaction between a pharmacy owner and a customer searching for _Tylenol_ .
When asked why she wants _Tylenol_ the consumer will say because she needs non-aspirin
medication for pain and fever. The pharmacist may say that _Tylenol_ will work fine but that
the pharmacy also can offer a lower-cost, unadvertised brand that is the chemical equivalent
of _Tylenol_ . The price of this alternative may not be a lot below the _Tylenol_ price—just
enough to persuade the customer to switch to this brand.

It is precisely because the pharmacist can sell the alternative non-aspirin pain reliever at
a price relatively close to the price of _Tylenol_ that the pharmacist has an incentive to inform
the consumer of the alternative. From the perspective of _Tylenol_, however, the pharmacist
is free riding on _Tylenol’s_ advertising. _Tylenol_ now makes no sale even though it was
the _Tylenol_ advertising that may have induced the customer to ask for a non-aspirin pain
reliever in the first place. There is then a vertical externality in which actions by the retailer
have consequences that can adversely affect the manufacturer and vise-versa.

An exclusive dealing agreement offers a solution to this problem because it permits the
manufacturer to prevent the retailers of its product from making such substitutions. [2] This
is particularly important in the case of goods in which the retailer plays a role something
similar to that of a doctor whose recommendation acts like an informal guarantee of the
product’s quality. Many intermediate goods sold between firms, e.g., chemical products,
may have this feature. At the retail consumer level, automobile dealers are among retailers
who may serve this function.

From an antitrust perspective, however, exclusive dealing can also be a means of
suppressing competition. We showed in Chapter 13 one way that this could happen.
There we discussed the Rasmussen, Ramseyer, and Wiley (1991) model illustrating how
exclusive dealing requirements can prevent entry when there are important scale economies
in upstream production. However, entry prevention is not the only way that exclusive
dealing can limit competition. Such contracts can also be used to limit competition between


2 Marvel (1982) is among those who have stressed this argument.


488 Contractual Relations Between Firms


existing manufacturers. Foreclosure of a rival’s product can give a manufacturer increased
market power. [3]

The manufacturer will have to share the profit from that power with the retailer. In order
to get the exclusive contract in the first place, a manufacturer will have to offer the retailer as
much profit as its rival can offer. As Mathewson and Winter (1987) show, this consideration
can greatly complicate the analysis of exclusive dealing. In particular, the manufacturer
that gets the exclusive contract may only do so by offering to sell to the retailer at a very
low wholesale price. In turn, this low wholesale price will translate into a low retail price.
One issue is whether the fall in the retail price is sufficient to compensate consumers for
the loss of the alternative products. In principle, welfare could improve despite the fact that
the exclusive deal eliminates a rival product line from the market. [4]

Exclusive dealing can also serve to limit competition among retailers and manufactures,
simultaneously. For example, suppose that there are two manufacturers selling to two
retailers who are spatially separated but still operate within a given territory. Without any
exclusive dealing, each retailer may offer both products. As a result, price competition
between the two products or interbrand competition, will be quite fierce at each retail
location. However, if each manufacturer signs one of the retailers to sell its product by
means of an exclusive contract, then interbrand competition can be softened. Effectively,
the exclusive dealing does not foreclose either good but it does inject an element of spatial
differentiation between the two goods that did not previously exist. [5]


18.2 EXCLUSIVE SELLING AND TERRITORIAL ARRANGEMENTS


We now turn to a different aspect of exclusive selling that relates to territorial restrictions.
These cases differ from our soft drink and school example in two important respects.
Whereas the restrictions in that example were aimed at limiting _interbrand_ competition
between rival soft drink companies, exclusive selling and territorial arrangements are
aimed at limiting _intrabrand_ competition between downstream dealers. In this case, the
manufacturer agrees not to sell the product through other retailers. For example, under
an exclusive selling agreement, Wal-Mart might obtain the rights to be the only retailer
permitted to sell Nuance speech recognition software _Dragon_ . Similarly, in an exclusive
territorial arrangement, Toyota may sign agreements with a number of Lexus dealers that
it will not open a new outlet in within a given distance of these dealers. Note that in both
cases, the restriction now falls on the upstream firm.

We know that retail competition can help manufacturers in so far as it reduces or
even eliminates the double-marginalization problem. We may well wonder then why a
manufacturer would ever sign a contract that limits such retail competition. However, the
rationale behind such restrictions is relatively intuitive.


3 The foreclosure analysis here and in Section 18.3 overlaps with models from Chapter 16. Similarly, the
weakened price competition achieved by RPM agreements overlaps with our Chapter 14 analysis.
4 The foreclosure argument has been a recurrent topic in industrial organization. Bernheim and Whinston
(1990) show that when there are two brands produced by two upstream firms and a single retailer, there are
no incentives to adopt exclusive dealing. The retailer will always be a common dealer of both products. In
the case of several retailers, O’Brien and Schaffer (1994) and Besanko and Perry (1994) find that exclusive
dealing is always adopted. However, in the last two models, foreclosure is explicitly ruled out.
5 See Besanko and Perry (1994) for a model along these lines.
