### **11** **Dynamic Games and First and Second Movers**

In 2007, Apple introduced its first _iPhone_ . While other advanced, wireless phones already
existed (principally, RIM’s _Blackberry_ ), the _iPhone_ was the first to allow input through a
multi-touch screen rather than with a stylus or keypad, and the first to be compatible with
downloadable applications. Its music playing and web browsing capacities were also far
superior to anything that then existed. In short, this was the first of the modern “smart”
phones.

Competition was not long in coming. In 2008, Google released the operating system
_Android_ as an open-source platform available to other hardware and software producers.
T-Mobile was first with its _HTC Dream_ phone but Motorola and Samsung soon began
marketing their own _Android_ -based phones. As this text is being written, Apple still
retains its dominant position (within the United States, at least) as the leading smartphone
manufacturer. However, the _Android_ operating system now powers more smartphones
across all manufacturers combined. [1]

An essential feature of the above strategic interaction between Apple and its rivals is
its sequential nature. That is, unlike the simultaneous games discussed in the previous
two chapters, this rivalry evolved dynamically over time. First, Apple took an action, and
then—after that action was taken and observed—its rivals, principally Google, responded
with their own action. Such dynamic games are the focus of this chapter. In principal,
these games can have many rounds of play, sometimes called stages. Here, we concentrate
mostly on games with just two stages and, for convenience, just two firms. Typically, one
firm will play in the first round, the first mover, and the other will play in the second round,
the second mover.

Popular business literature is replete with stories about first movers. [2] Many of these
focus on specific cases in which, like the Apple smartphone example, the first mover is an
early entrant who gains a dominant position and subsequently faces competition from later
entrants. In the late nineteenth century, for example, Campbell’s emerged as the dominant
maker of canned soup in North America. Similarly, Heinz was the first entrant in the UK
canned-soup market. Later, Campbell’s entered the UK market after Heinz, and similarly
Heinz entered the US market after Campbell’s. Yet the first mover in each market continues

Dynamic Games and First and Second Movers 265


to dominate. Campbell’s has roughly 63 percent of the US market, but only 9 percent of
the UK market, whereas Heinz has a 41 percent market share in the United Kingdom and a
relatively minor market share in the United States. [3]

Sequential entry and dynamic games merit explicit economic analysis, partly because
they are so common but also because, as the Campbell’s and Heinz cases illustrate, they
suggest important advantages for the first entrant into a market in facing competition from
later entrants. Remember, entry is a key part of the competitive market’s success story as
an allocative mechanism. It is entry—or the threat of entry—that erodes the market power
of an established firm and that transforms otherwise monopolized markets into competitive
ones. This enforcement mechanism will, however, be weakened if there is any asymmetry
between established firms and later rivals. Understanding such asymmetry is therefore an
important issue in industrial economics.

In the next two chapters, we explore the entry process in detail when the firms—the
entrants and the incumbents—are strategic players in the market place. At this juncture, the
point to realize is that entry is a sequential process—some firms enter early and some enter
late. Thus developing an understanding of dynamic games is good groundwork for our later
investigation of entry and entry deterrence in oligopoly markets.

We first examine quantity and price competition when firms move sequentially rather than
simultaneously. We will discover again that price and quantity competition are different,
and depending on the kind of competition, there can be first-mover or second-mover
advantages. This raises the interesting question of whether and how a firm can become
either a first- or second-mover. Often the key to achieving the desired position and the
associated higher profits is the ability of the firm to make a credible commitment to its
strategy when the market opens for trade. We examine what credibility means in game
theory and how it affects our equilibrium solution concept for dynamic models.

Simultaneous games, such as the traditional Cournot or Bertrand model, describe a
once-and-for-all market interaction between the rival firms. In some sequential games as
well there is only one market period where trade takes place, although this might occur
in several stages. However, the more likely scenario is that rival firms interact and trade
today in the market and then interact again in the future. Moreover, the competing firms
understand the likelihood of future interactions today. Repeating the market interaction
over and over again gives rise to a somewhat different type of dynamic game, usually called
a repeated game. We defer our discussion of repeated games until Chapter 14.


11.1 THE STACKELBERG MODEL OF QUANTITY COMPETITION


The duopoly model of Stackelberg (1934) is similar to the Cournot model except for one
critically important difference. The two firms now choose quantities _sequentially_ rather
than _simultaneously_ . The firm that moves first and chooses its output level first is the leader
firm. The firm that moves second is the follower firm. The sequential choice of output is
what makes the game dynamic. However, the firms trade their goods on the market only
once and their interaction yields a “once-and-for-all” market-clearing outcome.

Let market demand again be represented by a linear inverse demand function _P_ =
_A_ - _BQ_ . Firm 1 is the leader who moves first and firm 2 is the follower who chooses
its output _after_ the choice of the leader is made. Each firm has the same constant unit


3 See, for example, Sutton (1991).


266 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


cost of production _c_ . Total industry output _Q_ equals the sum of the outputs of each firm,
_Q_ _q_ 1 _q_ 2.
=Firm 1 acts first and chooses + _q_ 1. How should it make this choice? Both firms are rational

and strategic and both firms know this, and know that each other knows this. As a result,
firm 1 will make its choice taking into account its best guess as to firm 2’s rational response
to its choice of _q_ 1. In other words, firm 1 will work out firm 2’s best response to each value
of _q_ 1 _,_ incorporate that best response into its own decision-making, and then choose the _q_ 1
which, given firm 2’s best response, maximizes firm 1’s profit.

We can solve for firm 2’s best response function _q_ 2 [∗] [exactly as we did in the Cournot]

model in Chapter 9. For any choice of output _q_ 1 _,_ firm 2 faces the inverse demand and
marginal revenue curves:


_P_ _(A_ _Bq_ 1 _)_ _Bq_ 2
=  -  
_MR_ 2 _(A_ _Bq_ 1 _)_ 2 _Bq_ 2 (11.1)
=   -   
Setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost yields firm 2’s best response _q_ 2 [∗] [as the]

solution to the first-order condition:


_A_ _Bq_ 1 2 _Bq_ 2 [∗] (11.2)

If firm 1 is rational, firm 1will understand that equation (11.3) describes what firm 2 will

do in response to each possible choice of _q_ 1. We can summarize equation (11.3) by _q_ 2 [∗] _[(q]_ 1 _[)]_ [.]

Anticipating this behavior by firm 2, firm 1 can substitute _q_ 2 [∗] _[(q]_ 1 _[)]_ [ for] _[ q]_ 2 [in its demand]

_P_ _A_ _Bq_ 2 [∗]

In turn, this implies that its profit function is:

Note that this substitution results in firm 1’s demand and profits being dependent only on
its own output choice, _q_ 1. This is because firm 1 effectively sets _q_ 2 as well, by virtue of
the fact that _q_ 2 is chosen by firm 2 in response to _q_ 1 according to firm 2’s best response
function, _and firm 1 anticipates this_ . In other words, the first-mover correctly predicts the
second-mover’s best response and incorporates this prediction into its decision-making
calculus.

(11.3), which yields:

(11.7)
4 _B_



Together, equations (11.6) and (11.7) describe the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium production levels of each firm. Note that the leader’s output is exactly equal to the level of
output chosen by a simple uniform-pricing monopolist. This is a well-known feature of the
Stackelberg model when demand is linear and costs are constant.



The total industry production is of course the sum of the two outputs shown in



equations (11.6) and (11.7). This sum is: _Q_ _[S]_ [3] _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_
= 4 _B_



. Compare this market output
4 _B_



with the earlier Cournot-Nash equilibrium industry output _Q_ _[C]_ [2] _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_
= 3 _B_



with the earlier Cournot-Nash equilibrium industry output _Q_ _[C]_ . Clearly, the
= 3 _B_

Stackelberg model yields a greater industry output. Accordingly, the equilibrium price is
lower in the Stackelberg model than it is in the Cournot model. The price and output results
are illustrated in Figure 11.1.

A central feature of the Stackelberg model is the difference in the relative outcome of
the two firms. Recall that from the standpoint of both consumer preferences and production
techniques, the firms are identical. They produce identical goods and do so at the same
constant unit cost. Yet, because one firm moves first, the outcome for the two firms is
different. Comparing _q_ 1 [∗] [and] _[ q]_ 2 [∗] [reveals that the leader gets a far larger market share and]



1 [∗] [and] _[ q]_ 2 [∗]



different. Comparing _q_ 1 [∗] [and] _[ q]_ 2 [∗] [reveals that the leader gets a far larger market share and]

earns a much larger profit than does the follower. Moving first clearly has advantages.
Alternatively, entering the market late has its disadvantages.

268 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models



An interesting additional aspect of the disadvantaged outcome for firm 2 in the Stackelberg
model is that this outcome occurs even though firm 2 has full information regarding the
output choice of _q_ 1. Indeed, firm 2 actually observes that choice before selecting _q_ 2. In
the Cournot duopoly model, firm 2 did not have such concrete information. Because the
Cournot model is based upon simultaneous moves, each firm could only make a (rational)
guess as to its rival’s output choice. Paradoxically, firm 2 does worse when it has complete
information about firm 1’s choice (the Stackelberg case) than it does when its information
is less than perfect (the Cournot case). This is because saying the information is concrete
amounts to saying that firm 1’s choice—at the time that firm 2 observes it—is irreversible.
In the Stackelberg model, by the time firm 2 moves, firm 1 is already fully committed to

= 2 _B_

_q_ 2 _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_

[ −] _[c)]_

. In the Cournot context, _q_ 1 _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_
2 _B_ = 2 _B_



is _not_ a best response to the choice
2 _B_



_q_ 2 and so firm 2 would not anticipate that firm 1 would produce that quantity.
= 4 _B_

In contrast, in the Stackelberg model we do not derive firm 1’s choice as a best response to



_q_ 2 _[(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_
= 4 _B_





_q_ 2 . Instead, we derived firm 1’s output choice as the profit-maximizing output
= 4 _B_

when firm 1 correctly anticipates that firm 2’s decision is to choose its best value of _q_ 2
_conditional upon_ the output choice already made by firm 1. It is this fact that reflects the
underlying assumption of sequential moves that distinguishes the Stackelberg model.

Stackelberg’s modification to the basic Cournot model is important. It is a useful way to
capture the observed phenomenon that one firm often has a dominant or leadership position
in a market. The Stackelberg model reveals that moving first can have its advantage and
therefore can be an important aspect of strategic interaction.


the follower, observes the choice of _q_ 1 and then selects its own output _q_ 2. The resulting
price is one satisfying the industry demand curve _P_ 200 _q_ 1 _q_ 2. Both firms have zero
fixed costs and a constant marginal cost of 60. = - 
a. Derive the equation for the follower firm’s best response function. Draw this equation
on a graph with _q_ 2 on the vertical axis and _q_ 1 on the horizontal axis. Indicate the
vertical intercept, horizontal intercept, and slope of the best response function.
b. Determine the equilibrium output of each firm in the leader-follower game. Show that
this equilibrium lies on firm 2’s best response function. What are firm 1’s profits in the
equilibrium?
c. Now let the two firms choose their outputs simultaneously. Compute the Cournot
equilibrium outputs and industry price. Who loses and who gains when the firms play
a Cournot game instead of the Stackelberg one?


11.2 SEQUENTIAL PRICE COMPETITION


Now consider what happens if we keep the dynamic game framework above but change the
strategic variable from output to price. Otherwise, the model is exactly the same as before.
Each firm produces an identical good at the same, constant marginal cost, _c,_ and consumers
will purchase the good from the lowest-priced firm. If they set the same prices, then each
firm will serve half the market.


Dynamic Games and First and Second Movers 269


In setting its price, firm 1 must of course anticipate firm 2’s best response. Clearly firm
2 will have an incentive to price slightly below firm 1’s price whenever firm 1 sets a price
greater than unit cost _c_ and less than or equal to the monopoly price. In that case, by
undercutting, firm 2 will serve the entire market and earn all the potential profits. On the
other hand, if firm 1 sets a price less than unit cost _c,_ then firm 2 will not match or undercut
firm 1’s price because firm 2 has no interest in making any sales when each unit sold loses
money. Finally, if firm 1sets a price equal to unit cost _c,_ firm 2’s best response is to match
it. The anticipated behavior of firm 2 in stage 2 puts firm 1 in a tight bind. Any price greater
than unit cost _c_ results in zero sales and there is no sense in setting a price less than _c_ . The
best firm 1 can do then is set a price equal to unit cost _c_ . Firm 2’s best response in the next
stage is to match firm 1’s price.

As we saw in Chapter 10, however, matters are very different if the two firms are
not selling identical products. In this case, not all consumers buy from the lower-priced
firm. Product differentiation changes the outcome of price competition. To illustrate the
nature of price competition with differentiated products, recall the spatial model of product
differentiation that we developed previously. There is a product spectrum of unit length
along which consumers are uniformly distributed. Two firms supply this market. One firm
has the address or product design _x_ = 0 on the line whereas the other has location _x_ = 1.
Each of the firms has the same constant unit cost of production _c_ .

A consumer’s location in this market refers to the consumer’s most preferred product or
style. “Consumer _x_ ” is located distance _x_ from the left-hand end of the market. Consumers
differ regarding which variant or location of the good they consider to be the best, or
their ideal product, but are identical in their reservation price _V_ for their most preferred
product. We assume that the reservation price _V_ is substantially greater than the unit cost of
production _c_ . Each consumer buys at most one unit of the product. If consumer _x_ purchases
a good that is not the ideal product, a utility loss of _tx_ is incurred if good 1 (located at _x_ = 0)
is consumed; a utility loss of _t(_ 1 − _x)_ is incurred if good 2 (located at _x_ = 1) is incurred.

The two firms compete for customers by setting prices, _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 _,_ respectively. However,
unlike the simple Bertrand model, firm 1 sets its price _p_ 1 first, and then firm 2 follows by
setting _p_ 2. In order to find the demand facing the firms at prices _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 we proceed as in
the previous chapter by identifying the marginal consumer _x_ _[m]_ _,_ who is indifferent between
buying from either firm 1 or firm 2. Indifference means that consumer _x_ _[m]_ gets the same
consumer surplus from either product and so satisfies the condition:


_V_ _p_ 1 _tx_ _[m]_ _V_ _p_ 2 _t(_ 1 _x_ _[m]_ _)_ (11.8)
  -  - =  -  -  
From equation (11.8) we find that the address of the marginal consumer _x_ _[m]_ is:


_x_ _[m]_ _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _[(p]_ [2][ −] _[p]_ [1][ +] _[ t)]_ (11.9)
= 2 _t_


At any set of prices, _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 _,_ all consumers to the left of _x_ _[m]_ buy from firm 1, and all
those to the right of _x_ _[m]_ buy from firm 2. In other words, _x_ _[m]_ is the fraction of the market
buying from firm 1 and _(_ 1 − _x_ _[m]_ _)_ is the fraction buying from firm 2. If the total number of
consumers is denoted by _N_ and they are uniformly distributed over the product spectrum,
the demand function facing firm 1 at any price combination _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ is:

_D_ [1] _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _x_ _[m]_ _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _[(p]_ [2][ −] _[p]_ [1][ +] _[ t)]_ _N_ (11.10)
= = 2 _t_


270 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


Similarly, firm 2’s demand function is:

_D_ [2] _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _)_ _(_ 1 _x_ _[m]_ _(p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _))_ _[(p]_ [1][ −] _[p]_ [2][ +] _[ t)]_ _N_ (11.11)
= =  - = 2 _t_

Firm 1 acts first and sets its price _p_ 1. In doing so, firm 1 anticipates firm 2’s best response
to the price _p_ 1 that firm 1 sets. In other words, firm 1 works out firm 2’s best response to
each possible price _p_ 1 _,_ and then chooses its profit-maximizing price _p_ 1 given firm 2’s best
response to that price. We can solve for firm 2’s best response function _p_ 2 [∗] [exactly as we]

did in Section 3 of Chapter 10 [equation (10.14)]. It is

Firm 1 knows that equation (11.12) describes what firm 2 will do in response to each

sequential game. Both firms now charge higher prices but the prices are no longer equal. [=] _[ p]_ [∗] [=] _[ c]_ [ +] _[ t]_ [, and each served half the market. Things change, however, in the]
The price leader, firm 1, now sets a higher price than the follower, firm 2. As a result, firm
2 now serves the larger market share—5/8 relative to the 3/8 served by firm 1.

Note that firm 1’s price leadership has helped both firms. In the simultaneous game, each
earned a profit of _Nt_ /2. Now, firm 1 earns a profit equal to 9 _Nt_ /16, while firm 2 earns an
even greater profit equal to 25 _Nt_ /32. That is, while both firms are better off under the price
leadership game (and consumers are worse off), it is the second or follower firm that gains
the most. There is then an important first-mover _dis_ advantage in this price game. Once firm
1 commits to a price, it becomes a fixed target for firm 2 to undercut. Yet because goods are
differentiated it is difficult for firm 2 to steal all of firm 1’s customers unless it prices really


Dynamic Games and First and Second Movers 271


low. Knowing that this is not profitable and that firm 2 will therefore not undercut its price
too much is what leads firm 1 to set a fairly high—and more profitable—price to begin
with. If consumers regarded the goods as perfect substitutes so that the parameter _t_ = 0 _,_
prices would again fall to marginal cost as in the original Bertrand model, and there would
be no first- or second-mover advantage.


at the east end of town, _x_ = 0 _,_ and the other is located at the east end, _x_ = 1. There are
100 potential customers who live along the mile stretch, and they are uniformly spread out
along the mile. Consumers are willing to pay $50 for a haircut done at their home. If a
consumer has to travel there and back to get a haircut then a travel cost of $5 per mile is
incurred. Each salon has the same unit cost equal to $10 per haircut.


a. Suppose the East End Salon posts its price for a haircut first and then the West End
Salon posts its price for a haircut. What prices will the two salons set? How many
customers does each salon serve? What are the profits?
b. Compare the prices to the ones we found when the two salons set their prices
simultaneously [Chapter 10, equation (10.15)]. Explain why prices changed in the way
they did.


Firms generally seem to do better when they compete sequentially in prices than when
they compete sequentially in output. The average price is higher and both firms earn
higher profits when price competition is sequential rather than simultaneous. In contrast, the
industry price falls and only one firm earns higher profit when quantity competition becomes
sequential rather than simultaneous. This difference is related to another distinction: whereas
it is the first mover who has the clear advantage in the quantity game, in the price game, it
is the firm who moves last that does best. [4]

It is important to understand the central reason that the dynamic games above yield
such different outcomes from their simultaneous counterparts. Again, the reason is that
sequential play means that when the follower moves, firm 1’s move is taken as irreversible
or given. To put it differently, the game only becomes truly sequential if firm 1 can make
a _credible commitment_ not to alter its choice after firm 2 has played. If for example, firm
1 could alter its output or price after firm 2 moves, the Nash equilibrium in either the
output or price games discussed above would be the same as in the simultaneous games
of Chapters 9 and 10. Because credibility is so important, we should expect that the firms
playing dynamic games will also distinguish between credible strategies and non-credible
ones. So, we need to understand what makes strategies credible in dynamic games.

We explore dynamic credibility in the next section. We do so in the context of a
market entry game. This is a game that has been of great interest to industrial organization
economists. In this game, the incumbent firm announces a strategy promising its reaction
to actual entry. The entrant then moves by deciding whether or not to enter, taking account
the incumbent’s threatened reaction. The question is what threats are credible.


4 This would not be the case if the market were instead vertically differentiated and the first mover was also
the firm with the highest quality good.

11.3 CREDIBILITY OF THREATS AND NASH EQUILIBRIA
FOR DYNAMIC GAMES


We begin by introducing a concept that is critical to all dynamic games, namely, that of a
subgame. A subgame is a part of an entire game that can stand alone as a game in itself. A
proper subgame is a game within a game. Simultaneous games cannot have subgames, but
dynamic games can. An example of a subgame in a two period model is the competition in
the second period, which is a one-shot game within the larger two-period game.

Closely related to the notion of subgame is the concept of subgame perfection, first
introduced by Nobel Prize winner Reinhard Selten (1978). It is the concept of subgame
perfection that permits us to understand whether a firm’s strategy is credible in a dynamic


Dynamic Games and First and Second Movers 273


game. The term sounds very technical but it is actually quite simple. Basically, subgame
perfection means that if a strategy chosen at the start of a game is optimal, it must be
optimal to stick with that strategy at every later juncture in the game as play progresses.

It is easier to understand the concept of subgame perfection by seeing its application
in practice. Imagine then a dynamic game between two software firms, one a giant called
Microhard who is the incumbent firm in the market and the other an upstart firm, Newvel,
who wishes to enter the market. In this game the potential entrant, Newvel, chooses either
to enter Microhard’s market or to stay out. If Newvel stays out it earns a normal profit
from being somewhere else in the economy, say _�_ = 1 _,_ and Microhard continues to earn
a monopoly profit in the software market, say _�_ = 5. If Newvel enters the market then
Microhard can choose either to accommodate the new entrant and share the market or to
fight the new entrant by slashing prices. If Microhard accommodates Newvel’s entry, then
each firm earns a profit _�_ = 2. If, on the other hand, Microhard fights, then neither firm
makes any profit so each firm earns _�_ = 0.

Dynamic games with moves in sequence require more care in presentation than singleperiod, simultaneous games. In a simultaneous game, a firm moves once and simultaneously
and so its _action_ is the same as its _strategy_ . For a dynamic game, a firm’s strategy is a
complete set of instructions that tell the firm what _actions_ to pick at every conceivable
situation in the game. However, we can begin the analysis of this entry game between
Microhard and Newvel using a payoff matrix of the type introduced in Chapter 9. For the
game at hand, this matrix is shown in Table 11.1.

Start with the combination (Enter, Fight). This _cannot_ correspond to an equilibrium.
Enter will lead Newvel to come into the market. If Microhard has adopted the Fight strategy,
it must respond to such an entry very aggressively. Yet, as the payoff matrix makes clear,
such an aggressive action is not Microhard’s best response to entry by Newvel. Now try
(Enter, Accommodate). This _is_ a Nash equilibrium in strategies. If Newvel chooses to
Enter and if Microhard has adopted the strategy, Accommodate, the associated outcome
is a best response for both Newvel and Microhard. That is, if Microhard has adopted
a strategy to Accommodate, then Enter is the best response for Newvel and if Newvel
enters accommodating is a best response for Microhard. Therefore the combination (Enter,
Accommodate) is a Nash equilibrium.

What about the combination (Stay Out, Fight)? It also satisfies the Nash definition. If
Newvel chooses Stay Out, then the Fight strategy is a best response for Microhard, while
if Microhard has chosen its Fight strategy, then Stay Out is a best response for Newvel.
Therefore, (Stay Out, Fight) is also a Nash equilibrium in strategies. We leave it for the
reader to show that the strategy combination (Stay Out, Accommodate) is not a Nash
equilibrium.

Again, it is important to understand that a Nash equilibrium is defined in terms of
strategies that are best responses to each other. In the second Nash equilibrium (Stay Out,
Fight), Microhard never actually takes or implements a fighting action. Instead, it relies

274 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


fully on the _threat_ to do so as a device to deter Newvel from entering. The Nash equilibrium
concept is not based on what actions are actually observed in the market place, but rather
upon what thinking or strategizing underlies what we observe. This is what is meant when
we say we need to define a Nash equilibrium in terms of firms’ strategies.

It appears then that there are two Nash equilibria to this game. There is, however,
something troubling about one of these, namely, the Nash equilibrium (Stay Out, Fight). It
is true that if Microhard has fully committed itself to the strategy, “Fight,” then Newvel’s
best strategy is “Stay Out.” But Newvel might question whether such a commitment is
really possible. By adopting the Fight strategy, Microhard essentially says to Newvel, “I
am going to price high as long as you stay out, but, if you enter my market, I will cut my
price and smash you.” The problem is that this threat suffers a serious _credibility_ problem.
We already know that once Newvel has entered the market, taking action to fight back
is not in Microhard’s best interest. It does much better by accommodating such an entry.
Consequently, Microhard does not have an incentive to carry out its threat. So, why should
Newvel believe that threat in the first place?

What we have really just discovered is that any Nash equilibrium strategy combination
based on non-credible threats is not very satisfactory. This means that we need to strengthen
our definition of Nash equilibrium to rule out such strategy combinations. This is where the
notion of subgame perfection, or a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, becomes important.
A Nash equilibrium is considered to be subgame perfect only if at that point in the game
when a player is called upon to make good on a promise or a threat, doing exactly that
and fulfilling the promise or threat is what would be the player’s best response. In other
words, if any promises or threats are made in one period, carrying them out is still part of a
Nash equilibrium in a later period should the occasion arise to do so. If Microhard adopts
a strategy that includes the threat of a fight if entry occurs, then if the strategy is subgame
perfect it must be optimal for Microhard to fight in the event that Newvel enters, i.e., in the
subgame set in period 2 after Newvel has made its entry decision. Because it is not, any
outcome that includes Fight cannot be part of a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.

Generally speaking, it is more difficult to test for subgame perfection using the matrix
representation of the game. This is the reason we originally found two Nash equilibria
in the game above. For dynamic games, we prefer instead to use an extensive or tree
representation of the game.

The extensive form of a game is comprised of branches, nodes, and vectors of payoffs.
The nodes are the decision points of the game. The extensive form of the entry game
between Newvel and Microhard is shown in Figure 11.2. Here, the nodes are labeled N
(Newvel) or M (Microhard), depending on which firm makes the move at that position. The

Newvel

branches that are drawn from a node represent the choice of actions available to the player
at that node. Each branch points either to another node, where further action takes place,
or to a vector of payoffs (Newvel’s payoff shown first), which means that this particular
action has ended the game. Finally, at any node players know about the course of play that
has led to that node.

When we represent a sequential game in extensive form it is easy to identify a subgame.
A subgame is defined as a single node and all the actions that flow from that node. In the
extensive game illustrated in Figure 11.2, there are two subgames. There is the full game
starting from node _N_ 1 (the full game is always a subgame). Then there is the subgame
starting at node _M_ 2 _,_ and including all subsequent actions that flow from this node. A
strategy combination is subgame perfect if the strategy for each player is a best response
against the strategies of the other players for every subgame of the entire game. In the case
at hand, it is readily apparent that for the subgame beginning at node _M_ 2, the best response
strategy for Microhard is Accommodate and _not_ Fight. Hence, the strategy combination
(Stay Out, Fight) cannot correspond to a subgame perfect equilibrium. The only such
equilibrium in this case is that of (Enter, Accommodate).

There is an important technique for solving games with a finite number of nodes. In such
games, the simplest way to identify the subgame perfect equilibria is to work backwards,
eliminating branches that will not be taken until we have reduced the game tree to having a
single branch from each node. This takes advantage of the property that a subgame perfect
equilibrium strategy combination must be a Nash equilibrium in each subgame. In our
example, we start at node _M_ 2. We have already seen that we can eliminate the “Fight”
branch, leaving only the single “Accommodate” branch from node _M_ 2. Now pass down
the tree to node _N_ 1. Newvel now knows that Stay Out leads to a payoff of 1, while Enter
leads to _M_ 2 and to Accommodate by Microhard, giving Newvel a payoff of 2. So the Stay
Out branch can be eliminated. The game tree now has a single branch from _N_ 1 and a single
branch from _M_ 2 _,_ so we have solved the game. Newvel chooses to Enter and Microhard
chooses to Accommodate. In other words, this procedure has eliminated the combination
(Stay Out, Fight) as a perfect Nash equilibrium.


game is played as between two players, as follows. A neutral third party, call it Nature, puts
$1 on the table. Player 1 can either “grab” this dollar or “wait.” If player 1 takes the dollar,
the game is over and player 1 gets $1 and player 2 obviously gets nothing. However, it is
completely understood that, if player 1 waits, Nature will _triple_ the amount on the table to
$3. At that point, it becomes player 2’s turn to move. Player 2’s options are as follows:
either take the entire $3 or share the money equally with player 1.


a. Construct the 2 × 2 payoff matrix for this game taking player 1’s actions to be either
Grab or Wait, and player 2’s actions to be either Grab (the whole $3) or Share. Assume
the payoffs are equal to the amount of money the player receives.
b. Draw the game in its extensive form.
c. Suppose that player 2 promises player 1 to choose Share if player 1 chooses Wait. Is
this promise credible? Why or why not?

11.4 THE CHAIN STORE PARADOX


In the Microhard and Newvel game, there is just one market and one potential entrant,
and fighting the entrant was not an optimal response to entry. However, what if Microhard
faced more than one entrant? Perhaps fighting one entrant builds a reputation for aggressive
behavior that will scare off later entrants. The consideration of the reputational effects
of fighting may change Microhard’s optimal strategy. Taking predatory action against a
rival—costly though it is—could be useful _if_ it serves to make the threat credible against
_other_ rivals, either those in other markets or those who may appear later in time. If
we introduce this possibility into our example, could Microhard’s threat to fight become
credible because the subsequent gains in other markets from establishing a reputation as a
fighter are sufficiently large? In other words, could reputation effects make Fight credible
and the strategy combination (Stay Out, Fight) subgame perfect?

The fact that extension of the above game to many markets (distributed over time or
space) and to other rivals may _not_ lead to a different outcome is a famous result dubbed
by Selten as “The Chain-Store Paradox.” [5] To see the logic of this puzzling result, consider
a situation in which Microhard has established operating units in each of twenty markets,
perhaps twenty different cities. In each city, Microhard faces potential entry by a single,
small competitor. At the moment, none of these potential competitors has the capital to start
operations. However, as time goes on, one after another will raise the necessary funds. To
make matters simple, assume that the pay-offs in each of the twenty markets are just as in
the pay-off matrix of the previous section. The question facing Microhard is how to react
to this sequence of potential entrants. In particular, should Microhard adopt an aggressive
response to the first entrant and drive it out of business? Will this tactic earn Microhard a
reputation for ruthlessness such that subsequent entrants in its other markets will get the
message and choose not to enter?

Again, working backwards can help us identify a subgame perfect strategy. So, let’s start
with one possible scenario in which Microhard is facing the last potential entrant in the
final, twentieth market. It is possible that Microhard has followed through on its threat to cut
price and drive out any entrant not just in the first market, but also in all previous nineteen
markets. This is a possible path in the game and we are interested if such an aggressive
response to entry can convince the last potential entrant to stay out, so that Microhard would
be spared a fight in this final case.

However, consider the viewpoint of the entrant to the twentieth market. This firm will
realize that because there are no subsequent entrants, it is playing a game that is exactly
the one-period game we discussed above. Hence, this last entrant will understand that
Microhard has no incentive to Fight in this last market. Microhard’s profit is greater if it
follows a “live and let live” strategy in this last case [6] because it cannot gain from any
further demonstration of its ruthlessness. There are no other entrants left to impress! In
other words, (Enter, Accommodate) must be the Nash equilibrium for this final subgame.

One might think that just because Microhard cannot credibly deter entry in the twentieth
market, it is still possible to deter the entry of earlier rivals by means of the threat to Fight.
To see why this is not possible, however, consider the potential entrant in the nineteenth


5 Selten (1978). We have obviously limited ourselves here to consideration of finitely repeated games only.
Infinitely repeated games are considered in the next chapter.
6 Implicit here is the presumption that accommodating an entrant is in the short run more profitable than
engaging in a price war.


Dynamic Games and First and Second Movers 277


rather than the twentieth market. Once again, let’s take the extreme case in which Microhard
has taken predatory or fighting action in the prior eighteen markets. Now the potential
entrant in the nineteenth market can reason as well as we can. As a result, this firm will work
out the logic of the preceding case and rightfully conclude that Microhard will not fight in
the twentieth market. The entrant in the nineteenth or next-to-last market will then reason
as follows: “Microhard will let the last rival firm survive because it is more profitable to do
so. Yet this implies that both Microhard and I know that the entry of the last rival will not
be challenged no matter what happens in this, the nineteenth market. It follows then that
there is no reason for Microhard to act tough here. Its only reason to do so would be to
convince the entrant in the next market. Because this is not possible, the only justification
for fighting in market nineteen has been removed.” Once again, Microhard’s promise to
fight is not credible. It gains Microhard nothing by way of a demonstration to the next rival.
Absent such a reputation effect, Microhard’s best response to entry in the nineteenth market
is again to accommodate. Knowing this, the potential entrant in market nineteen will enter.

We can continue in this fashion repeatedly, bringing us back all the way to the initial
market. At every stage, we will find that a strategy to fight after entry occurs is not in
Microhard’s interest. Accordingly, any strategy that includes the threat to Fight if entry
occurs is not credible and therefore not subgame perfect. This is true at each node, from
that at the twentieth market to that at the nineteenth market, and so on all the way back to
the complete game starting with the very first market. Within this simple model, there is no
way for the incumbent to credibly threaten an aggressive low-price response to entry.

If this were the end of the story, our interest in the predatory conduct would certainly be
very low. Why should we worry about an event that presumably never occurs? The answer
is that there may be ways to make the threat to fight credible other than actual fighting,
itself. [7] In the next two chapters we will examine tactics by which firms may make their
predatory threats credible and deter entry significantly.


11.5 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: STACKELBERG BEATS
COURNOT


The oligopoly models studied in this and the previous chapters—Cournot, Bertrand, and
Stackelberg—are just that: They are models and therefore simplified abstractions of a very
complicated reality. Often students learning these models ask whether anyone really thinks
this way, i.e., whether anyone really works through the models to derive their optimal
choices in the way game theory implies.

It is difficult of course to understand or to prove exactly what happens inside someone’s
mind. However, we can make intelligent inferences about their thought process by observing
their behavior in different settings. A relatively recent method for doing this is to conduct
experiments with real people in a controlled setting. An example of such work is the paper
“Stackelberg Beats Cournot: On Collusion and Efficiency in Experimental Markets” by
Huck, M¨uller, and Normann (2001).

In brief, Huck, M¨uller, and Normann (2001) divide 134 students into pairs to play
simulated Cournot and Stackelberg two-person games. In each case, each of the two student
players is told that they are one of two firms, each of which must choose how much to

games. See also Tirole (1988) and Rasmusen (2007).


278 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


produce of an identical product at a constant marginal cost of _c_ = 6 _,_ and facing the inverse
market demand curve:


_P(Q)_ _P(q_ 1 _q_ 2 _)_ 30 _Q_ for _Q_ 30 otherwise 0 (11.17)
= + =    - ; ≤ ;

In the Stackelberg games, one student is assigned the role of follower and plays only after
observing the student assigned the leader role. In the Cournot games, each student chooses
without knowing the choice of the other so that play is effectively simultaneous. Before
the start of any game, players were also given a payoff table showing for each and every
possible strategy combination the profit to each firm as measured in a fictitious currency
called a “Taler.” A single game between two players actually consisted of ten rounds in
which the players would make the output choices ten successive times to allow for learning.
Player motivation to maximize profit was provided by the fact that players knew that two
of the ten rounds would be chosen at random and that they would then receive real money
(Euros) at the rate of one unit for every ten Talers of profit. In the results below, we focus
on the outcomes for games in which the rival players were assigned randomly before the
start of each complete game.

Given the demand and cost structure, you should recognize that the standard Stackelberg
outcome is for the leader to produce twelve units while the follower produces six, and
that the standard Cournot outcome is for each firm to produce eight units. In turn, these
outcomes also carry the implication that total output in the Stackelberg market will exceed
that in the Cournot market. What happened in the laboratory experiments?

Table 11.2 shows the average outcomes across the sample of games along with the
theoretical predictions for each scenario. A few findings are readily observable. First, the
outcomes in the Cournot experiments are very close to those predicted by economic theory,
with each Cournot student-firm typically choosing an output very close to eight units.
Second, the Stackelberg experiments yield results that, while still preserving the greater
output and first-mover advantage for the leader firm, depart somewhat from the Stackelberg
theoretical model in that the leader’s output is smaller than predicted while the follower’s
output is larger than predicted. Third, despite this latter finding, the typical Stackelberg
game nevertheless still results in more total output than the typical Cournot game, again as
theory predicts.

Huck M¨uller, and Normann (2001) explore the difference between the actual and
theoretical Stackelberg predictions somewhat further by first comparing the best-response
function implied by the actual players’ behavior with that predicted by theory. The latter

is of course: _qF_ 12 0.5 _qL_ . Using linear regression, the authors find that the followers
in their random pair experiments instead are best described as having a response function = given by:


_qF_ 10.275 0.178 _qL_ (11.18)
=  
The slope of this estimated behavior is much flatter than predicted, implying that follower
firms do not reduce their output as much as predicted in response to an output choice by the
leader. For example, at the predicted leader output of 12, the response function in (11.18)
implies a follower output of 8.35—well above the 6 units predicted by the theoretical best
response function.

In short, Huck, M¨uller, and Normann (2001) find that followers are more aggressive than
theory predicts. They hypothesize then that this is because followers have an _inequality_
_aversion_ in that they care not just about their own profit but also about the inequality
between the profits of the leader and the follower. In particular, the authors suggest that
instead of maximizing profit, follower players may instead be maximizing the following
utility function:


_U(πF_ _, πL)_ _πF_ _α_ max _(πL_ _πF_ _,_ 0 _)_ _β_ max _(πF_ _πL,_ 0 _)_ (11.19)
=      -      -      -      
Here _α_ and _β_ are typically taken to be positive fractions. Thus, equation (11.19) implies
that if the leader and the follower have the same profit, _πF_ _πL,_ the follower player cares
only about maximizing his or her own profit as in the conventional model. However, if =
either _πL > πF_ or _πF > πL_ the follower loses some utility. Hence, the follower will be
willing to sacrifice some profit depending on how large _α_ and _β_ are. Usually, it is assumed
that _α > β,_ implying that the follower cares more about the leader being the one to earn
the greater profit.

Consider for example, the typical leader output of 10.19 found in the experiments. If
this output is taken as given, then the follower firm faces an inverse demand curve of:
_P_ = 19.81 − _q_ a and therefore a marginal revenue curve of MR = 19.81 − 2 _qF_ . Equating
this with its marginal cost of 6, the follower would maximize its profit at _qF_ 6.9 _,_ implying
that 12.91 is the price. However, this would mean that _πL_ _πF_ 70.41 =47.68 22.73 _,_
and this inequality in profits would reduce the followers utility if − = _α >_ 0. Note though that − =
the follower is in a position of doing something about this. If the follower increases output
a bit, this will lower the price and reduce the leader’s profit. It will also lower the follower’s
profit but not as much as the leader’s precisely because the follower’s output is increasing
while the leader’s output is, by assumption, given. Therefore, increasing its output will
reduce the profit difference between the two firms.

Because _β_ is not relevant when _πL > πF_ _,_ we can now write the follower’s utility
function as:


_U(πF_ _, πL)_ _(_ 1 _α)πF_ _απL_ (11.20)
= +      
It follows that the change in utility _�U_ satisfies:


_�U_ _(_ 1 _α)�πF_ _α�πL_ (11.21)
= +   

280 Strategic Interaction and Basic Oligopoly Models


At the optimal point, the follower is just balancing the greater profit equality its output
increase is bringing against the actual profit loss that increase causes. Hence, _�U_ = 0 at
the optimum implying that _α_ satisfies:



_α_ _[�π][F]_
1 _α_ _�πL_
+ [=]



_�πL_



(11.22)



It is straightforward to show that at the observed experimental average outputs in the
would lower its profit by about 28 percent as much as it would lower the leader’s output.Stackelberg experiments, _�πF /�πL_ = 0.277 _,_ i.e., an increase in the follower’s output
From this, we can infer that for this “representative” case, _α_ = 0.3845. In other words, the
follower players felt that having each firm have the same profit was about 40 percent as
important as having its own individual profit maximized. It is this rather sizable preference
for equal profit outcomes that Huck, M¨uller, and Normann (2001) deem responsible
for the more aggressive follower behavior they observe. Whether that preference also
characterizes real-world business people as opposed to experimental student players is an
open question. Even with that possible qualification, however, it is still notable how closely
the experimental outcomes follow the theoretical predictions for the relative Stackelberg
and Cournot outcomes.



**Summary**


Sequential market games are different from
simultaneous ones. Moreover, the effect of
changing from simultaneous to sequential play
differs depending on whether the strategic variable of choice is quantity or price. The basic
sequential quantity game, typically referred to as
the Stackelberg model, confers a large advantage
to the firm that chooses production first. In the
linear demand and cost case, the first mover in
a Stackelberg game produces the monopoly output. The follower produces only half this much.
Prices are lower than in the basic Cournot model,
but the large market share of the first mover gives
that firm an increase in profit over what it would
earn in the simultaneous production game.

In contrast, a sequential price game with differentiated products yields higher profits for both
firms than either would earn if prices were set
simultaneously. Moreover, in this case, it is the
firm that sets price last that does best if products are horizontally differentiated. Sequential
price games are thus an example of games that
have a second-mover as opposed to a first-mover
advantage.

How close theoretical models correspond to
economic reality is always a question. However,
experimental evidence relying on classroom “laboratory” test runs with students playing Cournot
and Stackelberg duopoly games suggests that
these players do respond largely in the manner



predicted by these models. This is true even
though the actual monetary reward earned by
these students averaged only about $9. If such
small motivations are enough to get student players to largely duplicate the theoretical predictions,
one might argue that actual business leaders
for whom the stakes of “getting it right” are
much higher might come that much closer to the
hypothesized ideal behavior.

Crucial to any sequential game is the issue of
commitment. How do firms establish themselves
as leaders or followers? How can a firm commit
to its output or price strategy in a way that a
rival finds credible? This issue is best explored
by considering the game in its extended form and
identifying strategy combinations that are subgame perfect, i.e., strategies that call for actions
at later points in the game in which those actions
continue to be optimal when the time comes to
take them, given the history of play up to that date.

Threats and promises of later punishments
and rewards are particularly important in games
in which one firm is trying to prevent another
from entering its market (or perhaps trying to
induce it to leave). The question again is whether
such threats and promises can be made credible.
If they can, then incumbent firms may be able to
maintain their dominant position in an industry
and not fear competitive entry. This is the subject
of our next chapter.

2. Let’s return to Tuftsville (Chapter 10) where
everyone lives along Main Street, which
is 10 miles long. There are 1,000 people
uniformly spread up and down Main Street,
and every day they each buy fruit smoothie
from one of the two stores located at either
end of the street. Customers ride their motor
scooters to and from the store, using $0.50
worth of gas per mile. Customers buy their
smoothies from the store offering the lowest
price, which is the store’s price plus the
customer’s travel expenses getting to and
from the store. Ben owns the store at the west
end of Main Street and Will owns the store
at the east end of Main Street. The marginal
cost of a smoothie is constant and equal to
$1 for both Ben and Will. In addition, each
of them pays Tuftsville $250 per day for the
right to sell smoothies.
a. Ben sets his price _p_ 1 first and then Will
sets his price _p_ 2. After the prices are

most two moves, the game ends. The game
begins with $1 sitting on a table. Player 1
can either take the $1 or wait. If player 1
takes the $1 the game is over, and player 1
gets to keep the $1. If player 1 waits, the $1

Southern Pelligrino, whose water is naturally carbonated but also somewhat “hard.”
The marketing department of each firm
has worked out the following profit matrix
depending on the price per 2-gallon container
charged by each firm. Southern Pellegrino’s
profits are shown as the first entry in each
pair.

a. What is the Nash equilibrium if the two
firms set prices simultaneously?
b. What is the Nash equilibrium if Northern Springs must set its price first and

## **Part Four**
# **Anticompetitive Behavior and** **Antitrust Policy**

The chapters in this section build on the game theoretic analysis of the previous three
chapters to explore the tactics that firms can employ to blunt competitive pressures and
thereby earn supracompetitive profits. In Chapter 12, we consider various tactics that exploit
the first-mover advantage of the incumbent relative to a new entrant, such as the excess
capacity investment stressed by Dixit (1980) and the bundling techniques discussed earlier
in Chapter 8. We also present some empirical evidence regarding the use of excess capacity
based on the Conlin and Kadiyali (2006) study of the Texas hotel industry.

In Chapter 13, we extend the analysis of so-called predatory behavior to include tactics
that exploit either the information advantage that the incumbent has, as in the classic
Milgrom and Roberts (1982) limit pricing paper, or the disadvantage that a small entrant
might have vis-`a-vis its creditors, as in the paper by Bolton and Scharfstein (1990). We
then examine the use of long-term contracts to “tie up” consumers and deny a new entrant
the customer base necessary to exploit scale economies. The empirical application for this
chapter is based on the Ellison and Ellison (2011) study of the advertising decisions of
pharmaceutical firms faced with potential new generic competitors as their key patents
expire.

Finally, in Chapter 14, we consider the ability of firms to collude and suppress competitive
pressures. Such price-fixing is a major concern of the antitrust laws. Indeed, the last fifteen
years have witnessed the successful prosecution of a record number of price-fixing cartels.
We begin with an analysis of the difficulties that must be overcome by cartel members if
collusion is to succeed. We then show how collusion can become an equilibrium outcome
in games of indefinite duration. This gives rise to the well-known Folk Theorem describing
the conditions under which those obstacles can be overcome. This permits a discussion
of antitrust policy including the recent practice of granting leniency to the first cartel
members who cooperate with the authorities, and how important this has been in breaking
international cartels. The chapter concludes with a discussion of Kwoka’s (1997) empirical
analysis of the impact of a real estate cartel that rigged auctions in the Washington, D.C.,
area.


### **12** **Entry Deterrence and Predation**

Elementary textbook presentations of microeconomics, such as our presentation in
Chapter 2, often represent monopoly power as a transient phenomenon. The argument
is that whenever a firm acquires market power and earns super-normal profit, entry will
occur and the new entrants will reestablish a competitive market. Those who follow actual
markets, however, know that this scenario may be more the exception than the rule.
Campbell’s, for example, has held a dominant position with 60 percent or more of the US
canned canned soup sales for over a hundred years. For twenty years, Microsoft’s _Windows_
has maintained a share of over 90 percent in the market for personal computer operating
systems, although this share drops to closer to 80 percent if tablet computers are included. [1]

Despite recent expansion by Chinese and other emerging economy firms, Sotheby’s and
Christie’s have together controlled roughly 55 percent of the world’s fine art auction market
for two decades, and as much as 70 percent of that market during many of those years. [2]

Such instances of sustained dominance are common. Moreover, such anecdotal evidence
is buttressed by formal analysis such as that by Baldwin (1995) and Geroski and Toker
(1996). These authors find that, on average, the number one firm in an industry retains that
rank for somewhere between seventeen and twenty-eight years. In short, there is abundant
evidence that, in contrast to the textbook analysis, market power is lasting. This raises the
question then as to how such firms can sustain their profit-winning position. Why don’t new
rivals emerge to compete away that market share and profit? Are there strategies that the
dominant firms can adopt to prevent this from happening? If so, what are these strategies
and what are their implications for market outcomes?

The questions just raised are the focus of this chapter. They are of much more than
mere academic interest. The potential for large incumbent firms to eliminate or prevent the
entry of rivals was a major motivation behind the enactment of antitrust laws in the first
place. That concern has persisted through many antitrust cases ever since, including the
dramatic Microsoft antitrust case in 2000. [3] Section 2 of the Sherman Act deems it illegal to
“monopolize or attempt to monopolize _. . ._ any part of the trade or commerce.” It follows

that enforcement of this provision requires an understanding of what a firm can do in order
to “monopolize” the market.

Employing tactics that are only profitable if they deter rival firms from competing in a
market is what economists call _predatory_ conduct. [4] A firm engaging in predatory conduct
wants to influence the behavior of its rivals—either those currently in the market or those
thinking of entering it. Predatory conduct often involves the making of threats and, if
necessary, actually implementing the threats in a way that ensures such threats are _credible_ .
Credibility is absolutely essential for predatory conduct to be successful. After all, as we
learned from the Chain Store Paradox in the last chapter, “talk is cheap.” A threat aimed
at dissuading a rival from entering one’s market will only have the desired effect if it is
credible. Such threats work when the rival or prey believes that the predator really “means
business” and will pursue the predatory conduct _if the rival chooses to ignore the threat_ .

In this chapter, we examine conduct designed either to deter rivals from entering an
incumbent’s market or to induce existing rivals to exit. Fear over such conduct was a
fundamental motivation behind the initial antitrust provisions, which focused on efforts “to
monopolize _. . ._ any part of the trade or commerce” and to “materially reduce competition.” [5]

The basis for this legislative concern is, of course, the fear that with existing rivals and
the threat of entry removed, a dominant firm will pursue monopoly practices that reduce
efficiency. In this chapter, we limit ourselves to cases of complete information. We defer
the examination of predatory conduct under incomplete information or uncertainty until the
next chapter.


12.1 MARKET STRUCTURE OVER TIME: RANDOM PROCESSES
& STYLIZED FACTS


Before we begin to model incumbent firm strategies to deter rivals’ entry and encourage
rivals’ exit, we need to consider more fully what theory and evidence can tell us about how
an industry’s structure might evolve over time. As a simple example, consider an industry
comprised of 256 firms, each with sales of $10 million. Suppose that in any period, sales at
each firm will decline by 30 percent with probability 0.25, stay the same with probability
0.5, or return to their prior level with probability 0.25 for any firm of any size. (If these
rates of growth or decline seem large, think of a period as say three or four years long.)
Table 12.1 shows the evolution of firm size over just four periods. We can see that even
over this short amount of time, the distribution of firm sizes is becoming very unequal. The
largest firm is now nine times as large as the smallest and the top nine firms account for
roughly the same amount of output as the bottom forty. This inequality will grow even
larger as we let the process run over more periods of time.

The trend toward increasing inequality is a common feature of any process in which
growth in any period is a random variable independent of firm size and previous growth
rates. It is broadly referred to as Gibrat’s Law after Robert Gibrat (1931) who made the
following formal argument. Let _Xt_ be a firm’s size at time _t_ . Let this be related to its size
at _t_ - 1 by the following stochastic process:

_Xt_ = _(_ 1 + _vt_ _)Xt_ −1 (12.1)

4 See, for example, Fisher (1991).
5 Our definition is also similar to that of Ordover and Willig (1981).

Here _vt_ is a random disturbance term that we assume is normally distributed and has mean
_µ_ and variance _σ_ [2] . Next, take the natural log of both sides. If the time interval between
_t_ and _t_ 1 is short, we may use the approximation that ln _(_ 1 _vt_ _)_ _vt_ _,_ where we uses
   - + ≈
lower case letters to denote logs. Hence, we may now write:


_xt_ = _xt_ −1 + _vt_ (12.2)

Denoting _x_ at time _t_ 0 as _x_ 0, repeated substitution yields:
=

_xt_ = _vt_ + _vt_ −1 + _vt_ −2 + _v_ t−3 + _. . ._ + _x_ 0 (12.3)

This last equation says that the logarithm of the firm’s size at time _t_ will just be a random
variable reflecting the accumulation of all the random growth shocks it has experienced up
to that time. Each shock is itself a random variable drawn from the normal distribution.
Thus over _k_ time periods, as the importance of _x_ 0 approaches zero, _xt_ will converge to a
random variable with mean _kµ_ and variance _kσ_ [2] . In turn, this implies that the variance of
firm size itself will be _e_ _[k(]_ [2] _[µ]_ [+] _[σ]_ [ 2] _[)]_ _(e_ _[kσ]_ [ 2] - 1 _)_, which of course is far larger than _kσ_ [2] . Indeed,
over a long time period the sum of all those accumulated shocks is also a normal random
variable. Recall however that logarithms reflect exponential power. As the log of a firm’s
assets doubles, the actual volume of those assets is squared. So, although the log of firm
size may be normally distributed, the distribution of actual firm sizes will be skewed. Those
firms with above average values for the log of firm size will have many times above average
values when size is measured without logs.

As mentioned previously, the outcome described above in which a market concentration
increases endogenously over time is usually referred to as Gibrat’s Law after its originator
Robert Gibrat (1931). It has generated enormous interest in part because it suggests
that oligopoly or even monopoly are natural market outcomes. In a rough way, it is
consistent with the evidence cited earlier that dominant firms retain their market power for
a considerable length of time. In fact, in an early study motivated by Gibrat’s work, Kalecki
(1945) produced some evidence that was very supportive of this natural concentrating
tendency.

To a large extent, however, the subsequent research on Gibrat’s Law focuses primarily
on what that analysis leaves out rather than what it keeps in. This is because the Gibrat
process is very mechanistic. There is no talk of research and cost-saving innovations that
enhance a firm’s growth. There is no consideration of mergers and firm combinations over
time. Perhaps most relevant for our present purpose, there is no discussion of new firms


Entry Deterrence and Predation 287


entering an industry or older firms leaving, or what strategic interaction may lie behind such
entry and exit. Subsequent research has tried to remedy these omissions and to develop
theoretical models of industry evolution that build in these features [See, for example,
Jovanovic (1982), Nelson and Winter (1982), Sutton (1997), and Klepper (2002).]

Of course, any theoretical model must ultimately confront the real world facts. Over the
last twenty-five years, economists have worked hard to review the data and to document
any empirical regularities or stylized facts that appear. A survey of these studies suggests
that there are four stylized facts that any theory of industrial evolution must explain.

The first is that _entry is common_ . Dunne et al. (1988, 1989), using US census data between
1963 and 1982, computed rates of entry in a wide cross section of two-digit SIC manufacturing industries. Their estimate of the average entry rate in manufacturing—defined as the
number of _new_ firms over a five-year period relative to the number of incumbent firms at the
start of that period—ranged between 41.4 percent and 51.8 percent (about 8 to 10 percent on
an annual basis). For the United Kingdom, Geroski (1995) estimated somewhat smaller but
still significant annual rates of entry for a sample of 87 three-digit manufacturing industries.
These ranged between 2.5 percent and 14.5 percent over the period 1974 to 1979. Cable and
Schwalbach (1991) show that similar rates of entry exist across a wide range of developed
countries. More recently, Jarmin et al. (2004) showed that rates of entry are even higher in
the retail sector and may reach well over 60 percent, especially during periods of economic
prosperity. [6]

The second stylized fact is that when entry occurs it is, by and large, _small-scale entry_ .
The studies by Dunne et al. (1988, 1989) showed that the collective market share of entrants
in an industry ranged between 13.9 and 18.8 percent, again over a five-year interval. [7]

Similarly, in Geroski’s (1995) UK study, the market share of a new entrant was found to be
quite modest, ranging from 1.45 to 6.35 percent. In the United States, Cable and Schwalbach
(1991) find that while new entrants typically constitute 7.7 percent of an industry’s firms in
any year, they account for only 3.2 percent of its output. The typical share of entrants in
retailing is noticeably larger, say closer to 25 percent, according to Jarmin et al. (2004), but
they also find that this value has been declining over recent years.

The third stylized fact is that the _new entrant survival rate is relatively low_ . Dunne et al.
(1988, 1989) find that roughly 61.5 percent of all entrant firms exited within five years
of entry and 79.6 percent exited within ten years. The corresponding exit rates found in
retailing by Jarmin et al. (2004) are a very similar, between 59 percent and 82 percent.
Birch (1987) used Dun and Bradstreet data for all sectors in the United States including,
but not limited to, manufacturing and found that about 50 percent of all new entrant firms
fail within the first five years.

Our final stylized fact that appears to hold in every study is that while rates of entry and
exit vary across industries, _industries with high entry rates also have high exit rates_ . In other
words, entry and exit rates are strongly correlated. To take just one clear example, Cable
and Schwalbach (1991) found that corresponding to an entry rate of 7.7 percent accounting
for 3.2 percent of industry output, the exit rate is 7.0 percent and similarly it accounts for
3.3 percent of industry output. This finding is a little surprising because it does not appear
consistent with the hypothesis that entry occurs in response to above-normal profit or that


6 The Dunne et al. (1988, 1989) entry (and exit) estimates are generally higher than those obtained by other
researchers owing to the fact that they explicitly recognize the multiproduct and multiplant nature of firms.
7 Dunne et al. (1988) did find that existing firms who enter a new market through diversification typically
enter at a larger scale than new, or _de novo_, entrants do.


288 Anticompetitive Behavior and Antitrust Policy


exit reflects a below-normal profit. If profit is high, and therefore entry attractive, there is
no reason for firms to leave. Similarly, if profit is so low that firms are induced to leave the
industry, there ought to be little incentive for new entrants to emerge.

Taken together, the stylized facts reported above can be read as suggesting a sort of
revolving-door setting in which mostly small firms enter, eventually fail, and exit, only to
be replaced by a new cohort of small-scale entrants. In this view, the major difference across
industries would be the pace at which this entry-fail-exit cycle proceeds. One interpretation
of this evidence is that it reflects repeated attempts and, just as often, repeated failures of
small firms to penetrate the markets dominated by large incumbents. This may help explain
the correlation between entry and exit rates. Incumbents in markets that seem the most
tempting targets may be those firms that fight the hardest against new entrants.

More formal support for this revolving door interpretation is offered by Urban et al.
(1984) on the benefits of incumbency. They studied 129 frequently purchased brands of
consumer products in twelve US markets and found that market shares were a decreasing
function of the order of entry of the brand. Earlier entrants enjoyed larger market shares,
all else equal. Similar results have been found by Lambkin (1988), Mitchell (1991), and
Brown and Lattin (1994). [8]

A more recent analysis that combines an underlying theoretical random process with
actual market data is Sutton’s (2007) examination of forty-five Japanese industries over a
twenty-three year period. Given the initial distribution of market shares and the variance of
shocks to those shares, Sutton (2007) can calculate the expected number of initial industry
leaders that will have lost their position due to random shocks after say fifteen or twenty
years. In both cases, he finds that the actual number of such leadership losses is significantly
less than what one would expect, i.e., market leaders retain their position significantly
more than one would anticipate given the normal randomness those shares exhibit. Thus,
this finding also suggests that leading firms retain their dominance longer than one would
normally expect.

To be sure, the persistence of market dominance may well reflect the superior cost
efficiency or higher product quality of those firms that emerge as market leaders early on.
However, it is frequently alleged (especially by failed rival entrants) that the ability of early
entrants to sustain a dominant industry position also reflects deliberate behavior aimed
either at driving new entrants out or preventing their entry in the first place. This is the
primary issue addressed in this and the subsequent chapter.


12.2 PREDATORY CONDUCT AND LIMIT PRICING


As noted above, there is a difference between a rational competitive response to rival entry
and truly predatory behavior. We know, for example, that both the static Cournot and
Bertrand models predict that when a second firm enters a previously monopolized market,
the initial incumbent’s response will lead to a (possibly dramatic) fall in price. While
this may make the entry less profitable, it does not reflect anything other than a normal
competitive response to competitive pressure. For true predation to occur, economists


8 As Caves (1998) notes, though, there is regression toward the mean in firm growth rates. That is, really large
firms tend to grow more slowly than do small ones. This feature blunts the ever-increasing concentration
tendency implied by Gibrat’s Law.
