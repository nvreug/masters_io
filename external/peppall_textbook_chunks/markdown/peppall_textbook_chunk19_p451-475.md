Equation (16.13) confirms that, under our foreclosure assumption, the downstream division
of the integrated firm has a greater output than its non-integrated rival.

The downstream division of the integrated firm is noticeably larger and more profitable
than its independent downstream rival. This is the result of the foreclosure of supply to _D_ 2,
which gave _U_ 2 monopoly power that _U_ 2 thereafter exploited by setting a high upstream
price. Again, using our specific numbers, the upstream price to _D_ 2 is $36.5. Because the
integrated retailer buys its input at cost, it sells 22.5 units downstream while its independent
rival sells just 9 units. The resulting retail price is $68.5. Prior to the merger, _D_ 2 earned
a profit of $144. That has now been reduced to $81. The merging firms, however, have
benefited. Their combined profit before the merger was $360. It has risen through integration
to $506.25.

Two points need to be considered. First, does our assumption of foreclosure make
sense? Is it profit-maximizing for the integrated firm not to sell any inputs to its independent
downstream rival? This is where Salinger’s (1988) argument comes into play. The integrated
firm has a total input cost of _c_ _[U]_ + _c_ _[D]_ . It therefore earns _P_ _[D]_ - _(c_ _[U]_ + _c_ _[D]_ _)_ on each unit that
it sells downstream. Further, we know that for the rival _D_ 2 to be in business, it must be
the case that _P_ _[D]_ _> (P_ _[U]_ + _c_ _[D]_ _)_ . Suppose that the integrated firm did sell one unit of its
intermediate good to its independent rival _D_ 2 at price _P_ _[U]_ . What would happen if instead it
withdrew this unit and sold it internally to the downstream division so that the total output
and therefore the price in the downstream market remain unchanged? In withdrawing the
unit originally sold to _D_ 2, the integrated firm loses profit _P_ _[U]_ - _c_ _[U]_ . However, it then gains
a profit _P_ _[D]_ - _(c_ _[U]_ + _c_ _[D]_ _)_ that it makes on every internal sale. It will therefore be profitable
to stop selling to the downstream rival or to foreclose if _P_ _[D]_ - _(c_ _[U]_ + _c_ _[D]_ _) > P_ _[U]_ - _c_ _[U]_ .
This condition simplifies to _P_ _[D]_ _> (P_ _[U]_ + _c_ _[D]_ _)_, which we know has to hold given that the
downstream rival is in business. In other words, if the integrated firm were selling to _D_ 2
then it could always do better by withdrawing those units and instead sell them internally
to increase its own downstream production. In our numerical example, the integrated firm
ultimately earns $68.5 − $23 − $23 = $22.5 for every upstream unit sold internally. By
contrast, it would earn only $36.5 − $23 = $13.5 on upstream sales to _D_ 2. Therefore,
foreclosure of sales to downstream rivals does seem to be optimal.

The second feature worth noting is that the vertical merger brings benefits to consumers
despite the foreclosure that also accompanies it. In our numerical example, the vertical
integration of firms _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 causes the price in the downstream market to fall from
$76 to $68.5. The elimination of double marginalization by the integrating firms benefits
consumers. Salinger (1988) shows, however, that this need not be the case. The competitive
effect of a vertical merger is determined by the balance between two forces. On the one
hand, vertical merger and market foreclosure reduce the number of independent upstream
suppliers and so reduce the competitive pressure on upstream—and downstream—prices.
On the other hand, a vertical merger eliminates double marginalization for the merged
firms and, by reducing their input costs, makes them fiercer competitors in the downstream
market, tending to reduce consumer prices. It is difficult to predict how this will play out.


Vertical and Conglomerate Mergers 441


What is likely to be the case is that the anticompetitive effect will be weak if the number of
independent upstream competitors remains large.

Moreover, there is an important strategic issue that is not addressed by the Salinger
(1988) model. The independent downstream firms that are foreclosed upon may well have
an incentive to react to integrated rivals by merging with upstream firms themselves. If
vertical integration brings business advantages, then all firms should have an incentive to
pursue them. Policy should not penalize any one firm because it happens to be first in line in
this process. To address this point, as well as to explore other features of vertical mergers,
we now consider the model of Ordover, Saloner, and Salop (1990) (OSS).


16.3.2 Vertical Mergers in a Differentiated Products Setting


The OSS model is in some ways simpler and in others more complex than the Salinger
model. It is simpler in that we assume Bertrand competition with homogenous upstream
products implying marginal cost pricing. It is more complex in that we treat the relationships
between upstream and downstream firms more strategically.

The upstream firms incur constant marginal cost _c_ _[U]_ . One unit of the upstream product
is needed for every unit of downstream production; the downstream firms have no other
production costs. In contrast to the Salinger model, firms sell differentiated products and
compete in prices in both markets. The upstream product of the two firms is homogeneous
but the downstream products are differentiated. We capture this feature by letting the
demand for downstream products 1 and 2 be respectively:



_q_ 1 _[D]_

_q_ _[D]_



1 _[D]_ 1

[=] _[ A]_ [ −] _[p][D]_

2 _[D]_ 2

[=] _[ A]_ [ −] _[p][D]_

2 _[D]_ 1

1 _[D]_ 2

[−] _[p][D]_



1 _[)]_

2 _[D][)]_



_(_ 0 _< B <_ ∞ _)_ (16.22)



In equation (16.22), _B_ is an inverse measure of the degree of product differentiation in
the downstream market. If _B_ = 0, the two products are totally differentiated. However, as
_B_ approaches infinity the two products become increasingly similar. To keep the analysis
as simple as we can, we normalize _A_ = 100 and _c_ _[U]_ = 0 without loss of generality, and we
assume that _B_ = 1. [4]

In order to consider the explicitly strategic aspects of vertical mergers, OSS develop a
four-stage game. In the first stage, one of the downstream firms can choose to acquire one of
the upstream suppliers. If such a merger takes place we assume, without loss of generality,
that it is between _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 and results in the merged firm _F_ 1.

In the second stage, input prices are set. If no merger occurs then the upstream firms
compete in prices. If a merger has occurred then in the second stage two possibilities are
considered. First, _F_ 1 refuses to supply _D_ 2, i.e., foreclosure. Second, _F_ 1 sets an upper
bound on the input price to be paid by _D_ 2 by offering to supply it at price _c_ 12, with _F_ 1
setting _c_ 12 before _U_ 2 sets its input price. This allows _U_ 2 to undercut _F_ 1 in this stage by
setting its price “just less” than _c_ 12. In the third stage, if there has been a merger in the
first stage firms _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 decide whether or not to merge. We then proceed to the fourth
stage. Here, downstream prices are set given the input prices and organizational structures
that have been determined in the previous stages. As usual, we solve this game by working
backwards from stage 4.


4 The choice of _B_ does affect profits but does not actually affect the equilibrium that emerges from the
model.


442 Contractual Relations Between Firms


To specify the extensive form of this four-stage game, we need to identify the pay-offs
under the different strategy combinations that can occur.

We begin with the most general case in which firm _D_ 1 pays _c_ 1 and firm _D_ 2 pays _c_ 2,
respectively, for the upstream product. Our demand equations then imply marginal revenue
for each downstream firm given by:



_MR_ 1 = 50 + _[p]_ 2 [2]

_MR_ 2 = 50 + _[p]_ 2 [1]



2

[−] _[q]_ [1]

Equating each firm’s marginal revenue with its upstream marginal cost yields the best
response functions:

Solving these for _p_ _[D]_

2 _[D]_ [gives the downstream prices:]

_p_ _[D]_



(16.25)
15 _[(]_ [250][ +][ 4] _[c]_ [1][ +] _[ c]_ [2] _[)]_



As we might expect, both prices are increasing in the costs of the upstream inputs.
Substituting these prices into the downstream demand functions of equations (16.22) gives
the equilibrium downstream outputs of:



1 _[D][(c]_ 1 _[, c]_ 2 _[)]_ [ =] [2]

2 _[D][(c]_ 1 _[, c]_ 2 _[)]_ [ =] [2]

(16.26)

Each firm’s downstream output is decreasing in its own costs but increasing in the rival’s
costs.

If we now solve for each downstream firm’s profits, it is straightforward to show that
these are:



2
1 _[D][(c]_ 1 _[, c]_ 2 _[)]_ [ =]
225 _[(]_ [500][ −] [7] _[c]_ [1][ +][ 2] _[c]_ [2] _[)]_ [2]

225 _[(]_ [500][ −] [7] _[c]_ [2][ +][ 2] _[c]_ [1] _[)]_ [2]



_π_ _[D]_



An important point to note for subsequent analysis is that the profit of downstream firm _i_ is
decreasing in its own input cost _ci_ and increasing in its rival’s input cost _cj_ .

Now consider the third stage. If there is no merger in stage 1, there is no merger in stage
3 and the independent upstream firms, acting as Bertrand competitors, supply the upstream


Vertical and Conglomerate Mergers 443


product at marginal cost _c_ _[U]_ = 0. In this case, the upstream firms just break even, while
equation (16.27) with _c_ 1 _c_ 2 0, implies aprofit for each downstream firm of:
= =



_π_ _[D]_



1 _[D][(]_ [0,0] _[)]_ [ =] _[ π]_ 2 _[D]_



2 _[D][(]_ [0,0] _[)]_ [ =][ 2,222.22] (16.28)



Suppose by contrast that there has been a merger of _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 in stage 1 to form firm
_F_ 1. As we noted above, we then consider two possibilities in stage 2 of the game. The first
of these is that _F_ 1 forecloses on _D_ 2. The second is that _F_ 1 sets its input price _c_ 12 before
_U_ 2 sets its input price.

Suppose that _F_ 1 forecloses in stage 2. If in stage 3 firms _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 do not merge, this
effectively makes _U_ 2 a monopoly supplier to _D_ 2 (in much the same way as we saw in the
Salinger model). Because one unit of the upstream product is required to make one unit of the
final product, profit of _U_ 2 if it sets input price _cm_ is _π_ 2 _[U]_ _[(c][U]_ _[, c]_ _m_ _[)]_ _[ (c]_ _m_ _[c][U]_ _[)q]_ 2 _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c]_ _m_ _[)]_ [,]

Inverting U2’s demand curve to solve for its marginal revenue and then setting this to its
assumed marginal cost of 0 yields the optimal upstream price _cm_ :


_cm_ 250 _/_ 7 $35.71 (16.30)
= =

Substituting this price into (16.27) and (16.29) gives the profit for _U_ 2 of 25,000 _/_ 21 and
for _D_ 2 of 5000 _/_ 9. In other words, aggregate profit of _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 if they do not merge in
response to merger and foreclosure by _F_ 1 is


_π_ 2 _[A][(]_ [0] _[, c]_ _m_ _[)]_ [ =][ 110,000] _[/]_ [63][ =][ $1,746.03] (16.31)


Profit to _F_ 1 from this foreclosure strategy is:


_π_ 1 _[D][(]_ [0] _[, c]_ _m_ _[)]_ [ =][ 1,280,000] _[/]_ [441][ =][ $2,902.49] (16.32)


Now consider what happens if instead _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 merge to form firm _F_ 2. Both _F_ 1 and
_F_ 2 then obtain the upstream product at marginal cost. As a result, the profits of _F_ 1 and _F_ 2
are each given by equation (16.28), that is, $2,222.22. Comparison with (16.31) and (16.32)
indicates that if _F_ 1 forecloses on _D_ 2 then _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 will merge, significantly reducing
the profit of _F_ 1.

As we suggested near the end of our discussion of the Salinger model, those who belong
to the club of vertically integrated firms may wish to exclude others from joining. Facing
vertically integrated rivals means competing against firms with low input costs and this can
lead to intense price competition. So, suppose that _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 have merged to form _F_ 1 but
want to prevent _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 from doing the same thing. Is there a strategy that might work
to achieve this goal? OSS suggest that there is, indeed, such a strategy.

Suppose that in stage 2, _F_ 1 does not foreclose but instead offers to supply _D_ 2 at unit input
price _c_ 12 _> c_ _[U]_ . As we noted above, we assume that _F_ 1 sets _c_ 12 before _U_ 2 sets its input
price, so clearly _U_ 2 can win _D_ 2’s business by just undercutting _c_ 12 and has an incentive
to do so because _c_ 12 _> c_ _[U]_ . However, by committing to price _c_ 12, _F_ 1 puts a ceiling on the


444 Contractual Relations Between Firms


price that _U_ 2 can charge _D_ 2 and thereby limits the gains from a merger of _U_ 2 and _D_ 2. To
see this more clearly consider the following analysis.

Profit to _D_ 2 given that _F_ 1 supplies its own downstream division at marginal cost _c_ _[U]_ = 0
and thatand _c_ 2 _U c_ 122 just undercuts: _c_ 12 in supplying _D_ 2 is given by equation (16.27) with _c_ 1 = 0

It follows from these results that there is always an input price _c_ 12 _< c_ [∗] that _F_ 1 can set
to make _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 jointly more profitable as separate firms than they would be if they
merged: in our example _c_ [∗] = $8.83. In preventing their merger, _F_ 1 not only preserves itself
as the lone vertically integrated firm but also ensures that it continues to face a high-cost
rival in the downstream market rather than the low cost one it would face if _U_ 2 and _D_ 2
merged. In other words, _F_ 1 has an incentive to set _c_ 12 as high as possible while preventing

The OSS analysis just outlined is illustrated in Figure 16.5 where we show the extensive
form of the four-stage game.

Suppose that _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 merge in stage 1 to form _F_ 1. If _F_ 1 chooses to Foreclose in
stage 2 then _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 will choose to merge in stage 3 as a result of which _F_ 1 has profit

By construction of _c_ [∗] we know that _π_ 2 _[A][(c][U]_ _[, c]_ [∗] _[ε) > π]_ 2 _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c][U]_ _[)]_ [ so] _[ U]_ [2 and] _[ D]_ [2 choose]

By construction of _c_ [∗] we know that _π_ 2 _[A][(c][U]_ _[, c]_ [∗] [−] _[ε) > π]_ 2 _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c][U]_ _[)]_ [ so] _[ U]_ [2 and] _[ D]_ [2 choose]

not to merge. As a result, _F_ 1 has profit $2,383.79. It follows that _F_ 1 prefers to set price
_c_ 12 _c_ [∗] than to Foreclose. So if _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 Merge in stage 1 the merged firm will offer to
supply = _D_ 2 at price _c_ [∗] in stage 2, as a result of which _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 choose not to merge in
stage 3 and _F_ 1 earns _π_ _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c]_ [∗] _[)]_ [ $2,383.79] _[.]_



stage 3 and _F_ 1 earns _π_ 1 _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c]_ [∗] _[)]_ [ =][ $2,383.79] _[.]_

Now suppose that _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 choose not to merge in stage 1. Then the upstream
firms compete in prices and set input price at marginal cost _c_ _[U]_, as a result of which the
downstream firms, in competing in prices, earn _π_ _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c][U]_ _[)]_ _[ π]_ _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c][U]_ _[)]_ [ 2,222.22.]



downstream firms, in competing in prices, earn _π_ 1 _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c][U]_ _[)]_ [ =] _[ π]_ 2 _[D][(c][U]_ _[, c][U]_ _[)]_ [ =][ 2,222.22.]

Clearly, _U_ 1 and _D_ 1 prefer to merge.

To summarize, the subgame perfect equilibrium to the OSS four-stage game is that firms
_U_ 1 and _D_ 1 merge in stage 1 to form _F_ 1. Then _F_ 1 offers to supply _D_ 2 in stage 2 at input
price _c_ [∗], as a result of which _U_ 2 and _D_ 2 do not merge in stage 3.

Note among other things that the strategy of offering to supply its rival at price _c_ 12 _> c_ _[U]_



is much closer in spirit to the “squeeze” pricing that phone companies and Alcoa have
been accused of than is outright foreclosure. Note too that by preventing the merger of
_U_ 2 and _D_ 2, and thereby preserving the existence of double marginalization and a high
cost rival, _F_ 1’s strategy of offering to sell to _D_ 2 at price _c_ 12 leads to higher prices for
consumers. It is an action designed to thwart the outbreak of competition and is therefore
truly anti-competitive. In all these ways, the OSS model has an air of realism about it.

Chen (2001) extends the OSS analysis, starting from the empirical regularity that
foreclosure seems to be a rarity in practice. He shows that whenever the wholesale price


446 Contractual Relations Between Firms


offered by the integrated firm and independent producer _U_ 2 is the same, the independent
downstream firm _D_ 2 will prefer to buy from the integrated producer. Why? Because in
so doing, _D_ 2 gives the integrated firm another source of profit—a source that rises as _D_ 2
sells more downstream. As a result of selling to _D_ 2, the integrated firm will price less
aggressively in the downstream market because this would cut into its profit on input sales
to _D_ 2. Of course, less aggressive downstream pricing also helps _D_ 2 and that is precisely
why _D_ 2 would prefer to buy from the integrated firm rather than from _U_ 2. Indeed, Chen
(2001) suggests that if there are cost efficiencies associated with the vertical merger so
that _c_ _[U]_ falls at the integrated firm, the merger could lead to a different sort of foreclosure
altogether. Instead of cutting off independent downstream firms from a source of supply,
the vertical merger may leave independent upstream firms without any customers. [5]


16.4 REAPPRAISAL AND APPLICATION: THE GE-HONEYWELL
MERGER


Let us return to the GE-Honeywell merger described at the start of this chapter. As noted, the
European Commission eventually ruled against the merger. Their reasoning is summarized
in the following extract from the Commission’s report (paragraph 355):


Because of their lack of ability to match the bundle offer . . . [independent] suppliers will lose
market shares to the benefit of the merged entity and experience an immediate damaging profit
shrinkage. As a result, the merger is likely to lead to market foreclosure on the existing aircraft
platforms and subsequently to the elimination of competition in these areas. [6]


There are several points to make in regard to this judgment. First, the “bundling” and
unfair competitive advantage that the commission feared would give GE-Honeywell a
competitive advantage is nothing more than the elimination of the double marginalization
that we have described above. Eliminating double marginalization gave a similar advantage
to the integrated firms in the oligopoly models that we have studied in this chapter.
Packaging jet engines with engine starter motors is economically equivalent to combining
the upstream manufacturing with the retail services of a downstream dealer. Thus, there is
some legitimacy in the Commission’s fear that GE-Honeywell would gain some advantage
over independent rivals.

Whether the merger would lead to foreclosure and whether, if it did, this would raise
prices is another matter. In part, that would depend on the nature of initial competition.
If the market were very competitive with lots of jet engine firms and avionics companies,
then the merger could have very little anticompetitive impact. The nature of competition in
both the upstream and the downstream affects the likelihood of foreclosure and its ultimate
impact. In short, some understanding of the real world market place is necessary to make
an informed judgment regarding this merger.


5 Pepall and Norman (2001) offer a similar analysis to Chen (2001) in which vertical foreclosure is never
an equilibrium precisely because, again, this leads to competition between multiple vertically integrated
firms.
6 The full decision is available at: _http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/_
_m2220_en.pdf_ .


Vertical and Conglomerate Mergers 447


It is fair to say that neither pre-merger market was competitively structured. Estimates
of GE’s share of the jet engine market for large commercial aircraft range from 28 to 52
percent, and it had just two major rivals, namely, the Pratt-Whitney division of United
Technologies and the Rolls Royce Group. Likewise, Honeywell’s share of the avionics
market was on the order of 50 percent, and it had just three rivals: Rockwell Collins (25
percent), Thales (15 percent), and Smiths Industries (5 percent). In reaching its decision,
the European Commission appears to have been persuaded that the preeminence of GE and
Honeywell made subsequent integration by their rivals impossible. As a result, and as the
quote above makes clear, the Commission feared foreclosure of GE’s competitors and the
ultimate loss of competition in the jet engine market.

The Commission is implicitly claiming that rivals could not integrate as well and this
would need to be documented. More importantly, we should in this case show that even with
foreclosure, the resulting market outcome is worse than the pre-merger case. This was _not_ the
case in our numerical example of the Salinger (1988) model. In that example, integration by
one firm did lead to foreclosure of its rival. Nevertheless, the post-merger downstream price
of $68.5 was still well below the pre-merger price of $76. As a review of that example will
quickly reveal, even if the foreclosure eventually led the integrated firm to enjoy a complete
downstream monopoly, the retail price would still decline to $73. This is, of course, a stylized
example. Nevertheless, it reveals just how large the inefficiencies of double-marginalization
could be, and perhaps why many economists thought the ruling a mistake. [7]


16.5 CONGLOMERATE MERGERS


The final type of merger to consider is a conglomerate merger. Such mergers bring under
common control firms whose products are neither direct substitutes nor complements. The
outcome is to join a set of firms producing a diversified range of products with little or
nothing in common. While conglomerate companies have been with us for some time, the
US merger wave starting in the 1960s and continuing into the early 1980s is, particularly
in the earlier years, when many of the conglomerates that we see today were formed. The
question is whether we can develop a convincing economic rationale for these mergers. If
not, then we should think of conglomerates as an accident of history that are being gradually
corrected through corporate downsizing and the focus on “core businesses,” strategies that
appear to characterize corporate change in the new millennium. A number of reasons have,
however, been advanced to support the emergence of conglomerate firms. We examine
these in turn.


16.5.1 Possible Economies Associated with Conglomeration


Scope economies and saving on transactions costs are two possible advantages that may
accrue to conglomerate firms. By scope economies we mean that a variety of products or
services are more cheaply produced by one firm than by two or more firms. By transaction


7 Nalebuff (2004) offers a similar analysis of the GE-Honeywell case set in a framework of differentiated
products. To be fair, the Commission noted other fears besides foreclosure. One was that GE also had an
unfair advantage in that its large financial operations allowed it to package financing with jet aircraft in a
way that Pratt-Whitney and Rolls Royce could not. There was also a horizontal element to the case as GE
and Honeywell were the only two suppliers of regional jet engines.

costs we mean the costs that are incurred by firms when they use external markets in order
to exchange goods and services. [8] These include, for example, the costs of searching for the
desired inputs, negotiating supply contracts, monitoring and enforcing these contracts, and
the risk associated with unforeseen changes in supply conditions.

Scope economies derive primarily from the ability of the firm to exploit common inputs
in the manufacture of a range of products. The same production line can be used for
several products, marketing efforts can promote the whole range of goods a firm produces,
and the fruits of research and development may extend to a number of diverse products.
Advertising and promotional activities also frequently exhibit scope economies across a
variety of activities. This line of argument implies that for scope economies to be an
important element in conglomerate mergers it is necessary that the firms that merge are
related in some respect. Either they sell in similar markets or they have similar production
technologies. The data on conglomerates do not appear to be consistent with this hypothesis.
A detailed study by Nathanson and Cassano (1982) concludes that there are at least as many
conglomerate firms that produce goods with little in common, whether this be technology
or the markets at which they are targeted, as there are firms that have relatively low product
and market diversity.


8 For an excellent discussion of transaction costs, see Besanko, Dranove, and Shanley (2009).


Vertical and Conglomerate Mergers 449


Transactions costs are particularly significant when specialized or knowledge-intensive
assets are traded. Consider a specialized asset, such as a sophisticated machine that is
specifically designed to produce two goods, A and B. Let us also suppose that the markets
for A and B are highly concentrated with a small number of producers, and that the owner
of the machine has spare capacity if the machine is used only to produce A. This might
arise, for example, if demand for A is limited relative to the productive capacity of the
machine. If such spare capacity exists, the owner of the machine may wish to use it to
produce B goods as well. A conglomerate merger or the machine owner merging together
A and B production is one way that this can happen. However, as Teece (1982) and others
have argued, conglomeration is not strictly necessary. The machine owner, a producer of
A, can instead simply lease the spare capacity to B producers.

There is a potential problem with the leasing arrangement, however. Because the number
of B producers is small, each will have some monopoly power in bargaining over the terms
of the lease. As a result, the machine owner may find that the costs and risks associated
with the negotiations between the interested parties are large as each side tries to get the
best possible deal. Conglomeration may be a means of avoiding such costs. By using the
machine to produce both A and B within the same firm, the machine owner avoids all the
bargaining hassles. There is no longer any conflict over how to divide the gains from using
the machine because those gains all go to the same owner.

Transaction costproblems are particularly importantwhen the assetinvolved is knowledge
or information intensive. The knowledge of such matters as organizational routines or
specialized customer needs is generally embodied in specific individuals or teams employed
by the company. It is difficult to envision contracts to “lease” such personnel.

In short, the effort to minimize the transactions costs associated with contracting between
firms may explain conglomerate mergers to some extent. Nevertheless this motivation
seems unlikely to be the major factor behind such mergers. The reason is that here again,
we are talking about some asset that is common to all the lines of production operated by
the conglomerate, and such commonality in productive assets does not seem to be a feature
of conglomerate firms.


16.5.2 Managerial Motives


The skepticism surrounding the explanations based on scope economies, transaction cost
savings, and other arguments why conglomerate mergers improve production efficiency
has led some to postulate a different, less benign motivation. The alternative motiveis that
it is in the interest of management even if it is not in the interest of shareholders. Because
management calls the shots, it is the managerial interest that prevails.

In any reasonably large public company, ownership, which essentially resides with the
shareholders, may be separated from control, which essentially resides with the management
team. This separation would not matter too much if management performance could be
perfectly observed and monitored by shareholders. Yet perfect monitoring is rare, and
absent such monitoring, management can pursue its own agenda at least to some extent.
This would not matter so long as the best interests of management are served by maximizing
shareholder wealth. It is precisely the attempt to secure this harmony of interest that lies
behind the use of performance-related clauses and payment in stock options in many
executive compensation schemes. Still, the match between the interests of shareholders
and management is rarely perfect, leaving management with at least some ability to pursue
goals other than maximization of shareholders’ returns.


450 Contractual Relations Between Firms


Suppose that management compensation is based upon company growth. [9] Growth is far
from easy to generate internally. It requires that market share be won from competitors who
can hardly be expected to sit passively by when they lose customers. Nor is it easy to buy
growth through horizontal mergers because this is the kind of acquisition that is watched
by the antitrust authorities. In these circumstances, we should not be surprised to find
management supporting a conglomerate merger, even if this is not necessarily in the best
long-term interests of shareholders. Such a merger offers management the desired growth
while avoiding antitrust problems. In this light, it is, perhaps, significant that the greatest
wave of conglomerate mergers in the United States coincided with a period in which the
antitrust authorities were particularly fierce in their examination of mergers between related
companies.

Management may also pursue conglomeration as a means to minimize risk. When a
firm is involved in many distinct markets it avoids putting all its eggs in one basket. Such
diversification may be important to management. [10] Shareholders often use compensation
schemes that closely tie management’s pay to the firm’s profit performance. [11] Yet while
these practices work to align management’s interests more closely to those of the stockholders, they also increase the risk that management faces. As profits go up and down,
management’s compensation rises and falls irrespective of whether the profit results were
management’s fault or not. To protect against such fluctuations, management may seek to
diversify the sources of the firm’s income by pursuing conglomeration. This smooths the
firm’s income stream because with many product lines operating, positive and negative
shocks tend to cancel each other out. The derived income stream of the firm’s executives
is also smoother. Even shareholders might prefer this approach if, in the absence of such
diversification, the firm would have to pay its executives higher salaries to compensate them
for the greater risk. This may be particularly true for managers who are heavily invested in
the firms so that not only their labor income but also their capital income is subject to the
same risk.

Some evidence in support of diversification as a means of diversifying managerial risk is
found in studies by Ahimud and Lev (1981) and by May (1995). The first of these studies
finds that when no shareholder owns 10 percent or more of the stock and management
control is high, firms tend to be more diversified. May (1995) finds that a comparison of
CEOs in terms of the proportion of their wealth invested in the firm reveals that as this
proportion rises, CEOs tend to favor conglomeration.

There are also less attractive or more self-serving managerial goals that may be pursued
through conglomeration. These include entrenchment and rent-seeking. It may be more
difficult to replace managers who run more complicated firms. Obvious candidates to replace
the existing CEO and other executives may be hard to find when the firm is a complex
conglomerate. Similarly, the more complex the organization, the more difficult it is for
shareholders to monitor management and to guard against managers skimming off profits
to their own benefit. These problems are sufficiently real that shares in a conglomerate
are often considered low-priced and subject to a conglomerate discount [Aggarwal and
Samwick (2003)].

performance of the company’s share price over the next five years. See F. M. Biddle, “Boeing Links

16.6 A BRIEF DIGRESSION ON MERGERS AND THE THEORY OF
THE FIRM


A merger involves the acquisition of one company by another. As a result of that purchase,
the acquiring firm gets the physical capital—buildings, equipment, and land—and perhaps
certain intangible assets, such as reputation or brand name, that formerly belonged to the
acquired company. The ultimate question raised by any merger is, what does the change in
ownership permit the merged firm to do that could not be done before?

In the case of a horizontal merger, the possibility of enhanced market power is clearly
part of the motivation. Yet we often see horizontal mergers in which such an increase in
market power may not occur. The merger paradox discussed in the last chapter suggests
that increases in market power as the result of a merger could be rare. In the case of a
vertical merger, the market power motivation is even more suspect. If the upstream and
downstream firms each had 5 percent of their respective markets before the merger, little
seems changed by moving the ownership of those market shares from two different firms
to two different divisions of the same firm.

With upstream-downstream firms, there is the issue of double marginalization. We have
suggested a vertical merger as a response to that problem. It is not the only response, however.
Various contracts between two vertically related firms could be written to overcome the
problem of double marginalization, and these contracts do not require integrating the two
firms into one. We will examine such contracts in depth in the next chapter. Here we simply
want to raise the question as to why firms merge rather than make use of such contracts.
Alternatively, why don’t more firms merge? What in fact limits the size of a firm? What
stops firms from merging into bigger and bigger firms?

This question is really about what determines the boundaries of a firm. What is the
difference between organizing the production of a commodity through many independent
companies, on the one hand, and organizing that production through many divisions of the
same company, on the other? Viewing the matter in this light makes transparent that what
determines the boundaries of the firm is an important question for industrial organization
theory.

Many alternative theories of the firm have been developed since the late 1970s. There is
sufficient work in this area now for it to make up a course, or a field in itself. Our aim here
is not to cover this material in depth. Instead, we wish simply to offer a brief discussion
of the limits on firm size. Now seems a particularly appropriate point to raise this topic
because a merger, by definition, is a transaction that increases a firm’s size.

Neoclassical theory does not tell us much as to what such a transaction gains for the
parties. Nor does it tell us why firms operate internal divisions rather than “spinning them
off” into individual companies. However, neoclassical theory is not alone in this regard.
Other approaches to the theory of the firm also fall short of a complete answer. Take, for
instance, the agency view of the firm. Under this view, a firm is an organization designed to
generate the proper incentives when the various parties engaged in the production process
have different and private information. For example, a supplier of glass may contract
with an automobile producer to provide windshields of a particular quantity and quality
according to a particular schedule. Obviously, the actual quality of such windshields is
beyond the complete control of the glass supplier but the supplier does know whether it
exerted its full effort to supplying the specified quality. The automaker, though, is not so
well informed. It cannot be sure whether a batch of low-quality glass is due to bad luck
or, instead, bad faith on the part of its supplier. Agency theory has generated extremely


452 Contractual Relations Between Firms


useful insights into the types of contracts that might be used to surmount such informational
problems and provide the proper incentives for both parties to live up to their contractual
obligations. Yet it does not tell us whether such contracts must be between two separate
firms, as in the automaker and the glass supplier of our story, or whether the contract
could simply be the incentive scheme offered to the windshield division of a giant car
manufacturer.

Similar problems arise with the transactions cost approach to the firm. Under that
approach, the firm is viewed as an organization designed to minimize the costs of
negotiating, interpreting, enforcing, and renegotiating contracts. However, the precise
mechanism by which this cost reduction is achieved is not typically spelled out. There is no
reason, _a priori_, to assume that haggling is less of a problem between two divisions within
one firm than between two separate firms.

The issue of corporate mergers reveals a weakness in economic theory regarding the
limits or boundaries of a firm’s activities. Why is it that we observe General Motors
supplying autobodies internally rather than purchasing them from an independent supplier?
What advantages are gained and then lost when these divisions are instead independent
firms?

One answer is provided in the work of Hart (1995) and centers on the issue of ownership.
A merger changes the ownership of assets and ownership gives control. The carmaker
that owns its own windshield supply unit is in a position to resolve, by itself, any dispute
between its assembly line and the glass unit. This does not necessarily minimize the cost
of haggling. However, common ownership may permit investments that increase efficiency
that would be less likely to occur otherwise.

Suppose that there is specific machinery that can be used to produce, inexpensively,
windshields of a quality and style unique to the automaker in question. An independent
glass company might not invest in such equipment because it ties the glassmaker too closely
to supplying the particular auto firm. If the glass supplier did make the investment, its
bargaining position in disputes with the automaker would be weak because it has no other
buyer for the one product that this machinery permits it to make. From the perspective
of the glass supplier, it is less risky to use more general equipment that makes it easy to
produce glass products for other firms as well. This is true even though the use of such
generic processes requires the firm to incur an extra cost to mold the windshield to the
specific dimensions specified by the carmaker.

A merger or acquisition of the glass company by the automaker offers a way out. By
operating windshield production as a unit within its own firm, the automaker removes
the potential conflict. Now, the specialized machinery can be bought and the windshields
produced at lower cost because there is no longer any friction over how the gains from this
investment will be shared. They all go to the one, common owner of the assets.

In other words, common ownership is desirable whenever there are complementarities—or synergies—between different assets. As a result, we should expect firms
to combine whenever such complementarities are present—and to split apart if such complementarities vanish. Because technological changes are ever present, and because such
innovations are constantly altering the extent of production complementarities, we should
also expect a constant fluctuation in the size and organization of firms. This approach may
help explain the recent wave of mergers in the telecommunications industry where rapid
innovations have greatly altered the production technology.

16.7 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: VERTICAL INTEGRATION IN
THE READY-MIXED CONCRETE INDUSTRY


Ready-mixed concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials. It consists
mainly of cement, water, and aggregates such as sand and gravel. Of these, cement is
clearly crucial as the binding agent that hardens the aggregates into a solid mass. Almost
invariably, cement makes up 12 percent of the concrete mixture by weight. Hence, cement
and ready-mixed concrete match the assumptions of the Salinger (1988) and Ordover,
Saloner, and Salop (1990) models in that cement is an upstream product used in fixed
proportion per unit of the downstream product, ready-mixed concrete. This makes it an
ideal industry in which to study the effects of vertical integration. [12]

Ali Hortac¸su and Chad Syverson (2007) point out that there is a further aspect of the
concrete business that makes studying vertical integration in that industry interesting. This is
the fact that the different phases of antitrust policy over the late twentieth century were very
much evidenced in the ready-mixed concrete market. In the 1960s, cement makers were
interested in integrating forward into ready-mixed concrete and the percentage of vertically
integrated plants rose steadily throughout the decade. Fearing that these consolidations
would lead to foreclosure and anticompetitive price squeezes, the Justice Department filed
fifteen antitrust cases in this industry and each one led to divestiture. This vigorous policy
also deterred further mergers with the result that during the 1970s, the fraction of cement
firms that were vertically integrated fell noticeably. Then came the 1980s and rise of the
“Chicago School” approach to antitrust policy, which viewed vertical integration much
more favorably. There was a new wave of mergers that again sharply increased the extent
of vertical integration in the concrete market. Finally, in the 1990s, the “post-Chicago”
school began to make its influence felt and antitrust policy became less lenient. Vertical
integration in concrete again declined. This pattern is shown in Table 16.1 below.

Of course, transport costs are far too high for there to be one, national market for
ready-mixed concrete. Using Commerce Department data, Hortac¸su and Syverson (2007)
identify 348 local markets over the years 1963 to 1997. They then use this data to determine
whether the differences in ready-mixed concrete prices across markets are systematically
related to the extent of vertical integration in those markets. A simple regression aimed
average concrete price (measured in logs) in marketat answering this question might have the form: _P iit_ = in year _A_ + _t β_ ; A is an intercept term; VI _VIit_ + _eit,_ where _Pit_ is the _it_
is the market share of output accounted for by vertically integrated firms in market _i_ in year
_t_ ; and _eit_ is a random error term centered on zero. Such a simple model, though, leaves out

many other variables that are likely to be important in determining concrete prices in any
given market-year, and therefore would lead to a biased estimate of the coefficient _β_ .

To begin with, the average price over time might be different in each market. There might
be something about the Chicago market, for example, that makes its price of cement always
relatively high. This effect can be handled by letting the intercept term vary across each
market. Then too, industrial organization theory suggests that market structure, as measured
by the Herfindahl Index (HI), could also be important for the behavior of prices, as might be
the level of demand coming from the local construction industry in that year. In fact, given
our discussion of antitrust policy, we might also think that the precise year is important as
well because firms might try to keep prices low in years when antitrust pressure is more
intense than in years when it is lenient. We need to control for such time-specific factors
and the many other forces that could affect concrete prices if we are to isolate the influence
of changes in vertical integration alone. The easiest way to do this is to include measures of
concentration and local demand and put in a dummy variable for each market and each year.

Hortac¸su and Syverson (2007) make the foregoing adjustments and some others as well
to estimate regressions explaining the variation in concrete prices across markets and time.
Their central results are shown in Table 16.2 below.

In all the regressions, results for the time and market dummies are suppressed, as are those
for the HI and construction demand, which are never significant. The first column shows
the results when, apart from the control variables just mentioned, the only explanatory
variable is the extent of vertical integration in the local market. This effect is both negative
and statistically significant. It is also economically meaningful. For their entire sample,
Hortac¸su and Syverson (2007) find that on average, vertically integrated firms account for
31.5 percent of the typical market. The estimated coefficient shown in the first column then
implies that ready-mixed concrete prices would be 4 percent lower in such a market than
they would be in a market with no vertically integrated firms. Thus, this result suggests that
the efficiency results of vertical integration typically outweigh any anticompetitive effects
so that consumers benefit.

The next two columns test additional variables that may be important for concrete prices.
In column 2, a second independent variable is added for the fraction of firms that operate
more than one plant. This includes all the vertically integrated firms plus all those that
operate multiple plants horizontally. Including this variable is a means of testing whether

the vertically integrated variable is really capturing efficiencies that come from coordinating
different plants, e.g., better-timed production, lower transport costs, rather than from vertical
integration _per se_ . However this variable is insignificant and does not materially affect the
results in column 1.

The third column is perhaps the most interesting. Here, Hortac¸su and Syverson (2007)
include as an additional regressor a measure of average productivity in the local market.
This is clearly an important variable. Including it reduces the magnitude of the effects of
vertical integration and eliminates their statistical significance. What are the implications
of this finding?

First, it makes intuitive sense that concrete prices will be lower in markets where firms
are more productive. In this sense, the results in column 3 are not surprising. Second, we
should recall that vertical integration has potentially two effects, a price-reducing effect due
to greater efficiency and a price-increasing effect due to foreclosure-type forces. Including
the productivity variable should control for any efficiency effects so that the vertical
integration term now picks up only the price-increasing impact of vertical mergers. The
findings in column 3 suggest that once this control for efficiency effects is included, the
price-increasing effects appear very weak. Finally, Hortac¸su and Syverson (2007) produce
other evidence to show that vertically integrated firms have higher productivity. If vertical
integration in this industry has an impact on prices, it does so through the efficiency effect.
Overall, these results imply that vertical integration has been welfare-enhancing and good
for consumers, at least in the ready-mixed concrete business.


**Summary**



We have considered two broad types of merger
in this chapter: vertical and conglomerate. A vertical merger typically involves the merging of
companies operating at different stages of production in the same product line. A conglomerate
merger is a merger of two firms that have little or
no common markets or products.

Vertical mergers raise complicated issues. On
the one hand, such mergers can benefit firms and
consumers by eliminating double marginalization. On the other hand, they may be a means to
foreclose either upstream or downstream markets
to rivals, and to facilitate price discrimination.
There is no simple way of determining which of
these forces is likely to be the stronger. Some
argue that the negative impact of potential vertical foreclosure itself sets up a countervailing
force that will induce remaining independent
companies to integrate as well. If so, this can
reduce inefficiencies still further. However, we
have seen that the vertically integrated firm may
have both the means and the motive to prevent
such subsequent mergers. Resolution of these
issues in any particular case must, as always,
depend on careful evaluation of the realities of
the specific situation.



It is worth noting, however, that even when
foreclosure and a price squeeze for independent
rivals does happen, it may nonetheless be the case
that final consumers are made better off with the
vertical merger. Policy makers should therefore
not be too hasty in condemning a vertical merger
simply because it disadvantages rival firms. The
goal of antitrust policy is to preserve the benefits
of competition, not the fortunes of competitors.

Conglomerate mergers probably raise the
fewest problems from an antitrust perspective.
However, for this very reason, the motivation for
such mergers can be difficult to identify. They
may reflect an attempt to minimize risk either for
stockholders or managers. But there would seem
to be other means to achieve these same ends.

The ambiguous effects of mergers that characterize our economic models are also found
in empirical analysis. To date, there is little
clear evidence that vertical mergers have led
to significant increases in monopoly power. A
recent study of the ready-mixed concrete industry suggests that such vertical integration tends
to bring greater productive efficiency and lower
consumer prices. The combination of ambiguity in the theory and, if anything, favorable


456 Contractual Relations Between Firms


empirical evidence has led the legal authorities to take a much less aggressive and much
less rigid stand against proposed vertical mergers. Today these are inevitably handled on a


**Problems**


1. Norman International has a monopoly in
the manufacture of _whatsits_ . Each _whatsit_
requires exactly one _richet_ as an input and
incurs other variable costs of $5 per unit.
_Richets_ are made by PepRich Inc., which is
also a monopoly. The variable costs of manufacturing _richets_ are $5 per unit. Assume
that the inverse demand for _whatsits_ is:


_pw_ 50 _qw_
=     
where _pw_ is the price of _whatsits_ in dollars
per unit and _qw_ is the quantity of _whatsits_
offered for sale by Norman International.
a. Write down the profit function for
Norman International assuming that
the two monopolists act as independent profit-maximizing companies,
with Norman International setting a
price _pw_ for _whatsits_ and PepRich
setting a price _pr_ for _richets_ . Hence,
derive the profit-maximizing price for
_whatsits_ as a function of the price of
richets, and use this function to obtain
the derived demand for _richets_ .
b. Use your answer in (a) to write down
the profit function for PepRich. Hence,
derive the profit-maximizing price of
_richets_ . Use this to derive the profitmaximizing price of _whatsits_ . Calculate the sales of _whatsits_ (and so of
_richets_ ) and calculate the profits of the
two firms.


2. Now assume that these two firms merge to
form NPR International.
a. Write down the profit function for NPR
given that it sets a price _pw_ for _what-_
_sits_ . Calculate the postmerger profitmaximizing price for _whatsits_, sales of
_whatsits_, and the profits of NPR.
b. Confirm that this merger has increased
the joint profits of the two firms while
reducing the price charged to consumers. By how much has consumer

economic data—this is the best approach to
follow.


surplus been increased by the merger
in the market for _whatsits_ ?
c. Assume that the two firms expect to
last forever and that the discount factor _R_ is 0.9. What is the largest sum
that PepRich would be willing to pay
the owners of Norman International to
take over Norman International? What
is the lowest sum that the owners of
Norman International would be willing
to accept? (Hint: Calculate the present
value of the profit streams of the two
firms before and after the merger, and
notice that neither firm will want to
be worse off with the takeover than
without it.)


3. Now assume that PepRich gets the opportunity to sell to an overseas market for
_whatsits_, controlled by a monopolist FC Hu
Inc., which has the same operating costs in
making _whatsits_ as Norman International.
PepRich knows that it will have to pay
transport costs of $2 per _richet_ to supply
the overseas market. Inverse demand for
_whatsits_ in this market is


_pw_ 40 _qw/_ 2
=     
a. Repeat your calculations for question
1(a).
b. The authorities in the overseas market
are contemplating taking an antidumping action, accusing PepRich of dumping _richets_ into its market. They calculate that by doing so, they will
induce PepRich to offer to take over FC
Hu. Assume that PepRich has limited
access to funds, so that it can take over
only one of the two firms Norman International and FC Hu. Are the overseas
authorities correct in their calculations?
(Hint: Compare the maximum amounts
that PepRich would be willing to pay
for Norman International and FC Hu.)


4. Go back to the conditions of question 1,
so that PepRich is supplying only Norman International. But now assume that
the manufacture of each _whatsit_ requires
exactly one _richet_ and one _zabit_ . Zabits
are made by ZabCor, another monopolist, whose variable costs are $2.50 per
_zabit_ .
a. Assume that the three firms act independently to maximize profit. Calculate
the resulting prices of _richets_, _zabits_,
and _whatsits_ and the profits of the three
firms.
b. Assume an infinite life for all three
firms and a discount factor _R_ = 0.9.
PepRich and ZabCor are each contemplating a takeover of Norman International. Which of these two companies would win the bidding for
Norman International? What will be
the effect of the winning takeover on
consumer surplus in the market for
_whatsits_ ?


5. As an alternative to buying Norman International, the owners of PepRich and ZabCor
contemplate merging to form PRZ, which
will control the manufacture of both _richets_
and _zabits_ .
a. Calculate the impact of this merger on
(1) the prices of _richets_, _zabit_ s, and
_whatsits_, (2) the profits of these firms,
and (3) consumer surplus in the _whatsit_
market.
b. Which merger will be preferred

i. by consumers of _whatsits_ ?
ii. by the owners of PepRich and ZabCorp.?
iii. by the owners of Norman International?


6. (More difficult) Ginvir and Sipep are
Bertrand competitors selling differentiated
products in the carbonated drinks market.
The demands for the products of the two
firms being given by the inverse demand
functions:


_pG_ = 25 − 2 _qG_   - _qS_ for Ginvir and

_pS_ = 25 − 2 _qS_    - _qG_ for Sipep.

Both companies need syrup to make their
drinks; the syrup is supplied by two competing companies, NorSyr and BenRup. These
companies incur costs of $5 per unit in
making the syrup. Both Ginvir and Sipep
can use the syrup of either supplier.
a. Confirm that competition between
NorSyr and BenRup leads to the syrup
being priced at $5 per unit.
b. What are the resulting equilibrium
prices for Ginrip and Sipep and what
are their profits?


7. Now suppose that Ginvir and NorSyr merge
and that NorSyr no longer competes for
Sipep’s business.
a. What price will Benrup now charge
Sipep for the syrup?
b. What are the resulting profits to the
three post-merger companies?
c. Do Benrup and Sipep have an incentive
also to merge?


8. Return to the model of Cournot competition
presented in Section 16.3. Show that when
both pairs of upstream-downstream firms
vertically integrate, total industry profit
falls below what it was with no vertical
integration.


9. [Hart and Tirole (1990)]. Consider a
monopolist upstream supplier _U_ 1 selling to two downstream producers _D_ 1
and _D_ 2 engaged in Cournot competition. Downstream demand is described by:
_P_ = 100 − _Q_ and marginal cost is zero at
both the upstream and downstream level.
a. Show that the monopoly level of output is 50 and that monopoly profit is
$2500.
b. Imagine a contract by which _U_ 1 sells
25 units as a package to each of _D_ 1
and _D_ 2 at a price of $1,250. Each firm
can either accept the package or reject
it. Show that if decisions are made
simultaneously, and each firm has full
information about the other’s actions,
the Nash Equilibrium is for each to
accept this offer.


10. Imagine now that deals between _U_ 1 and
_U_ 2 are done in secret. This can be thought


458 Contractual Relations Between Firms


of as raising the possibility that one player
goes first. If that player accepts 25 units at a
package price of $1,250, _U_ 1 can then offer
a second package to the other retailer.
a. Show that in a sequential setting the
first downstream firm will never accept
_U_ 1’s offer.

# **17** **Vertical Price Restraints**

You may never have heard of Seagate or Western Digital. Yet, chances are, you have used
their products. Together, these two firms produced roughly 90 percent of the hard drives
used in computers, including laptops and the computers that run the “cloud.” This means
that the customers to whom Seagate and Western Digital sell are firms such as Apple, Dell,
and Hewlett-Packard. In turn, these firms assemble their desktop and laptop computers and
sell them to retailers including Best Buy and Staples. Apple, of course, maintains its own
retail outlets as well.

Vertical chains such as that connecting the hard drive maker to the computer retailer are
common. ArcelorMittal and other steel companies sell their product to auto manufacturers
(among others) who, in turn, assemble finished auto products and distribute these to dealers
for final retail sales. Mattel Toys sells its _Barbie_ doll, _Fisher-Price_, and _Hot Wheels_ products
through retailers such as Toys ‘R’ Us and Wal-Mart. Kellogg’s sells its ready-to-eat cereals
through supermarkets such as Kroger and Safeway. Relations at each step require contracts.
Seagate and Western Digital sign contracts with Apple, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard and
these firms in turn have contracts governing their relations with Best Buy, Staples, and other
retailers. The steel firms sign contracts with the auto companies who in turn sign contacts
with the car dealers and so on.

The contracts signed by the firms in these production and distribution chains inevitably
impose restrictions on the signatory parties. Suppliers may be required to guarantee quality
and to help with final sales promotion. Retailers may be required to display the product
prominently and to offer various services. Because they take place in the context of the
vertical supply chain, these restrictions are typically referred to as vertical restraints. While
they may help the firms better coordinate their efforts they can also restrict competition
on two levels. First, there is the possibility that vertical restraints may be used to suppress
competition between different manufactured goods. That is, the fact that Apple, Dell, and
Hewlett-Packard all sell through Best Buy may enable these firms to suppress competition
between their different brands, i.e., it may suppress interbrand competition. Alternatively,
the fact that different Best Buy establishments are each selling, say, Dell computers may
allow for the coordination of Dell pricing thereby suppressing intrabrand competition.

Traditionally, concerns with the competitive effects of vertical restraints have distinguished between those constraints that focus on price and those that focus on non-price


460 Contractual Relations Between Firms


decisions. We follow this dichotomy here. In this chapter, we examine vertical price
restraints. We investigate the effects of vertical non-price restraints in the following chapter.


17.1 ANTITRUST POLICY TOWARD VERTICAL PRICE
CONSTRAINTS: HISTORY AND THEORY


The principle type of retail price restriction is Resale Price Maintenance (RPM). Under such
an agreement, the upstream firm such as the manufacturer imposes either an upper level
that the retail price cannot exceed, or a floor price that the retail price cannot fall below.
Because they are explicitly an agreement on price, all such contractual provisions were for
many years considered to be a _per se_ violation of the US antitrust laws beginning with the
_Dr. Miles_ case decided by the US Supreme Court in 1911. [1] This was true regardless of
whether the contract specified a minimum or a maximum downstream price.

However, exceptions to this blanket approach crept in rather quickly. In the _Colgate_ case
of 1919, the Supreme Court ruled that if a producer unilaterally announced that it would
terminate any firm that sold below a specified retail price, it could then proceed to do just
that and to cut off downstream firms that violated that pricing policy because the unilateral
quality of the decision meant that there really was no price agreement. [2] Then in the wake
of the Great Depression, the US Congress passed the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937, which
explicitly exempted RPM agreements from antitrust prosecution. This was later followed
by the 1952 McGuire Act, which permitted the enforcement of an RPM agreement even
on firms who had not signed on to the arrangement, provided at least one retailer and
manufacturer had agreed to it.

The one loophole in the Miller-Tydings and McGuire legislation was that it required
participation by state legislatures to make it effective. Some states, however, continued
to prohibit RPM agreements so that in these states, RPM agreements did not become
legal. Over time, this led to a discrepancy between prices in those states in which RPM
was legal and those in which it was not. In 1975, in the wake of the substantial inflation
induced by OPEC’s four-fold increase in the price of crude oil, both the Miller-Tydings and
the McGuire Acts were repealed. This reestablished the strong presumption of illegality
applying to all RPM agreements. It did not remove the ability of manufacturers to cut off
discount dealers established by the _Colgate_ decision.

Three subsequent legal cases have greatly expanded the ability of manufacturers to
impose retail price restrictions. In the _Sharp Electronics_ case, [3] the Court broadened its
_Colgate_ exception by permitting the manufacturer to terminate a discount dealer even if this
termination was the result of other dealers’ complaints. Then, in the 1997 _State Oil vs. Khan_
case, the Court moved to renounce explicitly any _per se_ illegality for RPM agreements
establishing a _maximum_ price or a price ceiling. Most recently, in the _Leegin_ case of 2007,
the Court reversed the _Dr. Miles per se_ ruling and held that all resale price agreements,
maximum or minimum, should be subject to a rule of reason test. In short, despite the initial
_Dr. Miles_ 1911 ruling, exceptions and exemptions to that _per se_ approach have always been
part of the legal framework governing RPM agreements. With the _Khan_ and _Leegin_ cases,

_Doctrine_ .

those exceptions have become the rule, so that RPM agreements are now evaluated using a
rule of reason approach.


17.2 VERTICAL PRICE RESTRAINTS AS A RESPONSE TO
DOUBLE-MARGINALIZATION


As noted, vertical price restraints can enable the vertically linked firms to better coordinate
their decisions. This can benefit consumers as well as the firms. The most prevalent example
of such a positive effect of an RPM is the double-marginalization problem discussed in the
last chapter. Recall the basic argument. A monopoly manufacturer with constant marginal
cost sells to a monopoly retailer whose only marginal cost is assumed, for simplicity, to be
the upstream or wholesale price _P_ _[U]_ . Given retail demand of _P_ _[D]_ = A − B _Q,_ the retailer


462 Contractual Relations Between Firms


maximizes profit by setting a retail price of _P_ _[D]_ = _(_ A + _P_ _[U]_ _)/_ 2. In order for the upstream
manufacturer to earn a profit, however, the wholesale price must include a markup _m_ above
cost, i.e., _P_ _[U]_ = _c_ + _m_ . Accordingly, the retail price will be: _P_ _[D]_ = _(_ A + _c_ + _m)/_ 2. Yet the
retail price that maximizes upstream and downstream profit combined is: _P_ _[D]_ [∗] = _(_ A + _c)/_ 2.
Thus, unless the manufacturer foregoes all profit and sets _m_ equal to zero—unless it resolves
the double markup problem by removing one of the markups—the downstream price will
be higher than the price that maximizes the total profit of the two firms.

In Chapter 16, we demonstrated that this double-marginalization issue could be addressed
by a vertical merger. However, an RPM agreement offers an alternative resolution. Under an
RPM agreement, the manufacturer can stipulate a maximum retail price equal to the jointprofit-maximizing price of _P_ _[D]_ [∗] = _(_ A + _c)/_ 2. If the manufacturer also sets the wholesale
price at this level—if it sets _m_ = _(_ A − _c)/_ 2 —then the manufacturer can in principle
appropriate the entire maximum profit. In reality, this may be difficult and the manufacturer
may have to settle for a smaller markup while still keeping the price at _P_ _[D]_ [∗] = _(_ A + _c)/_ 2.
The crucial point to make is that _P_ _[D]_ [∗] is not only the retail price that maximizes the total
profit pie going to the manufacturer and retailer, and therefore one that any RPM should
specify; it is also a lower retail price than would occur in the absence of an RPM. Hence,
the RPM agreement benefits producers, dealers, _and_ consumers.

Note though that there is an alternative solution to the manufacturer’s problem. This is
to use a two-part pricing contract similar to those discussed in Chapter 6. Specifically, the
manufacturer could sell to the retailer at a wholesale price _r_ equal to marginal cost _c_ . This
would induce the retailer to set the monopoly profit-maximizing price of _P_ _[D]_ = _(_ A + _c)/_ 2
and earn the maximum profit _(_ A − _c)_ [2] _/_ 4B _,_ which the manufacturer can then capture with
an up-front fee. We return to this point later in the chapter.


Toy Store, the only such store in the area. Demand for the trains at the retail store level in
inverse form is _P_ = 1000 − 2 _Q,_ where _Q_ is the total number of trains sold. The Great Toy
Store incurs no service cost in selling the trains. Its only cost is the wholesale price it pays
for each train. Tiger-el incurs a production cost of $40 per train.


a. What wholesale price should Tiger-el charge for its trains? What price will these trains
sell for at retail? How many trains will be sold?
b. What profit will the toy store and the retailer earn under the pricing choices found in
part (a)?
c. What would be the retail price and the quantity sold if Tiger-el sold the trains to the
toy store at cost but received a 66.67 percent sales royalty on every train sold? What
would each firm’s profit now be?


17.3 RPM AGREEMENTS AND RETAIL PRICE DISCRIMINATION


As we saw early in this book a retailer that is able to determine “who is who” on its demand
curve and separate consumers into different groups will find it profitable to charge the
different groups different prices, with the highest prices charged to those customers with
least elastic demand. Coupons, quantity discounts, variations in quality in which the price
difference does not match the cost difference, and market segmentation are all mechanisms


Vertical Price Restraints 463


by which a retailer may price discriminate. However, while such price discrimination can
enhance retail profits, it can make life difficult for the upstream manufacturer.

To see how retail price discrimination can raise problems for the manufacturer, consider
the following simple example. A retailer serves two separate markets. In each market, retail
demand is characterized by _P_ = 100 − _Q_ and, again, the only retail cost is the wholesale
price per unit _r_ set by the manufacturer. In one market, the retailer is a monopolist. In the
other, the retailer faces Bertrand competition from a rival who also buys at _r_ per unit from
the manufacturer. The retailer can add a markup to the wholesale price _r_ in the first market,
but in the second, Bertrand competition forces the retail price to be equal to _r_ . We assume
that the manufacturer’s unit cost is _c_ = $20.

Although one retailer sells in two markets, we assume that the manufacturer cannot sign
a separate contract with that retailer for the goods sold in each market. We also assume that
where there is more than one retailer, the manufacturer must offer each the same terms.
In other words, while a retailer may be able to discriminate, the manufacturer cannot.
To avoid the double-marginalization problem, we will allow this one contract to specify
both a wholesale price _r_ and an up-front franchise fee _T_ . The manufacturer’s problem is
to choose _T_ and _r_ to maximize its total profit. A little algebra quickly reveals that the
profit-maximizing monopoly price in each market is $60. If this price can be made to stick,
each market will generate $1,600 in profit.

Without an RPM agreement, the manufacturer’s choice of _r_ and _T_ imposes a clear
tradeoff. The conventional strategy of setting _r_ equal to marginal cost _c_ = $20 and using
the fixed fee _T_ to claim the profits this strategy generates works well in the monopolized
market. There, the retailer facing _r_ = _c_ = $20 _,_ will set price _P_ _[D]_ = $60 and the maximum
monopoly profit of $1,600 will be achieved. However, competition in the remaining market
will mean that the wholesale price will also be the retail price in that market, _P_ _[D]_ = _r,_
because both retailers buy upstream at price _r_ . As a result, there will be no profit to be
claimed in this market by any fixed payment _T_ . The only two-part tariff that can work
for both markets is one with _T_ = 0 _,_ which is really just a single-part tariff. Recognizing
this, the manufacturer will find it profitable simply to set _r_ = $60 (and _T_ = 0). In this
case, the competitive market price is also $60 and the manufacturer earns $1,600 in that
market. Unfortunately, with _r_ = $60 _,_ the retailer will set a price of _P_ _[D]_ [−] = $80 in its
monopolized market so that only 20 units are sold. The manufacturer will then earn only
_(_ $60 − $20 _)_ × 20 = $800 in profit from this market—half of the expected $1,600.

In the Appendix to this chapter, we show that, without an RPM agreement, the best that
the manufacturer can do in this case is to set a wholesale price of $52 _,_ which results in
a combined profit from both markets of $2,304. The retail prices in the monopolized and
competitive market are then, respectively, $76 and $52. Relative to the profit maximizing
retail price of $60 in each market, the price is too high in the monopolized market and too
low in the competitive market.

The appeal of an RPM agreement in this setting should be clear. The manufacturer can
continue to forego the fixed fee (set _T_ = 0) but now set a wholesale price of _r_ = $60
while imposing an RPM agreement that the retail price can never exceed this amount. This
will lead to the desired retail price of $60 in each market and of course, the maximum
manufacturer total profit of $3,200.

While the two-market story told above is somewhat contrived, it nonetheless serves as
a useful illustration of a general principle. Whatever the source of a retailer’s ability to
discriminate in prices, such discrimination makes it difficult for the upstream manufacturer
to establish a wholesale contract that maximizes the total, manufacturing, and retail profit
