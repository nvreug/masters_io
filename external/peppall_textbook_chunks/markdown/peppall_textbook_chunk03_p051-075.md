In other words, the maximum price that the monopolist can set in the first period in order







$20
$30
+ 1 _R_
+







to sell just one unit is _(_ 1 + _R)_



= _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30 + $20.



In light of the above, we can now greatly simplify the monopolist’s problem. Either sell
two units in the first period each at a price of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30; or one unit in the first period at
a price of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30 + $20 and a second unit in the following period at a price of $30;
or no units in the first period but both units in the second period at a price of $30. The
corresponding profits are shown in Table 2.1.

A little algebra will confirm that the first row option in Table 2.1 gives the greatest profit
in present value terms. That is, the monopolist will maximize profit by setting a first-period
price of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30 and selling both units immediately, one to each consumer. The monopolist will then earn a surplus of 2 _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30. The high-value consumer will earn a surplus
of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $20, while the low-value consumer will earn zero surplus. The total surplus
will thus be 2 _(_ 1 + _R)_ $30 + _(_ 1 + _R)_ $20 = _(_ 1 + _R)_ $80, the maximum amount possible. In
other words, the durable feature of the good has constrained the monopolist to set efficient
prices—ones that maximize the surplus. This is Coase’s conjecture. It is the supposition
that durability constrains monopoly pricing so as to eliminate any deadweight loss.

However, just as the efficacy of entry as a discipline on monopoly behavior can be
weakened, so too can the impact of durability. Consider how the above example would
have been altered had the low-value consumer only valued the services of the durable good
at $20 per period or _(_ 1 + _R)_ $20 in total. In this case, it is now no longer the case that
any and all second-period sales must take place at the maximum price of the low-value
consumer, which is now $20. If the monopolist sells no units in the first-period and enters
the second-period with two units to sell, it will be preferable to sell just one unit to the
high-value consumer at $50 rather than both units at $20 a piece. It follows that the highvalue consumer can no longer bargain so aggressively in the first period. This consumer
will now prefer any price of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $ _(_ 50 − _ε)_ in the first period that provides a surplus
of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $ _ε_ to a price of $50 in the second-period that provides a surplus of zero. Thus,
by making _ε_ arbitrarily small, the monopolist can induce the high-value consumer to buy
in the first period, and then sell at a price of $20 to the low-value consumer in the second
period. Neither consumer will enjoy any surplus, while the monopolist will earn a profit of
_(_ 1 + _R)_ $50 + _R_ $20. As can be easily verified, the maximum surplus available in this case
is _(_ 1 + _R)_ $70, which is $20 greater than the surplus actually realized. Here, durability has
not eliminated the deadweight loss of monopoly.

The difference in the two cases reflects the distribution of consumer valuations. In both
cases, this distribution is discrete. However, the jump from one valuation to the next is
more substantial in the second case. Heuristically, valuations are less continuous in that
setting. This points to a generalization regarding the Coase conjecture. The more that

consumer valuations are continuous, the more that durability constrains monopoly pricing
of durable goods to be efficient. Indeed, as the distribution becomes perfectly continuous,
the monopolist may be forced to set competitive prices. In general, durability will, like
potential entry, impose some limits on the exploitation of monopoly power and the extent
of the associated welfare loss. [13]


2.3.4 The Nonsurplus Approach to Economic Efficiency [14]


Let us return to the second example in the discussion of the Coase conjecture above in
which the Coase conjecture fails. Recall that the efficient first-period price is _(_ 1 + _R)_ $20
resulting in a total surplus of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $70, but that the monopolist instead sets an initial
price of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50 and a subsequent second-period price of $20, resulting in a deadweight
loss of $20. We may ask now how matters might be different had there been fifty high-value
consumers and fifty low-value ones again assuming that the monopolist has just two units.

The first thing to note is that the total surplus now available on the market is 2 _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50.
At a first-period price of _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50, two units will be sold to two of the 50 high-value
consumers and all of this surplus will go to the monopolist. In fact, no other price is possible.
None would buy at a higher price. Moreover, at any lower price, the high-value consumers
would actively compete with higher bids until again the price rose to _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50. Here is
another case in which profit maximization by the monopolist is consistent with efficient
resource allocation.

Why does this happen here? Why is it that now, despite the sizeable differences in
consumer valuations between the two groups, monopoly pricing involves no deadweight
loss? The answer lies in considering more deeply just what that deadweight loss of monopoly
signifies. The deadweight loss of monopoly is really just the additional surplus that the
monopolist could generate if output were increased to the efficient level. The problem for
the monopolist in the conventional setting, e.g., Figure 2.2(b), is that the monopolist cannot
appropriate the full value of this marginal surplus. As the additional output is sold and
price moves down the demand curve, units are sold at a lower price. Even if the monopolist
captures all the surplus on the marginal units, the net gain is less than this because less is
now earned on infra-marginal units.

It is the inability of the monopolist to appropriate all the surplus that production generates
that lies at the heart of the welfare loss of monopoly. When there are fifty high-value
consumers, however, and the monopolist only has two units to sell, this problem no longer
exists. The monopolist can sell the efficient amount without lowering the price to any
infra-marginal consumer. Within the feasible range of sales, the monopolist generates
_(_ 1 + _R)_ $50 of surplus for each unit sold and acquires and keeps all this surplus.

When there are fifty high-value consumers, the monopolist’s output potential is small
relative to the total market. At the margin, the decision to increase or decrease sales by one
unit and sell it at _(_ 1 + _R)_ $50, leaves the surplus of all other market participants unaffected.
The marginal consumer earns a surplus of zero in either case. Note that this is similar to
the perfectly competitive case. There, too, each firm is sufficiently small relative to the
market that it has no effect on the surplus earned by all other participants. The profit of a

single competitive firm at the margin is zero and this is precisely the same as that firm’s
contribution to the surplus or welfare created by market trading. The same can be true for a
monopolist if it is small relative to the overall market.

The understanding that the crucial factor giving rise to inefficient outcomes is that there
are market participants able, at the margin, to alter the surplus of other participants is known
as the non-surplus approach to economic analysis. For our purposes, it makes the important
point that it is not the number of sellers but their size relative to the market that gives rise to
a welfare loss. In other words, it is not the fact that the monopolist is the only seller but the
fact that the monopolist is large relative to the market that leads to inefficient outcomes. [15]


2.4 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: TESTING THE COASE DURABLE
GOODS MODEL


Coase’s argument that monopolists selling durable goods may still face market pressure
to price competitively rests on a very rational model of consumer behavior in which
consumers are assumed to be forward-looking when making today’s buying decisions.
Whether buyers are really that rational, though, is open to question. Judith Chevalier and
Austan Goolsbee (2009) examine this issue by analyzing the college textbook market. Their
intuition is straightforward: If the standard model accurately describes consumer behavior,
then students buying a textbook should consider the likelihood that a new edition will come
out after the student is done with it and wants to sell it back on the used book market. In
particular, the prospect that a new edition will come out soon should depress the student
demand for the book, as this will make it harder to sell a used version.

To investigate this issue, Chevalier and Goolsbee collected data for textbooks in biology,
economics, and psychology for the years 1997 through 2001 by semester and by class. For
each class, they know the assigned textbook and how many people were in the class. They
also know the aggregate new book sales of each text and also the total sales of used versions
of the assigned text through college bookstores. For any textbook _i_ in year _t_, let _Nit_ be the
number of students who bought the text new and _Ait_ be the total number of students in
academic class market that bought the book new. Similarly, letclasses in which the book was assigned. Then _S_ 1 _it_ = _Nit/Ait_ is the share of the potential _S_ 2 _it_ be the share of students
who bought a used version at the college bookstore. Finally, let _S_ 3 _it_ be the share of students
who did not buy the assigned text at all. The variable _S_ 1 _it/S_ 3 _it_ is then a measure of the
demand for a new, unused book relative to not buying the book in any form. It is tempting
to relate this linearly to the price _pit_ of a new book and some other independent variables
X _it_, to give the simple linear:


_S_ 1 _it/S_ 3 _it_ _β_ X _it_ _α_ 1 _pit_ _uit_ (2.7)
=     - +

Here, _β_ is a vector of coefficients on the Xit variables, which include such things as
whether the book is an introductory or advanced text, whether it comes shrink-wrapped with
a study guide and other ancillaries, and the book’s level of difficulty, while _α_ 1 measures
the effect of the book price on student purchases of new, unused texts. However, Chevalier


15 The nonsurplus approach is developed in Makowski and Ostroy (1995). It has had an important influence
on our understanding of market participation. It also plays a central role in the business strategies
advocated by Brandenburger and Nalebuff (1996).

and Goolsbee recognize that because both _S_ 1 _it_ and _S_ 3 _i_ t are positive fractions, their ratio
must also always be positive. Yet it is possible that the data may give rise to estimates
of _β_ and _α_ 1 that predict values below zero. Further, the simple relationship expressed in
equation (2.7) allows no direct test of whether students are forward-looking in their textbook
purchases.

Chevalier and Goolsbee (2009) therefore make two alterations to the simple model above.
First, they make what is known as a logit transformation by using the natural log of the
dependent variable, i.e., by using ln _(S_ 1 _it/S_ 3 _it)_ ln _(S_ 1 _it)_ ln _(S_ 3 _it)_ . Because logarithms
=                   can be negative, this allows the data to “speak freely.” Second, they include a second
price variable = _._ 5 _(_ 1 − _Dit)pit_, where _Dit_ is a 1, 0 dummy variable that takes the value 1 in
any semester in which a new edition of the book is coming out one semester later, and zero
otherwise. The idea behind this second modification is simple. The true price of buying
a new textbook is the price paid for it initially, _pit_, less the discounted price for which
students can sell the book back at the end of the term. Chevalier and Goolsbee find that
this resale price is typically on the order of 50 to 75 percent of the initial price, or 0.5 _pit_,
reflecting a rule of thumb for buybacks that almost all bookstores follow. However, if a
new version of the text is about to come out _(Dit_ 1 _)_, then the resale price falls to zero.
Thus, the true price of purchasing a new book is given by: = _pit_ _R_ 0.5 _(_ 1 _Dit)pit_ . Here, _R_
reflects the discount factor that students apply to the money they will receive in the future − when they sell the book—a variable that is not directly observed.

With these modifications, equation (2.7) becomes:


ln _(S_ 1 _it)_ ln _(S_ 3 _it)_ _β_ X _it_ _α_ 1[ _pit_ _R_ 0.5 _(_ 1 _Dit)pit_ ] _uit_ (2.8)
    - =     -     -     - +

or, more generally,


ln _(S_ 1 _it)_ ln _(S_ 3 _it)_ _β_ X _it_ _α_ 1 _pit_ _α_ 2 _(_ 1 _Dit)pit_ _uit_ (2.9)
    - =     - +     - +


Note that the value of _α_ 2 _α_ 10.5 _R_ and that it indicates whether or not students are
forward-looking. If _α_ 2 0, then students are myopic and consider only the initial price. =
However, if _α_ 2 is not zero, then students do consider a text’s future resale value in their =
original purchase decision, except in years when _Dit_ 1 so that future resale value is zero.
Note as well that we can define the ratio _λ_ _α_ 2 _/α_ 1 = 0.5 _R_ . Hence, if we have estimates
of _α_ 1 and _α_ 2, we can infer the typical student’s discount factor = = _R_ .

Chevalier and Goolsbee (2009) estimate equation (2.9) with alternative regression
techniques (OLS and GMM) including in each case several additional independent variables
_(Xit)_ . These are time dummies to capture general shifts in textbook demand from one year
to the next, for the particular field that the text is in, whether it is bundled with additional
software; the fraction of the time that the book was required for the class and not just
assigned (which is greater than 0.90 for all of the books considered); the average SAT score
of students assigned the book; the age of the edition; and whether it is a paperback. [16] For
the purposes of testing the Coase view and, specifically, the underlying assumption that


16 Students with a knowledge of econometrics may recognize that the price variable is endogenous and that
therefore an instrumental variables (IV) approach is warranted. Chevalier and Goolsbee do indeed adopt
an IV approach, including a dummy variable indicating if a book is published by a non-profit publisher,
the share of non-profit publishers among textbooks designed for the same course, and the Herfindahl
index for publishers for the course in the year in which the textbook was published.

students are forward-looking, we present only their basic results for the price variables.
These are shown in Table 2.2.

These results confirm both the model and the hypothesis that students are definitely
forward-looking. The current price has a highly significant and negative effect on new
textbook demand, while the resale price has a significantly positive effect just as it should
for forward-looking consumers. Indeed, the estimates of _λ_ imply estimated student discount
factors that exceed 1. If this were literally true, it would mean that far from being myopic,
students care more about the future resale value than the initial purchase price in buying
a text. However, the estimate of _λ_ is not so precise that one can rule out more normal,
one-semester discount factors of say _R_ = 0.98.

In short, the Chevalier and Goolsbee (2009) estimates imply that consumers, or at least
college students taking biology, economics, and psychology classes, are forward-looking.
Indeed, the difference in price sensitivity of these students differs dramatically in years
in which a new version of the text is not anticipated _(Dit_ 0 _)_ and years in which one
is _(Dit_ 1 _)_ . In the former case, the estimates in Table 2.2 imply that a 10 percent rise =
in the initial purchase price will decrease initial sales by only 16.3 percent because they =
plan on getting half of that price increase back at the end of the term. In contrast, for
students expecting no resale because of an anticipated new edition, a 10 percent price rise
on the initial purchase leads to a nearly 40 percent decline in sales. Perhaps somewhat
paradoxically, then, the presence of a resale market leads to higher initial prices as students
are more willing to pay those prices if they believe that can resell the book later.

As authors of a textbook ourselves, we know that it is widely believed among students
that new editions are introduced to raise profits by eliminating competition from used
books. Yet Chevalier and Goolsbee (2009) show that their estimates imply that there is no
such incentive for economics textbooks because given how forward-looking students are
and how sensitive they are to a book’s expected resale value, the expected sales revenue for
economics texts varies little with the frequency of revision. Faster revisions means lower
initial sales in a manner that basically cancels out any gain from eliminating used book
competition. This evidence thus lends fairly strong support to Coase’s argument regarding
the pricing constraints facing a durable goods monopolist.


**Summary**



We have formally presented the basic microeconomic analysis of markets characterized by either
perfect competition or perfect monopoly. In both
cases, the goal of any firm is assumed to be
to maximize profit. The necessary condition for



profit maximization is that the firm produce at a
level at which marginal revenue equals marginal
cost. Because firms in competitive markets take
market price as a given, price equals marginal
revenue for the competitive firm. As a result, the


44 Foundations


competitive market equilibrium is one in which
price is set equal to marginal cost. In turn, this
implies that the competitive market equilibrium is
efficient in that it maximizes the sum of producer
and consumer surplus.

The pure monopoly case does not yield an efficient outcome. The monopoly firm understands
that it can affect the market price and this implies
that marginal revenue will be less than the price
for a monopoly firm. If the market demand curve
is linear, this difference is reflected in the fact
that the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve has
the same price intercept but is twice as steeply
sloped as its demand curve. A monopoly firm
equating marginal revenue with marginal cost,
as required for profit maximization, yields an
output inefficiently below that of the competitive
equilibrium. Resources are misallocated because
too few resources are employed in the production
of the monopolized commodity. The inefficiency
that results is often called the deadweight or
welfare loss of monopoly.

There are, however, some natural limits to
monopoly power. To begin with, monopoly profits will attract entry so that firms with substantial
market shares may be forced to price relatively
close to competitive levels by potential entrants
who will swoop in and steal customers away

(perhaps permanently) should the incumbent firm
materially abuse its market power. In addition,
monopolists of durable goods face competition
from still-surviving units of their own earlier production. This creates a difficult pricing tension
that can again discipline the firm’s pricing and,
depending on the distribution of consumer reservation prices, even force it to charge perfectly
competitive prices. To be sure, this discipline
requires that consumers are forward-looking and
that they consider future used good prices when
they make their initial purchase. Evidence from
the market for student textbooks tends to confirm
that this is the case.

Perfect competition and monopoly form the
two polar cases of market structure. The behavior of firms and the nature of market outcomes in
these two cases are fairly well understood. The
remaining question is what happens in the far
more common cases of something between these
two extremes. Before we directly address that
issue, however, we need to have a more rigorous
way of characterizing the market setting and a
deeper understanding of the technological and
cost features that give rise to particular market
structures. These are the topics to be addressed
in the next two chapters.

## **The Calculus of Competition**


The competitive firm’s problem may be solved by first writing the firm’s profit _π_ as a
function of its output, _π(_ q _)_ in turn defined as revenue R _(q)_ less cost C _(q)_ . Price-taking
behavior implies R _(q)_ = _Pq_ . Hence:

_π(q)_ = R _(q)_  - _C(q)_ = _Pq_  - C _(q)_ (2.A1)

Standard maximization then yields:


_dπ_

(2.A2)
_dq_

[=] _[ P]_ [ −] _[C]_ [′] _[(q)]_ [ =][ 0]

_P_ = marginal cost _C_ [′] _(q)_ under perfect competition.

For the monopoly firm, its output is the same as industry output _Q_, that gives _P(Q)_,
via the inverse demand curve. Hence, the monopolist’s profit maximization problem is to
choose output _Q_ so as to maximize:


_π(Q)_ = R _(Q)_  - C _(Q)_ = _P(Q)Q_  - C _(Q)_ (2.A3)

Again, standard maximization techniques yield:

(2.A4)
_dQ_

[=][ P] _[(Q)]_ [ +] _[ QP]_ [′] _[(Q)]_ [ −] [C][′] _[(Q)]_ [ =][ 0]

_P(Q)_ + _Q_ P [′] _(Q)_, is the firm’s marginal revenue. The monopolist will maximize profit by
producing where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. For a linear demand curve of the
form of _P(Q)_ = A − B _Q_ we have P [′] _(Q)_ = −B. In this case, the firm’s marginal revenue
is A − B _Q_ - B _Q_, or A − 2 _B_ Q. The monopolist’s marginal revenue curve has the same
intercept as its demand curve twice the slope.

Note that the profit-maximizing condition above can also be written as


_P(Q)_  - _C_ [′] _(Q)_ = − _QP_ [′] _(Q)_ (2.A5)

# **3** **Market Structure and Market Power**

Early industrial economics, working in the Structure-Conduct-Performance framework,
examined firms’ decisions given the industrial structure. More modern analysis, however,
recognizes that firms’ strategic behavior will in fact be a major determinant of market
structure. Yet despite this change in perspective, it is clear that contemporary industrial
economics must still address the issue of market structure, or the way the industry’s
producers are organized. In turn, this requires that market structure—and its close cousin
market power—be well understood in a way that allows distinction between different
structures or different degrees of market power.

We know, for example, that markets work well when the market consists of numerous
firms, each with a minimal market share. Yet such markets are relatively rare in the real
world. Some markets have just two or three firms. Some have ten or twelve of unequal size.
In what ways is this difference important? If there are twenty firms, does it matter if one
firm has 60 percent of the market and the other nineteen have just a bit more than 2 percent
each? Alternatively, can we measure market structure in such a way that enables us to make
some inference of market power? Can we create an index that allows us to say how close
or how far a market structure is from the competitive ideal? Because such a roadmap could
be of great use to policy makers, it is worthwhile to explore the question at some length.


3.1 DESCRIBING MARKET STRUCTURE


One way to think about an industry’s structure is to undertake the following simple
procedure. First, take all the firms in the industry and rank them by some measure of size
from largest to smallest—one, denoting largest; two, the next largest; etc. Suppose for
example that we use production as a measure of size. We could then calculate the fraction of
the industry’s total output that is accounted for by the largest firm, then the two largest firms
combined, then the three largest firms combined, and so on. This gives us the cumulative
fraction of the industry’s total output as we include progressively smaller firms. Plotting
this relationship yields what we call a concentration curve. It is called a concentration curve
because it describes the extent to which output is concentrated in the hands of just a few
firms.

**Figure 3.1** Some possible concentration curves


Figure 3.1 displays concentration curves for each of three representative industries: A,
B, and C. The firms’ ranked sizes are measured along the horizontal axis, again with the
first firm being the largest. The cumulative market share is measured on the vertical axis.
For example, Industry A has ten firms, each with a 10 percent market share. Industry B
has twenty-one firms, the largest of which has a 55 percent market share. The remaining
twenty firms each have a 2.25 percent share. Finally, in Industry C, there are three firms
each with a market share of 25 percent and five firms each with a market share of 5 percent.
For Industry B, the vertical coordinates corresponding to the horizontal values 1 and 2
on the concentration curve are 55 and 57.25, respectively. This reflects the fact that the
largest firm has 55 percent of the market and the largest two firms have 57.25 percent
between them.

Concentration curves are a useful illustrative device. [1] They permit one to get a quick
sense of how industry production is allocated across firms from a swift visual inspection.
However, often we need to summarize industrial structure with just a single parameter or
index. One such measure that is frequently used is the four-firm concentration ratio, CR4, or
the percent of industry sales accounted for by the top four firms. For the three hypothetical
industries described above, we can identify the CR4 concentration very easily. All we
need to do is draw a vertical line from the value 4 on the horizontal axis to the relevant
concentration curve, and from that point read horizontally to the vertical axis coordinate.
As can be seen, CR4 is 40, 61.75, and 80, for A, B, and C, respectively. A similar exercise
yields the eight-firm ratio CR8 that also is often reported. Its value for markets A, B, and C
is 80, 70.75, and 100, respectively.

Thus, for any _n_, we can define CR _n_ as the _n_ -firm concentration ratio. A little thought will
then quickly reveal that CR _n_ corresponds to a particular point on the industry’s concentration
curve. It follows that the principal drawback to such a measure is that it omits the other
information in the curve. Compare for example the four-firm and eight-firm concentration


1 Those familiar with the GINI Coefficient typically used to measure income inequality will recognize the
concentration curve as the industrial structure analog of the Lorenz Curve from which the GINI Coefficient
is derived. For further details, see Damgaard (2007).

ratios just given for the A, B, and C industries. Industry A appears more concentrated than
does industry B using the CR8 measure, but less concentrated when evaluated with the
CR4 index.

An alternative to CR _n_ that attempts to reflect more fully the information in the concentration curve is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index or, more simply, the HI. For an industry
with _N_ firms, this is defined as follows:



HI =




- _N_


_i_ =1



_si_ [2] (3.1)



where _si_ is the market share of the _i_ th firm. In other words, the HI is the sum of the squares
of the market shares of all of the firms in the industry. Table 3.1 illustrates the calculation
of the HI for industry C in our example. If we measure market share in decimal terms so
that a firm with 25 percent of the market has a share _si_ 0.25, the HI for industry C is
0.20. Compare this to a maximum value of HI = 1.0, which would be the HI if the industry =
were a pure monopoly with one firm accounting for all the output. However, the practice is
often to measure the shares in percentage terms in which case the HI for industry C is 2000,
which compares with a maximum, pure monopoly value of HI = 10,000 when shares are
measured in this way. For industries A and B, similar calculations yield HI = 1,000 and
HI = 3,126.25, respectively.

Like a concentration ratio, the HI measure has its drawbacks. However, it does have one
very strong advantage over a measure such as CR4 or CR8. This is that the HI reflects the
combined influence of both unequal firm sizes and the concentration of activity in a few
large firms. That is, rather than just reflect a single point on the concentration curve, the
HI provides, in a single number, a more complete sense of the shape of that curve. It is
this ability to reflect both average firm size and inequality of size between firms that leads
economists to prefer the HI to simple concentration ratios such as CR4. In our example,
Industry B gets the highest HI value because it is the one with the greatest disparity in firm
sizes.

market share of 49 percent. The next three firms have market shares of 7 percent each, and
the remaining six firms have equal shares of 5 percent each. In industry B, the top four firms
share the bulk of the market with 19 percent apiece. The next largest firm accounts for 14
percent, and the smallest five firms equally split the remaining 10 percent of the industry.

competitive structure? Which measure do you think gives a better indication of this?
Explain.

3.1.1 Measurement Matters: What Is a Market?

Whether one uses CR4 or HI as an overall measure of a market’s structure, it should be clear
that the ability to make such measurements at all is predicated upon our ability to identify
a well-defined market in the first place. In truth, this is not often easy to do. Consider, for
example, the soft drink Pepsi. Does Pepsi compete only against other carbonated beverages,
or should we also include such products as fruit juices, iced teas, and flavored milk in
thinking about this market? Alternatively, think about multi-use products such as the _Xbox_
that, among other capabilities, can function as a DVR and a platform for streaming services
such as Netflix and HBO GO. Is the relevant market for _Xbox_ simply that of video games, or
does it also include products such as TiVo? Unless we have a clear procedure for answering
such questions, any summary measure of market structure such as HI will become an
arbitrary statistic capable of being manipulated either upward or downward at the whim of
the researcher. An analyst can then make CR4 or HI arbitrarily small or large by defining
the market either broadly or narrowly.

One commonly used set of market definitions is the set maintained by the US Census
Bureau (in collaboration with other agencies) known as the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS). The Bureau begins by first categorizing the output of
business units in the United States into broad sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing,
primary metals, agriculture, and forestry products, each of which receives a numeric code.
These sectors are then subdivided further, and each is given a two-digit code. The
manufacturing sector, for example, is covered by codes 31–33, while retail is covered by
codes 44–45, and finance by 52. In each case, the two-digit codes are further disaggregated
into the three-digit, four-digit, five-digit, and six-digit levels. Each additional digit represents
a further subdivision of the initial classification. The Bureau surveys companies and assigns
each plant to a specific six-digit industry, defined primarily on the basis of similarity of
production processes. For plants that produce more than one product, the Bureau makes
an assignment based on the plant’s primary product, as measured by sales. Once all the
establishments are so assigned at the most disaggregated level, it is easy to add up to the
higher levels. It is also straightforward to work out the market shares and concentration
indices according to who owns which plants for any industry at any level of aggregation.

These data are published regularly by the Census Bureau. Table 3.2 shows both CR4 and
HI for a sample of well-known NAICS industries. [2]

The two measures of industrial concentration, CR4 and HI, are highly correlated, implying
that each gives roughly the same description of an industry’s structure. Yet while the CR4
and HI measures often tell the same story, the crucial question is whether or not it is the
right story. [3] As a little consideration quickly confirms, there is in fact reason to doubt that
this is the case.

The source of the potential dissatisfaction with NAICS-based measures of industry
structure is that these measures are based more on commonality of production technologies
and less on whether the output of the different establishments considered really do compete
with each other. Generally speaking, we would like to include production establishments
in the same market if the goods that they produce are close substitutes in consumption. Yet
as noted, the NAICS procedure is based more on a similarity of production techniques. For
example, while wood flooring, resilient floor covering (e.g., linoleum tile), and ceramic tile
are all flooring products, the NAICS categorization places them in different industries at the
three-digit and all higher levels (321 for wood flooring, 326 for resilient flooring, and 327
for ceramic tile). In addition, the industries identified by the NAICS data calculate market
shares on the basis of the national market when in fact practical considerations for a number

of goods, such as newspapers and ready-mix concrete, imply that inter-firm competition is
only local or regional while for others such as passenger aircraft or automobile manufacture
competition in international.

If true product markets are defined by the substitutability between the various goods sold,
then one would ideally like to define such substitutes on the basis of a direct measure of
such substitutability. A formal measure that captures this relationship is what economists
call the cross-price elasticity of demand _ηij_ . This is defined as the percentage change in
demand for good _i_ that occurs when there is a 1 percent change in the price of another good
_j_ . The mathematical definition of this elasticity is



_ηij_ _[�q][i]_
= _�pj_



_pj_

_qi_



(3.2)



In brief, if _ηij_ is large and positive then goods _i_ and _j_ would be considered to be reasonably
close substitutes. [4] Precisely what values of _ηij_ ought to be considered large and positive,
though, is not immediately clear.

A practical approach to market definition that implicitly embodies the cross-elasticity
measure is that employed by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
in evaluating mergers. [5] This is typically referred to as the SSNIP standard. This is an
acronym for a “small but significant and non-transitory increase in price.” Essentially,
the authorities start with the narrowest possible definition of the market. For example,
they might consider grocery stores selling natural, organic products such as Whole Foods.
In that case, the SSNIP test would be whether, if all such natural foods grocery stores
were monopolized, the monopolist could profitably raise the price of any of the goods
by some small amount—usually 5 percent. If the answer is yes, then these grocery stores
by themselves constitute a relevant product market. The intuition is that the hypothetical
monopolist could only profitably raise prices if other stores left out of this market did not
offer close substitutes and therefore the market analyzed is well-defined. If the answer to the
SSNIP test is no, however, then the potential market is widened perhaps to all grocery stores
natural or not, and the test of a profitable price increase by a hypothetical monopolist is
repeated. If the answer is still no, then this process continues through ever wider definitions
of the retail food market until the “yes” moment is realized.

While the SSNIP standard is clear however, its implementation is not. For example,
in the early 2000s, Oracle, People-Soft, and SAP were the three leading firms engaged
in developing, manufacturing, marketing, and servicing the complicated software used by
businesses to manage their large organizations. This software is often further subdivided
into separate modules for a corporation’s many parts. Thus, there is a software module for
human resources management (HRM), for financial management (FM), for supply chain
management (SCM), and customer relations management (CRM). Besides the three firms
already mentioned, there were also many smaller firms specializing in just one of these
modules. The DOJ filed suit to block the proposed merger of Oracle and People-Soft. In its
suit, the Justice Department argued that the relevant market based on an SSNIP test was the


4 However, a high monopoly price may inflate the cross-elasticity measure, a point originally emphasized
by Stocking and Mueller (1955). Because the marginal consumer may look for substitutes when faced with
a high monopoly price that would not be sought if the good were priced competitively, the cross price
elasticity measured at the current industry price may be unduly large.
5 Since 1997, the European Commission has also explicitly recognized this standard as a tool for market
definition.


54 Foundations


market for high-end business software of the type sold to large and complex firms including
major universities such as Stanford and Princeton, major banks such as Bank of America,
and large government agencies such as the Department of Defense. The DOJ argued that
competition to provide such complex firms with business software took place in auction
markets in which only the three largest vendors could participate because each firm required
a very detailed and uniquely configured software plan. The many smaller firms did not, and
could not compete for these contracts because they focused on selling and servicing simple,
standardized products that, while appropriate for much smaller firms, could never serve the
needs of the large complex enterprises. The DOJ argued that an SSNIP test confirmed this
market definition. However, Oracle disagreed and argued that a proper application of the
SSNIP standard would indicate that a much broader market definition including all those
firms preparing business software was appropriate. [6] Thus, while the standard may be clear,
the proper way to impose it is more ambiguous.


3.1.2 More Measurement Matters: Geography and Vertical Relations


The application of the SSNIP standard above depended on what products define the market.
Which products are included in the market and which are not? Clearly however, there is an
equal need to define the market’s geographic space. Consider for example the newspapers
that serve the same city. Assuming that printed news media is determined to be a relevant
product market, we still need to determine which printed media constitute the citywide
newspaper market. Is it just newspapers printed and sold within the city? Or do national
newspapers that are printed far beyond the city such as the _New York Times_ and _USA Today_
also constitute some of the market?

Alternatively, consider a region with a number of software producers who sell to a
global market. If most of these firms’ customers live outside the region then the geographic
boundaries must be expanded. Similarly, it could be the case that local producers sell to
a broad regional or even global market. As a result, although most local consumers buy
from local producers, the presence of many consumers outside the local area means that the
relevant geographic market extends beyond the local region.

In principle, an SSNIP test could be used to define the locations that constitute a geographic
market just as it is used to define the goods that determine a specific product market. That
is, once we have defined the relevant product market, we can define a region such as the
local city and ask whether a firm that monopolized production within this area—say of
newspapers or software—could impose small but significant and non-transitory increases
in price. If the answer is yes, then the city does define a relevant geographic market. If the
answer is no, then a wider geographic region needs to be considered.

In fact, the merger guidelines put out by the DOJ and the FTC point to exactly that kind
of test. In practice however, alternative approaches are often used to define the relevant
geographic market. A common test in this regard is the Elzinga-Hogarty (1978) test. This
test considers two features of a geographic region to determine whether it represents a
legitimate regional market. The first is LIFO (Little in from Outside) defined as 1 minus the
fraction of all the products consumed within a region that are produced outside the region.
Returning to our newspaper example, if 20 percent of all newspaper subscriptions within
a local area are national newspapers, then LIFO would be 80 percent. The other measure
of the Elzinga-Hogarty (1978) test is LOFI (Little out from Inside). This is calculated as


6 31 F. Supp. 2d 1098; 2004–2 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶4,542. In the main, the court accepted Oracle’s view and
the merger was allowed to proceed.


Market Structure and Market Power 55


1 minus the fraction of production within the region that is shipped to consumers outside
the region. In other words, LIFO is a rough measure of 1 minus the fraction imported
while LOFI is roughly 1 minus the fraction exported. Based on a review of historical
evidence, Elzinga and Hogarty (1978) suggest that for regions in which either the LIFO
and LOFI measures both exceed 75 percent, or where their average exceeds 90 percent, the
presumption that the region is a well-defined geographic market is strong.

Yet while the Elzinga and Hogarty (1978) standard is easy to understand and measure,
the threshold value needed to establish a definite market is not. As noted, Elzinga and
Hogarty (1978) suggest a 75 _/_ 90 threshold as a practical rule of thumb. Yet this critical
value is based on economic intuition and a rough sense of what is workable—not on any
probability distribution that would allow us to construct confidence intervals or test for
statistical significance. It is not entirely clear, for example, why thresholds of 65 and 80
would not be better at capturing actual market boundaries. Note too that the definition of
the product market has implications for the definition of the geographic market and vice
versa. In the Oracle case, for example, the LIFO and LOFI measures vary depending on
whether the product market consists of just the individualized business software sold by the
big three firms or all business software sold by any firm.

A further issue with both product and market definitions relates to the relationships
between firms operating at different stages of the production process. The delivery of a
final good or service to the customer often represents the last of many steps. These include
the acquisition of the raw materials, their transformation into a semi-finished good, the
refinement of the semi-finished good into a final consumer product, and thereafter, the
retailing. In economics jargon, the initial raw materials phase is typically described as the
upstream phase after which the product flows “downstream” through the various stages
toward its final sale to the consumer. The relationship between upstream and downstream
phases is therefore a vertical one, and there are several forms that this relationship can take.
An upstream producer may own all the subsequent phases in which case we say the firm is
vertically integrated. Alternatively, an upstream producer may offer franchising agreements
or long-term contracts to downstream sellers. The existence and variability of such
relationships can cause difficulty in measuring the structure of the market at any one stage
of production. For instance, there are many bottling companies so that conventional measures
of market concentration in the bottled can and soft drink industry are rather low. In turn, this
suggests a fairly competitive market. However, the reality is that most bottling companies do
not compete with each other but, instead, are tied through strict contractual agreements to use
one of the national upstream suppliers, such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi. [7] As a result, there may
be much less competition among bottlers than the concentration measure would suggest.

In sum, the interpretation of structural market measures such as CR4 and HI is greatly
complicated by a variety of factors beginning with the fact that any such structure
is endogenous. Much of our data collection organizes markets on the basis of similar
production techniques rather than on a measure of substitution. Implementing more
appropriate market measures such as SSNIP requires careful application and interpretation
of the evidence, and this can be problematical. Geographic definitions such as the Elzinga
and Hogarty (1978) standard are easy to understand, but it is not obvious which values
of that standard should serve as a threshold of market determination. The point is that
while much of the theoretical work covered in this text will take the market at hand to be
well understood, the real world measurement of actual markets is fraught with difficulties.


7 Some authors, for example, Gort (1962) and, more recently, Davies and Morris (1995), have tried to obtain
a precise, quantitative measure of the extent of vertical integration.


56 Foundations


At the same time, one should not overstate the case. For example, categorizing industries
on the basis of closeness of shared production techniques does not necessarily indicate
the substitutability necessary for competition. However, it has the advantage that it likely
does group firms with similar production costs. This is important because any analysis that
links an industry’s configuration to the underlying structure of its technology and costs
only makes sense if the production technologies are sufficiently similar that we can make
general, industry-wide statements about a typical firm’s cost structure.


3.2 MEASURING MARKET POWER


Throughout this chapter, we have been thinking about market structure in the quite literal
sense of how the industry’s production of output is allocated across different firms. We have
seen how summary statistics such as the CR4 or HI attempt to describe this configuration
of firms in an industry much as a census taker might use similar statistics to describe the
number and size of families in a geographic region. A large part of the motivation for these
measures is the desire to summarize succinctly just where an industry might lie relative
to the ideal of perfect competition. There is nothing wrong with this structural approach
so long as one clear caveat is kept in mind: that a particular structure does not necessarily
imply a particular outcome.

When we say that an industry is highly concentrated we are saying that the industry
output is dominated by a few firms, in contrast to the configuration that we associate with
the competitive model. Does that necessarily mean then that prices charged in this industry
are above what would prevail in a perfectly competitive market? The answer is not so
straightforward. As we shall see in subsequent chapters, markets with even just two or three
firms may sometimes come quite close to duplicating the competitive or efficient outcome.

The Lerner Index is one way to measure how well a market performs from an efficiency
point of view. The Lerner Index, _LI_, measures how far the outcome is from the competitive
ideal in the following way:

_LI_ _[P]_ [ −] _[MC]_ (3.3)
= _P_



Because the Lerner Index directly reflects the discrepancy between price and marginal cost
it captures much of what we are interested when it comes to the _exercise_ of market power.
For a competitive firm, the Lerner Index is zero because such a firm prices at marginal cost.
For a pure monopolist, on the other hand, the Lerner Index can be shown to be the inverse
of the elasticity of demand—the less elastic the demand the greater the price-marginal cost
distortion. (See the Appendix of Chapter 2 for a formal derivation.) To see this, recall that
for a monopolist the marginal revenue of selling an additional unit of output can be written



as _MR_ _P_ _[�][P]_
= + _�Q_



_�Q_ _[Q]_ [. For profit maximization we set marginal revenue equal to marginal]

where 1 _/η_ is the inverse of the elasticity of demand. The less elastic is demand, or the
smaller is _η_, the greater is the difference between market price and marginal cost of

production in the monopoly outcome. To drive the point home, recall that the perfectly
competitive firm faces an infinitely elastic or horizontal demand curve. When such a large
value is substituted for the elasticity term, equation (3.4) implies a Lerner Index of 0. Again,
the perfectly competitive firm sells at a price equal to marginal cost. Note too that the Lerner
Index can never exceed 1 and that it can only hit this maximum value if marginal cost is 0.

For an industry of more than one but not a large number of firms, measuring the Lerner
Index is more complicated and requires obtaining some average index of marginal cost. A
particularly straightforward case in this regard is that in which the commodity in question
is homogenous so that all firms must sell at exactly the same price. If this is so, then we can
measure a market-wide Lerner Index as:




- _N_



_siMCi_

_i_ =1 (3.5)

_P_



_LI_ =



_P_ 


Here, as before, _si_ is the market share of the _i_ th firm and _N_ is the total number of firms.

The Lerner Index is a very useful conceptual tool and we will make reference to it
throughout the remainder of this book. Like the CR4 or the HI, the Lerner Index is a
summary measure. The difference is that the Lerner Index is not so much a measure of how
an industry’s production is structured as it is a measure of the market outcome. The greater
the Lerner Index, the farther the market outcome lies from the competitive case—and the
more market power is being exploited. In this sense, the Lerner Index is a direct and useful
gauge of the extent of market competition.

For example, Ellison (1994) tries to get evidence on game-theoretic models of cartel
behavior. For this purpose, he studies railroad prices over time in the late nineteenth century.
He estimates that, apart from price war periods, the Lerner Index was about 85 percent of
what it would be under pure monopoly pricing. In other words, the collusive behavior of
railroads at this time was capable of coming within 15 percent of the pure monopoly price
distortion.

However, much like the structural indices, the Lerner Index also has its problems. To
begin with, calculating the Lerner Index for an industry runs into the problem of market
definition. Further, even when the market definition is reasonably clear, the Lerner Index
is still difficult to measure. It is one thing to count the number and estimate the sizes of
the various firms in an industry. Measuring the elasticity of demand is trickier. Measuring
marginal cost is even more difficult. Unfortunately, even small changes in the assumptions
one makes about the data can lead to sizable differences in estimated price–cost margins.
For example, Ellison’s (1994) study relied on data studied earlier by Porter (1983). Yet
Porter’s (1983) estimate of the price distortion during collusive periods is only half as large
as Ellison’s (1994) estimate.

Moreover, even when the Lerner Index is accurately measured its interpretation can
remain ambiguous. Suppose for example that each firm in an industry has to incur a
one-time sunk cost _F_ associated with setting up its establishment. Assume further that each
firm’s marginal cost is constant. Because each firm needs to earn enough operating profit to
cover its sunk cost, the equilibrium price level will need to rise above marginal cost. That
is, the Lerner Index will need to be positive. However, the more positive that difference
is—the greater is the price–cost margin—the greater the number of firms that can cover
the one time sunk cost. As a result, we might observe a high Lerner Index in a setting in
which there are numerous firms, none of which is very large. In such a case, the high Lerner


58 Foundations


Index might erroneously indicate little competition even though no firm has any significant
market power. [8]

Conversely, the Lerner Index might underestimate market power in settings in which
cost-reducing innovations are important. Suppose for example that an industry has an old
and not very efficient incumbent firm with high marginal cost. As long as demand is
somewhat elastic, such a firm may have no choice but to price relatively close to marginal
cost. At the same time, the incumbent has a great incentive to take whatever actions it
can that will keep a low-cost rival from entering the market. In this case, the Lerner
Index deceptively indicates a fair bit of competition because price is low relative to the
incumbent’s marginal cost when the relevant but unavailable comparison is the price with
the potential rival’s lower marginal cost. [9]


3.3 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: MONOPOLY POWER—HOW
BAD IS IT?


A recurrent question in antitrust policy is just how costly imperfect competition is for
the economy overall. If the losses from monopoly power are not large, then devoting
any significant resources to antitrust enforcement to prevent such losses is probably not
worthwhile. Such scarce resources would be better used in, say, increasing homeland
security or providing relief to hurricane victims. If the economic costs of market power are
large, however, then allocating resources to combat the abuse of that power is likely to be
warranted. Hence, it would be useful if economists had some sense of just how serious the
losses from monopoly power actually are.

In principle, economists have a clear measure of the economic loss caused by monopoly
power. It is the deadweight loss or triangle that results from prices above marginal cost.
In practice, however, measuring this loss is not so easy. This is because it requires getting
estimates of cost and/or demand but, as with any estimate, these values are subject to some
error. Unfortunately, rather small changes in the estimates can lead to rather large changes
in the estimated welfare cost.

To understand the issues involved, let us start with the basic measurement of the welfare
or deadweight loss that results from pricing above marginal cost. As shown in Chapter 2,
this is the area whose height is given by the difference between price _P_ and marginal cost
_MC_, and whose base is given by the difference between the competitive output _Q_ _[C]_ that
would sell if _P_ = _MC_ and the actual market output _Q_ that sells at the actual price _P_ . Hence,
the welfare loss _WL_ is:


_WL_ [1] (3.6)
= 2 _[(P]_ [ −] _[MC][)(Q][C]_ [ −] _[Q)]_


It is convenient to express this welfare loss as a proportion of total sales revenue _PQ_
to yield




_[WL]_ [1]

_PQ_ 2

_WL_ [′] _[WL]_

_P_

Market Structure and Market Power 59


Remember that the elasticity of demand _η_ is the proportionate increase in output in
response to a given proportionate decrease in price. If the price were to fall from its current
_P_ level to the competitive level of _P_ = _MC_, then output would rise to the competitive level
of _Q_ _[C]_ . That is:



_η_ _[(Q][C]_ [ −] _[Q)/Q]_
= _(P_ _MC)/P_




_[(Q][C]_ [ −] _[Q)/Q]_ _(Q_ _[C]_ - _Q)_

_(P_ _MC)/P_ ⇒ _Q_
 


_Q)_

- _η_ _[(P]_ [ −] _[MC][)]_

_Q_ = _P_



(3.8)
_P_



Because we also know that the industry Lerner Index is _(P_  - _MC)/P_, we can rewrite
equation (3.7) as:




_[WL]_ [1]

_PQ_ 2

[=]



_WL_ [′] _[WL]_
= _PQ_



(3.9)
2 _[η(][LI][)]_ [2]



Now recall from equation (3.4) earlier in the chapter that, for a pure monopolist, the
Lerner Index is given by: _LI_ = _(P_ - _MC)/P_ = 1 _/η_ . Then, in this case, the deadweight
loss relative to industry sales will be:




_[WL]_ [1]

_PQ_ 2

[=]



_WL_ [′] _[WL]_
= _PQ_

(3.10)
_η_



That is, for the perfect monopoly case, the deadweight loss as a fraction of current
industry sales is simply one-half the Lerner Index or one over twice the elasticity of
demand. The intuition is that as the demand elasticity increases, the welfare loss shrinks
because other goods are increasingly viewed as substitutes to the monopolized commodity.
Note further the sensitivity of the welfare loss to the elasticity estimate. An estimate that
_η_ = 1.5 produces a welfare loss equal to 33 percent of revenue. An estimate of _η_ = 2
reduces this amount to 25 percent of revenue. That is, a 0.5 change in the elasticity estimate
yields an eight percent change in the welfare loss.

The first person to make calculations along the foregoing lines on a large scale was
Arnold Harberger (1954). Using a sample of 73 manufacturing industries, Harberger (1954)
took the difference in the five-year average industry rate of return and the five-year average
for manufacturing overall as an approximation of _LI_ . Because he worked with industry
data, and because none of the industries was a pure monopoly, Harberger (1954) could not
assume that his _LI_ estimate is the inverse of elasticity of demand, as we did in equation
(3.10). Instead, he combined his _LI_ estimates with an assumed demand elasticity of _η_ = 1 in
equation (3.9). The dollar value of these estimated distortions is then given by multiplying
_WL_ [′] by industry sales _PQ_ . When Harberger (1954) added these dollar values up and
extrapolated the results across the entire economy he found a surprisingly small welfare
cost of monopoly—on the order of one-tenth of one percent of Gross Domestic Product.
The low value of Harberger’s (1954) estimate thus raised a serious question about the
cost-effectiveness of antitrust policy and litigation.

Harberger’s (1954) approach, however, did not go uncriticized. Bergson (1973) noted that
Harberger’s (1954) procedure essentially used a partial equilibrium framework to obtain
a general equilibrium measure. He demonstrated that, in principle, this could mean that
Harberger’s (1954) estimate considerably understated the actual loss. Cowling and Mueller
(1978) used firm-level data for 734 companies in the United States and 103 companies in the
United Kingdom. The use of firm-level data means that Cowling and Mueller (1978) could
apply equation (3.10) directly. Their estimated monopoly welfare costs range from 4 to 13
percent of GDP in the United States and from 4 to 7 percent in the United Kingdom—far
larger than Harberger’s (1954) estimates.

Robert Hall (1988) used a production theory approach to derive estimates of the Lerner
Index for twenty broad manufacturing sectors in the United States. These are shown in
Table 3.3. Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) obtained similar but generally lower
estimates of the Index using Hall’s (1988) approach corrected for changes in raw material
usage. Whereas Hall (1988) found an average price–cost margin of 0.577, Domowitz,
Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) estimate the average to be only 0.37. Even this lower value,
however, indicates a substantial degree of welfare loss in the manufacturing sector due to
non-competitive pricing.

An important source of variation in Cowling and Mueller’s (1978) analysis is how
advertising costs are treated in measuring _LI_ . This calls attention to the critical importance
of the marginal cost measure in determining welfare losses. This issue has been addressed
more recently by Aiginger and Pfaffermayr (1997). They start by recognizing that without
the pressure of perfect competition, firms can operate in an industry with different cost
efficiencies. Thus, the average industry marginal cost ~~_MC_~~ is very likely not the minimum
average cost that would be enforced if perfect competition were the rule. Aiginger and
Pfaffermayr (1997) then make use of a result (one that we shall derive in Chapter 9) from a
standard oligopoly model. The result is that the industry price-cost margin measure using
~~_MC_~~ is equal to the industry Herfindahl Index _HI_ (scaled from 0 to 1), divided by the
elasticity of industry demand. That is:



~~_MC_~~ _[HI]_

_P_ = _η_







_P_ - ~~_MC_~~



_η_ _HI_
_η_ ⇒ =

_P_ - ~~_MC_~~

Note that the term




_P_ - _MC_



_P_ - _MC_



is greater than one because _MC_ is the marginal cost



that would prevail under competition. Aiginger and Pfaffermayr (1997) measure this
competitive _MC_ as the marginal cost of the most efficient firm in the industry under the
assumption that this is the cost efficiency that would be required for competitive firms to
survive. Effectively, their approach permits them to decompose the welfare cost of market
power into two parts. One is the traditional welfare loss measure due to prices not equal to
_industry_ average marginal cost, _P_ - ~~_MC_~~ . The other is due to the fact that market power
allows the survival of firms with higher than minimum costs, ~~_MC_~~ - _MC_ . Using data from
10,000 cement and paper firms in the European Union, Aiginger and Pfaffermayr (1997)
find that the total welfare loss of market power in these industries is on the order of 9 to
11 percent of industry sales. Perhaps not surprisingly, they find that these welfare losses
are largely due to the cost inefficiencies that imperfect competition permits. Thus, their
estimate of the traditional welfare loss measure is on the order of 2 to 3 percent, while the
cost inefficiency loss is on the order of 7 to 7.5 percent. Extrapolating these estimates to the
entire economy would yield results that are considerably closer to the Cowling and Mueller
estimates (1978) than those obtained by Harberger (1954).

In evaluating all of these estimates, it is useful to bear in mind at least two caveats. First, an
implicit assumption in all these calculations is that it is feasible to have perfect competition
in all industries. As we shall see in the next chapter, however, costs and technology make
this an unlikely outcome. In this sense, the estimates of welfare losses due to monopoly
price distortions are too high as there is no way in which all industries could be freed of
such market power. Second, the measures are taken from data in which active antitrust
enforcement has been the norm. In this sense, the measures are an understatement of the
potential for monopoly-induced welfare losses. Had there been no antitrust enforcement,
there would have presumably been more market power abuses and the associated welfare
losses would have been greater.


**Summary**



This chapter has focused on the measurement
of market structure and market power. We are
very often interested in summarizing the extent to
which an industry departs from the competitive
ideal in a single number or index. The issue then
becomes whether and how we can construct such
a summary measure.

Concentration indices, such as the CR4 or HI,
are explicit measures of a market’s structure.
Both look at firm shares as a fraction of the
industry’s total output. Both encounter important problems, such as the difficulty of accurately
defining the relevant market. The HI, however,
is generally preferred by economists since it not



only reflects the top firm shares but also the
differences in relative firm sizes.

An explicit measure of market power is the
Lerner Index. Because it is based on a comparison of price and marginal cost, this index directly
addresses the extent to which the market outcome
deviates from the competitive ideal. However, the
need to measure marginal cost accurately, along
with other measurement issues, makes the Lerner
Index as difficult to employ as the structural
indices. Estimates of the Lerner Index also serve
as a useful starting point to estimate the actual
efficiency costs of monopoly power. Many efforts
have been made to do this for the entire economy


62 Foundations


in an attempt to get a general view as to how serious the problem of market power really is. These
empirical studies have yielded a wide range of
estimates of the aggregate deadweight loss as a
percentage of GDP. The lower bound estimate
is that monopoly power imposes only a small
inefficiency cost of a few tenths of one percent of
GDP. However, upper bound estimates range as
high as 14 percent. A crucial parameter in such
studies is the elasticity of demand assumed to be
typical.


**Problems**



As long as the foregoing problems are recognized, the CR4, HI, and Lerner Index measures are useful starting points to characterize
an industry’s competitive position. However, an
industry’s degree of concentration and price–cost
margin do not materialize out of thin air. Instead,
these indices all derive from the interaction of
a number of factors. One of those factors is the
nature of production costs. The role that technology and cost play in shaping the industrial
outcome is examined in the next chapter.

2. Consider a market comprised of three firms. Firm 1 produces and sells 23 units per period. Firm
produces and sells 19 units per period, while firm 3’s periodic production and sales are 15 units.
The (inverse) market demand is estimated to be: _P_ = 100 − _Q_, where _Q_ = total output =
_q_ 1 _q_ 2 _q_ 3. Determine the market price and the elasticity of market demand as well as the
market share of each firm. Now use equation (3.5) to determine each firm’s marginal cost. What + +
relation do you find between marginal cost and market share?


3. Monopoly Air is on record with the local transportation authority arguing that there is no market
need and no market room for an additional air service because even now, Monopoly Air planes
are flying with only 60 percent of the seats typically booked. Hence, it argues that the market is
not large enough to sustain two efficient-sized air carriers.

Evaluate this argument. Why might Monopoly Air flights be so under-booked? Does this
prove that there is no “market room” for a new competitor?

4. We defined the Lerner Index as _LI_ = 1 _/µ_ where _µ_ is the absolute value of the elasticity of
demand. We also showed that _LI_ can be alternatively expressed as _(P_   - _MC)/P_ . Use these
relationships to show that _LI_ can never exceed 1. What does this imply is the minimum demand
elasticity we should ever observe for a monopolist?
