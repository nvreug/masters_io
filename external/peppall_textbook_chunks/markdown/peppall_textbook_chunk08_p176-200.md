It is easy to check that the incentive compatibility constraint is always satisfied for type 2
consumers. For this type of consumer _not_ to want to buy the high-quality product it must be

Given that _z_ 1 _> z_ 2 and _θ p_ 11 _> θ_ ≤ _θ_ 21 this must be true. In other words, the prices _z_ 1 − _(θ_ 1 − _θ_ 2 _)z_ 2 this implies– _(θ_ 1 − _θ_ 2 _)z_ 1 +
and type 2 consumers buy the low-quality product.

Now assume that there are _Ni_ consumers of each type. Furthermore, suppose that variable
costs of production do not depend on quality and so for simplicity we set the unit production
costs of each good _c_ 1 _c_ 2 0. Again for simplicity assume that there are no fixed costs
as well. Given that _p_ 1 = = _θ_ 1 = _z_ 1 − _(θ_ 1 − _θ_ 2 _)z_ 2 and _p_ 2 = _θ_ 2 _z_ 2 the firm’s total profit is:

_�_ _N_ 1 _p_ 1 _N_ 2 _p_ 2 _N_ 1 _θ_ 1 _z_ 1 _N_ 1 _(θ_ 1 _θ_ 2 _)z_ 2 _N_ 2 _θ_ 2 _z_ 2

=       -       - +

The issue that we want to address now is what quality of goods, _z_ 1 and _z_ 2, will maximize
the firm’s profit. It is clear from equation (7.34) that the coefficient on _z_ 1 is positive, given
by _N_ 1 _θ_ 1. That is, profit rises as _z_ 1 rises, so the firm should set _z_ 1 as high as possible;
that is:


_z_ 1 [∗] ~~_[z]_~~ (7.35)

[=]

The firm should set the quality of its highest quality product at the maximum quality level
possible.

For _z_ 2 matters are not quite as straightforward. The impact of _z_ 2 upon the monopolist’s
profit depends upon the sign of the coefficient, _N_ 1 _θ_ 1 _(N_ 1 _N_ 2 _)θ_ 2. When this term is
positive, the monopolist’s profit decreases as _z_ 2 increases. When it is negative, profit − +
increases as _z_ 2 increases. We need to examine these two cases separately.

_Case_ 1 _: N_ 1 _θ_ 1 _< (N_ 1 + _N_ 2 _)θ_ 2

the firm should setIf _N_ 1 _θ_ 1 _< (N_ 1 + _N z_ 22 _)θ_ 2 then it follows from (7.34) that profit is increasing in _z_ 1 ~~_z_~~ . In other words, the firm should offer only one product and _z_ 2. In this case
that product should be of the highest possible quality. The question now becomes whether = =
the firm in this case should price the high-quality product to sell to both types of consumer
or price it to sell only to type 1 consumers.

Selling to both types of consumer requires that the product be priced at _p_ [∗] _θ_ 2 ~~_z_~~ ~~.~~ Type

2 consumers have all their consumer surplus extracted but, given Assumption 1, type 1
consumers enjoy some consumer surplus. The firm earns a total profit of _(N_ 1 _N_ 2 _)θ_ 2 ~~_z_~~ ~~.~~
If, instead, the monopolist chooses to sell only to type 1 consumers, the product can be +
priced at _p_ _θ_ 1 ~~_(z_~~ _z_ ~~1~~ _)_, extracting all consumer surplus from each type 1 consumer by

                      Comparing these two strategies tells us that that selling to both types of consumers is more
profitable if:



_N_ 1 _θ_ 1 ~~_(z_~~ _z_ ~~1~~ _) < (N_ 1 _N_ 2 _)θ_ 2 ~~_z_~~ _N_ 1 _θ_ 1 _< (N_ 1 _N_ 2 _)θ_ 2

From (7.34) it is clear that in this case profit is decreasing in _z_ 2 and so the firm has

It is here that we see the impact of the assumption that the monopolist cannot distinguish
the two consumer types. The monopolist would like to set _z_ 2 even lower than is implied
by equation (7.37) but cannot do so if the monopolist is to offer products that make the
consumers self-select into their true types.



We can now work out the profit-maximizing prices for the two goods. Substituting

(7.38)



In comparing the prices that the monopolist sets in the two cases, we can identify the
intuition behind the result that in one case the monopolist wants to offer only one (high-)
quality good while in the other the firms wants to offer both a high-quality and a low-quality
good.

We saw that when only one, high-quality good is offered it is priced at _p_ [∗] _θ_ 2 ~~_z_~~ in

7.6 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: PRODUCT QUALITY
AND MARKET SIZE


One important insight that comes from formal consideration of vertically differentiated
markets is that quality tends to increase as the market size grows. The intuition behind this
insight is most easily seen in our initial discussion of a vertical quality market in which the
inverse demand curve is of the general form:


_P_ = _z(K_  - _Q)_ (7.39)

The advantage of this specification is that the market size is totally captured by the parameter
_K_ . Thus, if _K_ = 50, as in our earlier example, the maximum market demand at _P_ = $0
is _Q_ = 50. However, if _K_ = 100, the maximum demand at _P_ = $0 is _Q_ = 100. We can
repeat this comparison at all other prices and the same relative result will emerge. Holding
quality _z_ constant, total demand in the market at any price _P_ is greater the larger is _K_ .

Consider now our earlier example in which the marginal production cost was independent
of quality _z_ and for convenience set to zero, while the overhead design cost was quadratic,
that is, _F(z)_ = 5 _z_ [2] . As before, we can solve for the optimal quantity by recognizing that
marginal revenue is given by: _MR_ = _zK_ - 2 _zQ_ . Equating this to the assumed marginal cost
value of zero, yields:





_Q_ _[K]_
= 2



2 2

[⇒] _[P]_ [ =] _[ z]_ _[K]_



(7.40)
2



In turn, this means that the firm’s profit is given by:



_π(z)_ = _[K]_ 4 [2] _[z]_ [ −] [5] _[z]_ [2] (7.41)


Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly 167


Thus, every increment in quality _z_ raises revenue by _K_ [2] _/_ 4, and we know from before, that
every such increase in quality has a marginal cost of 10 _z_ . Equating this marginal revenue
and marginal cost then yields

_z_ _[K]_ [2] (7.42)
= 40

Again, it is easy to check that when _K_ = 50, this yields _z_ = 62.5 as we found in our initial
example. More generally though, note that the profit-maximizing choice of _z_ increases with
our measure of market size, _K_ .

The foregoing intuition is quite general. It also applies when the marginal production
cost rises with quality. In fact, it holds when there is competition so that different firms
offer different quality products though here it typically means that it is the quality of the
best product that will rise with market size.

In short, there is a general prediction that larger markets ought to offer better quality
products. It is this prediction that Berry and Waldfogel (2010) test in a recent paper. For
this purpose they look at two sets of local markets—those for newspapers and those for
restaurants—where each local market corresponds to one of 283 metropolitan statistical
areas defined by the US Census Bureau. We focus on their newspaper results here because
this market is closest in spirit to the intuitive argument above.

Berry and Waldfogel (2010) define newspaper quality in a number of ways. Because
more content should mean better quality, one measure is simply the number of pages the
newspaper has. For a collection of different newspapers, we might instead take the average
number of pages (AVEPAGE) or, in line with our analysis above, the number of pages in
the largest newspaper (MAXPAGE). An alternative, input-based measure of quality is the
number of reporters on staff, again averaged across all papers (AVESTAFF) or taken at its
largest value for a given community (MAXSTAFF). The number of staff reporters may be
particularly important at the local level, as it is likely to reflect the extent to which the paper
covers local news as opposed to printing syndicated, national reports. [11]

The various measures of newspaper quality are then regressed on a measure of the
metropolitan area population, as a measure of market size, along with other variables
meant to control for various factors that may influence the quality choice—the metropolitan
median income; the percent of the population with some college education; the percent
that are young (under age thirty-five); and the percent that are old (over age sixty-five).
The Berry and Waldfogel (2010) results are shown in Table 7.1 below for regressions that
use the natural logarithm of the quality and market size variables so that the estimated
coefficients are naturally treated as elasticities, i.e., as a ratio of percentage changes.

The estimates across the first row strongly confirm the hypothesis that product quality
rises with market size. Thus, as the population grows by 10 percent, the number of pages
in the average and largest metropolitan area grows by 2 and 3 percent, respectively, and
each result is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Similarly, as the metropolitan
population grows by 10 percent, the number of staff reporters on the average and largest
newspaper grows by 48 and 56 percent, respectively. Again, these results are very
statistically significant.

Moreover, the highest quality paper is also the one with the largest market share. For
example, New York’s paper with the most pages is the _New York Times_ and its metropolitan
market share is essentially the same as the shares of the next two largest papers—the _Daily_

_News_ and the _Post_ —combined. Thus, the highest quality choice is invariably the decision
of the firm with the most market share, which is a bit more in the spirit of the analysis
in this chapter. [12] Overall then, the newspaper quality and market size seem to be very
positively correlated.


**Summary**



This chapter has investigated product-differentiated strategies that a monopolist may employ
when it sells to consumers with diverse tastes.
By offering a line of products, the firm can better
expropriate consumer surplus and increase profit.
First we considered horizontal product differentiation. In this scenario, consumers differ in their
preferences for specific product characteristics.
Some prefer yellow, some black, some soft, some
hard, some sweet, and some sour. By selling different varieties of the product, the monopolist
expands its market and simultaneously enhances
its ability to charge customers higher prices in
return for selling a variety of product that is close
to their most preferred flavor, color, or design.

A feature of this kind of market is that the
monopolist tends to offer too much variety—a
prediction for which there is a good bit of supportive casual evidence. However, the monopolist’s
incentive to over-supply variety is mitigated if the
firm is able to price discriminate. Indeed, perfect



or first-degree price discrimination encourages
the firm to offer consumers the same amount of
variety as the socially optimal case.

We also investigated the monopolist’s strategy
when products are vertically differentiated. In this
case, all consumers agree that higher quality is
better, where quality is measured by some observable feature, or set of features of the product.
Consumers, however, differ in their willingness
to pay for quality. In the case in which the monopolist offers only one type of product and quality is
costly, we found that the monopolist may choose
too low a quality. The monopolist may also have
in the vertically differentiated case an incentive
to offer a range of different qualities in order to
exploit the differences in consumers’ preferences.
In doing so, however, the firm faces an incentive compatibility constraint and must choose
quality and price such that the different types
of consumer will purchase the quality targeted
to their type. These constraints encountered in



12 However, recall our warning from Chapter 1 that structure (and market shares) are endogenous. The high
quality of a paper is as much responsible for that paper’s market share as the firm’s market power is
responsible for the paper’s high quality.

second-degree price discrimination in Chapter 6.
One empirical prediction that emerges from this
analysis is that in vertically differentiated products, the quality of the best product will tend to
rise as the market size increases to allow a fuller
exploitation of any scale economies in making a
better product. Evidence from urban newspaper
markets where quality is measured in terms of
variables such as average staff size or average
number of pages confirms this hypothesis.

We have cast our theoretical discussion mainly
in the context of monopoly. Yet the practices we have described are often employed by
companies that are far from perfect monopolists


**Problems**


1. A monopolist faces the following inverse
demand curve: _P_ = _(_ 36 − 2 _Q)z_ ; where P
is price; Q is her total output; and **z** is
the quality of product sold. **z** can take on
only one of two values. The monopolist can
choose to market a low-quality product for
which _z_ = 1. Alternatively, the monopolist
can choose to market a high-quality product
for which _z_ = 2. Marginal cost is independent of quality and is constant at zero. Fixed
cost, however, depends on the product design
and increases with the quality chosen. Specifically, fixed cost is equal to 65 _z_ [2] .


a. Find the monopolist’s profits if profits

b. Find the monopolist’s profits if profits

is chosen
c. Comparing your answers to 1(a) and
1(b), what quality choice should the
monopolist make?


2. In the early 1970s, the six largest manufacturers of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals shared
95 percent of the market. Over the preceding twenty years, these same manufacturers
introduced over eighty new varieties of cereals. How would you evaluate this strategy
from the viewpoint of the Hotelling spatial
model described earlier in the chapter?

without significant rivals. This reflects the fact
that imperfectly competitive firms often have a
very powerful incentive to offer a range of differentiated products, whether they are horizontally
or vertically differentiated. Indeed, imperfectly
competitive firms often have a very strong incentive to pursue such differentiation as an important
tactic to deal with rivals. We will discuss this
point in subsequent chapters. Here we simply
note that the empirical study of urban newspaper markets reported in this chapter also tends
to confirm this view. Two papers in the same
city rarely offer readers the same quality of news
coverage.


CC estimates that on an average day there
are 1,000 sunbathers evenly spread along the
beach and that each sunbather will buy one
crepe per day provided that the price plus
any disutility cost does not exceed $5. Each
sunbather incurs a disutility cost of getting
up from resting to get a crepe and returning
to their beach spot of 25 cents for every

1 _/_ 4 mile the sunbather has to walk to get to
the CC stall. Each crepe costs $0.50 to make
and CC incurs a $40 overhead cost per day to
operate a stall. How many franchises should
CC award given that it determines the prices
the stall holders can charge and that it will
have a profit-sharing royalty scheme with
the stall holders? What will be the price of a
crepe at each stall?


4. Return to Problem 3 above. Suppose now that
CC requires that each stall holder deliver the
crepes in its own designated territory. How
many franchises should now be awarded if
we make the standard assumption that the
effort costs of the stall holders are the same
as those of the sun bathers? How would your
answer change if the stall holders instead
incurred effort costs half as much as those
of the sun bathers, that is, if their costs
were 12.5 cents for every quarter mile of
distance?


5. Imagine that Dell is considering two versions of a new laptop. One version will
meet high performance standards. The other
will only meet medium performance standards. To make the second, Dell uses cheaper


170 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice



materials and then crimps the keyboard of the
high-performance machine with the result
that the marginal cost of the each product is an identical $500. There are two
types of consumers for the new laptop.
“Techies” have the (indirect) utility function
_Vt_ 2000 _(z_ 1 _)_ . “Norms” have the (indirect) utility function =   - _Vn_ 1000 _z_, where _z_ is
a measure of product quality. Dell can choose =
the quality level _z_ for each machine from the
interval (1,3), subject only to the restriction
that the medium-performance machine have
a lower _z_ quality than the high-performance
machine. If Dell knows that there are _Nt_
Techies and _Nn_ Norms, and if Dell also can
identify which type any consumer is, what
is its optimum price and product quality
strategy?


6. Return to Problem 5, above. Suppose Dell
cannot identify each customer but only
knows the numbers of each type. Show that

LOCATION CHOICE WITH TWO SHOPS


Shops have identical costs. Symmetry implies each is located a distance _d_ from each market
endpoint.

1. _d_ ≤ 1 _/_ 4: If _d_ is less than [1] _/_ 4, then the maximum full price that can be charged if
all consumers are to be served is determined by the consumers at the market center
( _x_ = [1] _/_ 2) and is equal to a price _p_ such that when transport costs are included, they pay
a full price equal to _V_ . Hence, the maximum price is:

This profit increases as _d_ gets larger. It follows therefore that _d_ should never be less
than [1] _/_ 4.

determined by consumers at the market endpoints ( _x_ = 0,1). The maximum price now
satisfies:

_π(d)_ = [ _p(d)_    - _c_ ] _N_    - _(V_    - _td_    - _c)N_ (7.A4)

This is decreasing in _d_ . Hence, _d_ should never exceed [1] _/_ 4. Given that _d_ should also
never be less than [1] _/_ 4, that profit maximization implies that _d_ = 1 _/_ 4 exactly.

It follows that the firm’s profit function is:

# **8** **Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales**

On November 5, 1999, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his “Findings of Fact”
in the Microsoft antitrust trial that served subsequently as the basis for Judge Jackson’s
guilty verdict in the trial five months later on April 3, 2000. Among other things, Judge
Jackson concluded that Microsoft’s _Windows_ operating system and its _Internet Explorer_
web browser constituted separate products that could, in principle, stand alone but that
Microsoft had bundled together as one package. Judge Jackson’s focus was on the use
of such bundling as an illegal tying of the two products aimed at extending Microsoft’s
operating systems monopoly to the browser market. Any defense against this charge must
offer an explanation for such bundling that is not related to extending monopoly power.

The remedy that Judge Jackson ordered was that Microsoft be broken into two separate
companies, one that would produce the operating system and the other that would produce
software components such as Microsoft _Office_ and _Internet Explorer_ . Judge Jackson’s
judgment was reversed on appeal, with the proposed settlement being that Microsoft share
its application programming interfaces, making it easier for competitors seeking to offer
_Windows_ -based applications to ensure that their software would operate seamlessly on the
_Windows_ platform.

A subsequent complaint was brought by the European Commission, accusing Microsoft
of abusing its dominant position by bundling _Windows Media Player_ ( _WMP_ ) with the
_Windows_ operating system. A preliminary judgment in 2003 required Microsoft to offer a
version of _Windows_ without _WMP_ and to provide the information necessary for a competitor
to offer a media player that would operate effectively on the _Windows_ platform. Microsoft
was also fined 497 million, a fine that was increased to a further 860 million in 2012
based on the finding that Microsoft had delayed implementing the 2004 judgment.

Is Microsoft’s behavior unique to that technology company? Far from it. The truth is that
most firms—both those with market power and those without it—sell more than one good,
and bundling or tying between a firm’s different products is frequently observed. What are
the possible gains to the firm from tying together the sale of its products? Are they solely
the anti-competitive, entry-deterring motives that worried Judge Jackson and the European
Commission? Does bundling raise both profit and efficiency, or does it earn profit at the
expense of efficiency? Do consumers win or lose from these bundling and tying tactics?
These are the questions we investigate in this chapter.

That consumers might actually gain from bundling seems possible when we examine the
prices that Microsoft charges, not for its _Windows_ operating system but for its software


174 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


applications. The Microsoft _Office_ suite is one of the most popular applications packages.
_Office Professional_ 2010 contains the _Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access_, and
_OneNote_ programs, priced in September 2012 at $400. You can buy the individual
components separately, _Word, Excel, Outlook_, and _Access_ selling for $140 each and
_OneNote_ for $80 _,_ a total of $780. In other words, there is a bundle discount of $380. The
question then becomes: what incentive does Microsoft have to engage in such bundling?
How does offering the _Office_ bundle help raise Microsoft’s profit?

Before proceeding we should make our analysis a bit more precise. In some cases,
firms like Microsoft market two or more products as an explicit bundle comprised of fixed
amounts of the individual components. Thus, the _Office_ suite contains exactly one copy of
each of the constituent programs; a fixed price menu at a restaurant contains one of each
of the included courses; and a holiday travel package might specify _one_ return flight to
London, _five_ nights’ accommodation, and _three_ West End plays.

There is an alternative to bundling, commonly referred to as tying. Under this strategy
a firm _ties_ the sale of one product to the purchase of another but does not control the
proportions in which the two products are consumed. Under a tying strategy the purchase of
some amount of one good (the tying good) requires that the buyer purchase a second product
(the tied good). For example, in the early days of business machines and computers IBM
sold its machines under the requirement that the buyer also use IBM-produced tabulating
cards. In other words, the purchase of the machine was tied to the additional purchase of
IBM cards. [1] We differentiate this from commodity bundling because IBM did not specify
the number of cards that the consumer had to purchase.

More recent examples of tied sales are not difficult to find. If you buy a computer printer
you also commit yourself to buying the unique ink cartridges that fit into that printer.
Hewlett-Packard cartridges do not fit Canon printers nor vice versa. Similarly, Sony’s _Play_
_Station_ game cartridges do not work on either a Nintendo _Wii_ or a Microsoft _Xbox_ system.
What is tied in all these cases is the brand (and seller) of the associated product, not its
quantity. You can always reduce your demand for Hewlett-Packard ink cartridges by being
very strict with yourself on how many drafts of a term paper you actually print out! These
modern examples of tie-in sales are _technology_ based rather than _contractual_ as in the
IBM case. Yet, whether contractual or technical, the issues we wish to address are the
motivations for and the implications of both tying and bundling practices. It is to a more
formal analysis of these questions that we now turn.


8.1 COMMODITY BUNDLING AND CONSUMER VALUATION


We begin with a story told almost thirty years ago by Nobel laureate, George Stigler, who
was one of the first to understand bundling as a means of exploiting differences in consumer
valuations of the goods on offer. [2] At the time that he published his brief analysis he was
responding to a recent Supreme Court case involving the movie industry. Throughout the
1950s and 1960s, airing older Hollywood films was a substantial part of television fare.
Film distributors who owned the rights to the films sold presentation rights for a fee to local


1 This tying policy was challenged as a violation of the Clayton Act in _International Business Machines_ v.
_U.S_ ., 298 U.S. 131 (1936). Similar charges arose repeatedly in the many private antitrust suits against IBM
in the following decades.
2 Stigler (1968).

television stations. However, they rarely sold films individually. Instead, they sold them in
packages typically combining screen gems such as _Casablanca_ and _Treasure of the Sierra_
_Madre_ with such “grade B” losers as _Gorilla Man_ and _Tear Gas Squad_ . [3] Stigler’s insight
was to recognize that while every television station valued the first two films (or others of
similar quality) more than the last two films, the relative valuations of the two types of
movies might well vary from station to station. Such differences provide a motive for the
observed bundling.

A modified version of Stigler’s example goes as follows. Suppose that there are two films,
X and Y, and two stations (located in different cities), A and B. Each station’s reservation
prices for the two films are as follows:



_Maximum Willingness_
_to Pay for Film X_



_Maximum Willingness to_
_Pay for Film Y_



Station A $8,000 $2,500
Station B $7,000 $4,000


As you may recall from earlier chapters, the film distributor can exploit these different
valuations by applying discriminatory prices. However, as you may also recall, price
discrimination must surmount the twin problems of identifying which station is which
and then avoiding arbitrage between stations. Suppose that this is not possible. Then the
distributor must charge a uniform price for each film, in which case its best bet is to charge
$7,000 for film X and $2,500 for film Y. At these prices, both stations buy both films, and
the distributor’s total revenue is $19,000 _._

Bundling, however, permits further revenues to be earned. Instead of selling the two
films separately, suppose that the distributor offers the films in a bundle to the two stations
for a combined price of $10,500. Because both stations value the bundle at least this highly,
the distributor sells both films to both stations. Its revenue now rises to $21,000 _._

The reason that bundling raises revenue is straightforward. It reduces the variation in
consumers’ willingness to pay. In turn, this reduction in variance effectively makes the
demand curve more elastic with the result that a relatively small price reduction will
generate a substantial demand increase. In the film example above, selling a second unit
of film X requires a price drop of $1,000 while selling a second unit of film Y requires
a price drop of $1,500 when each is sold separately. When offered as a bundle however,
selling a second packaged unit requires a price drop of only $500. Bundling works because
the variation in the willingness to pay for individual products is likely to be reduced when
those products are packaged together.

Stigler’s insight into bundling is surely valid. However, his analysis is incomplete on
a number of fronts. First, his model implies that for bundling to be profitable consumer
valuations must be distributed in a particular way. Suppose, for example that Station B
also has a value for film Y of $2,500. Then the bundle price is $9,500 _,_ implying a total
revenue of $19,000 with bundling which does no better than offering the films separately.
In this case, there is no variation in the willingness to pay for film Y and bundling is not a
profit-enhancing strategy. Second, Stigler’s analysis does not address the central concern of
the US Department of Justice and the European Commission: bundling as an entry deterring


3 See _United States v. Loew’s Inc_ ., 371 U.S. 38 (1962).


176 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


strategy. Third, Stigler’s model fails to consider the strategy of _mixed bundling_ —that is,
selling both products individually as well as in a bundle. It is to these issues that we now
turn.

To do so we begin with a variant of a (relatively) simple model developed by Nalebuff
(2007). Assume that there are two goods, labeled 1 and 2. Each of these goods is produced
with constant marginal (and average) cost that for the moment we assume to be zero. In
other words, we assume that there are no cost advantages of multiproduct production. In
particular, there are no scope economies of the type discussed in Chapter 4. Accordingly,
the marginal cost of producing a bundle or a package consisting of one unit of each good is
also zero.

We assume that each consumer buys exactly one unit of each good per unit of time
provided that the price charged is less than the reservation price for that good. The
consumer’s reservation price, or maximum willingness to pay, for good 1 is _R_ 1 and for
good 2 is _R_ 2. We further assume that the consumer’s reservation price for a commodity
bundle consisting of one unit of each good is _RB_ _R_ 1 _R_ 2. This assumption, that the
reservation price for the bundle is the sum of the reservation prices for the individual = +
goods, is a common one (and one made by Stigler as well). Yet the assumption is, at least
in some circumstances, restrictive. If the two goods are complementary goods, such as
nuts and bolts, the assumption is almost certainly false. We expect that the willingness to
pay for bolts is quite low in the absence of any nuts and vice versa. In other words, for
complementary goods the reservation price for the bundle is likely to be higher than the
sum of the separate reservation prices for each good consumed separately. Yet while the
assumption thaton the profit and other motives for bundling. We return to the case of complementary goods _RB_ = _R_ 1 + _R_ 2 is restrictive, it is also useful. It permits us to focus explicitly
in section 8.3.

Suppose that consumers differ in their separate valuations of the two goods—that is, the
values of _R_ 1 and _R_ 2 (and so _RB_ ) vary across consumers. Some consumers have a high _R_ 1
and a low _R_ 2 for others just the reverse is true. Some place a high value on both goods. For
;
others, _R_ 1 and _R_ 2 are both quite low. If we draw a quadrant with _R_ 1 on the horizontal axis
and _R_ 2 on the vertical axis as in Figure 8.1, then our assumptions allow us to define each

consumer’s type by a point in the _(R_ 1 _, R_ 2 _)_ quadrant. For example, consumers of type _a_ in
Figure 8.1 have reservations prices _R_ 1 _a_ for good 1 and _R_ 2 _a_ for good 2 while consumers of
type _b_ have reservations prices _R_ 1 _b_ for good 1 and _R_ 2 _b_ for good 2.

We make two further assumptions. First, we assume that that consumer valuations _R_ 1
and _R_ 2 are distributed on the range [0, 1] so that the “market” can be described by the unit
square as in Figure 8.1. Secondly, we assume that consumers are uniformly distributed at
density _D_ over this market. In other words, there are as many consumers of type _a_ as there
are of type _b_ or of any other type in the market. These might on first sight appear to be
limiting assumptions, but Nalebuff (2007) shows that if anything they understate the power
of bundling to increase profit and deter entry.


8.1.1 Bundling and Profitability

Suppose first that the firm prices its two products separately, setting a price _p_ 1 for good 1
and _p_ 2 for good 2 as in Figure 8.2. It follows that all consumers with reservation prices
Figure 8.2, all consumers in region A buy only good 1, those in region B buy only good _R_ 1 ≥ _p_ 1 buy good 1 and all consumers with reservation prices _R_ 2 ≥ _p_ 2 buy good 2. In
2, those in region C buy both goods 1 and 2, while those in region D buy neither good.
This non-italicized D implies a portion of the market space while the italicized _D_ implies
market density. Aggregate demand for good 1 is the number of consumers in the rectangle
A + C and for good 2 is the number of consumers in the rectangle B + C. In other words,
_q_ 1 _D(_ 1 _p_ 1 _)_ and _q_ 2 _D(_ 1 _p_ 2 _)._
=Writing these demand functions in our familiar inverse form we have: − =  

_p_ 1 1 _q_ 1 _/D_ _p_ 2 1 _q_ 2 _/D_ (8.1)

At monopoly prices _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 Group A buys only product 1, Group B buys only product 2, Group C buys both

Equating marginal revenue with marginal cost (assumed equal to zero) gives

and from (8.1)

These are just the monopoly prices for the two products when they are sold separately.
Profit from this non-bundling strategy is:


_πnb_ 0.5 _D_
=

Assume instead that the firm decides to offer the two products only as a bundle, with the
bundle priced at _pB <_ 1. [4] This is illustrated in Figure 8.3.

Now consumers are partitioned into two groups. Each consumer in region E has
reservation prices for the two goods the sum of which is greater than _pB_ and so buys the
bundle. By contrast, each consumer in region F has reservation prices for the two goods
the sum of which is less than _pB_ and so does not buy the bundle. Aggregate demand for
the bundle is the number of consumers in region E, which is the total numer of potential
consumers _D_ minus the number of consumers in the triangle _F_ . In other words, aggregate
demand for the bundle at price _pB_ is

Table 8.1 evaluates this profit function for a range of bundle prices, from which we
can conclude that the optimal bundle price is approximately _pB_ 0.8. (We show in the
Appendix to this chapter that the profit maximizing bundle price is actually = _pB_ 0.816
and that the resulting profit from the bundling strategy is 0.5443 _D._ ) =

As you can see, bundling increases profit by approximately 8.8 percent, not bad but
perhaps not a lot to write home about or cause concern to the anti-trust authorities. Which
brings us to the other possibility: that bundling is an entry-deterring device.


8.1.2 Bundling and Entry Deterrence


We continue with our simple model but now assume that the incumbent firm faces the
threat of entry by a potential challenger that, by incurring fixed entry costs of _F,_ can offer a
perfect substitute for the incumbent’s product 2. The incumbent remains the sole producer
of product 1 whether or not entry takes place. [5]

Suppose first that the incumbent does not adopt a bundling strategy. Because it faces no
challenge in its market for product 1, its price for that product is unaffected at _p_ 1 1 _/_ 2
and its profit from selling product 1 remains _D/_ 4. By contrast, in its product 2 market the =
incumbent has to identify a price that will deter entry. Suppose that the incumbent sets a
price of _p_ 2 _<_ 1 _/_ 2. The best strategy for the potential entrant is to just undercut that price,
thereby stealing all of the incumbent’s product 2 consumers. In Figure 8.4, consumers in
regions A and C buy product 1 from the incumbent, while those in regions B and C switch
to purchase product 2 from the entrant provided only that the entrant sets a price _p_ 2 _ε_
“just less” than _p_ 2 _._ 
Profit to the entrant is


_πE_ _Dp_ 2 _(_ 1 _p_ 2 _)_ _F_ (8.5)
=   -   
In order to deter entry, the incumbent has to set _p_ 2 to ensure that _πE <_ 0. Define _f_ = _F/D,_
so that _f_ is entry cost per consumer. We show in the Appendix that the entry-deterring
price for the incumbent is



1 − 4 _f )_ (8.6)

5 Assuming that the entrant can offer only one product replicates our Microsoft example. Nalebuff (2007)
assumes that the entrant can randomly produce either good 1 or good 2, which introduces complications
that we would rather avoid. We address the credibility of entry deterrence in a two-product case in
subsequent chapters.

**Figure 8.4** An incumbent threatened by entry—no bundling
The entrant sells product 2 to consumers is Groups B and C; the incumbent sells product 1 to consumers in
Groups A and C.


Rather than use calculus, however, we adopt a simpler approach. Equation (8.5) can
be used to identify, for a range of product 2 prices, the entry cost per consumer above
which entry is unprofitable and so is deterred. Suppose, for example, that the incumbent
sets price _p_ 2 0.4. Then, from equation (8.5), the entrant, by just undercutting this price,
earns profit 0.4 = _D(_ 1 − 0.4 _)_ - _F_ = 0.24 _D_ - _F_ . This is negative, and entry is deterred, for
_f_ = _F/D_ ≥ 0.24. The results for this analysis are presented in Table 8.2.

Now think of this another way. Suppose that entry cost per consumer is _f_ = 0.24. Then
from Table 8.2 we can see that the incumbent can deter entry by setting its product 2 price
at “just less” than 0.4: a price that completely limits entry. By applying such a _limit price_
the incumbent earns aggregate profit _D(_ 0.25 + 0.24 _)_ = 0.49 _D_ . The first term in brackets is
the monopoly profit from product 1 and the second is profit from product 2 given that price
is set to deter entry. More generally, we can see from Table 8.2 that if the entrant’s entry
cost per consumer is _f,_ entry deterrence gives the incumbent aggregate profit _D(_ 0.25 + _f )._

This kind of entry deterrence is always profitable for the incumbent provided only that
_f >_ 0. Note also that entry is actually blockaded—not possible even if the incumbent
adopts the simple monopoly price for product 2 —provided that _f >_ 0.25 _._

Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 181


Now suppose that the incumbent adopts a product bundling strategy, setting the bundle
price at _pB_ 1 and assume that the potential entrant sets its product 2 price at _p_ 2.
Consumers face three choices: continue to buy the bundle; switch to buying product 2 from ≤
the entrant, as a result of which the consumer cannot buy product 1; buy nothing. The
consumer, as usual, picks the option that maximizes consumer surplus.

Consider a consumer with reservation prices _(R_ 1 _, R_ 2 _)_ . If this consumer buys the bundle
from the incumbent the consumer surplus isswitches to buying only product 2 (from the entrant) the consumer surplus is _CSB_ = _R_ 1 + _R_ 2 − _pB_ while if the consumer _CS_ 2 _R_ 2 _p_ 2.
The consumers that switch to the entrant have reservation prices that satisfy two constraints: = 

_CS_ 2 _> CSB_ ⇒ _R_ 2 − _p_ 2 _> R_ 1 + _R_ 2 − _pB_ ⇒ _R_ 1 _< pB_  - _p_ 2 (8.7)

_CS_ 2 _>_ 0 ⇒ _R_ 2 _> p_ 2 (8.8)

Constraint (8.7) ensures that the consumer prefers to purchase product 2 from the entrant
rather than the bundle of product 1 and product 2 from the incumbent, while constraint (8.8)
ensures that the consumer prefers to purchase product 2 from the entrant than to purchase
nothing.

These constraints tell us that the consumers that switch from buying the bundle to
buying product 2 from the entrant are consumers (i) with relatively low reservation prices
for product 1—the product that they give up—and (ii) relatively high reservation prices for
product 2—the product that they continue to purchase. Intuitively, the entrant in competing
with the incumbent’s bundled product is most likely to capture those consumers who really
like product 2 but place a low valuation on product 1.

These constraints are illustrated in Figure 8.5. Constraint (8.8) is simply illustrated. Now
consider constraint (8.7). Because the line _pBpB_ has slope −1, the distance _ab_ equals the
distance _bc_ and both _ab_ and _bc_ _pB_ _p_ 2. Thus all consumers with reservation prices to
the left of the vertical line _dce_ satisfy constraint (8.7) and all consumers in the region A = - + B
satisfy _both_ constraints (8.7) and (8.8).

In the absence of entry, consumers in regions B, C, and D purchase the bundle while
consumers in regions A, E, and F do not. Post-entry, consumers in regions A and B purchase
product 2 from the entrant, consumers in regions C and D continue to buy the bundle from
the incumbent, while consumers in regions E and F buy neither the bundle nor the entrant’s
product 2.

It is here that we see the beginning of an explanation for why bundling might be an
entry-deterring strategy. Suppose that the incumbent, instead of bundling, had priced the
in Figure 8.5. If the entrant had priced product 2 at “Just less” thantwo products separately, with product 2 priced at _p_ 2 and product 1 priced at _p_ 2 as in our analysis _p_ 1 = _pB_ - _p_ 2
above, the entrant would have gained all consumers in regions A, B, and C, many more
consumers than are gained when the incumbent bundles.

We can make this more precise. As we have seen in Figure 8.5, given that the incumbent
sets the bundle price at _pB_ the entrant, setting its product 2 price at _p_ 2 _,_ gains consumers in
region A B _,_ whose area is _(_ 1 _p_ 2 _)(pB_ _p_ 2 _)_ . Profit to the entrant is then:
+    -    
_πE_ _Dp_ 2 _(_ 1 _p_ 2 _)(pB_ _p_ 2 _)_ _F_ (8.9)
=   -   -   
A comparison with equation (8.5) indicates that, as we just suggested, the bundling strategy
by the incumbent makes entry much less profitable, in other words, easier to deter.

**Figure 8.5** An incumbent threatened by entry—pure bundling
Post-entry consumers in Groups A and B buy product 2 from the entrant, consumers in Groups C and D buy the
bundle from the incumbent, consumers in Groups E and F do not buy from either the incumbent or the entrant.


With bundling, the incumbent actually has to go through a two-stage thought process in
formulating its entry-deterring strategy. First, for any bundle price, the incumbent should
expect the entrant to choose its entry price to maximize its profit as given by equation (8.9).
We derive the optimal price for the entrant in the Appendix. Second, given this price for
the entrant, the incumbent has to identify the bundle price that just deters entry.

Rather than take this analytical approach, however, we mirror the non-bundling case by
presenting a simplified numerical analysis. Table 8.3 gives the potential entrant’s profit,
_ignoring its entry costs_, for a range of combinations of the bundle price _pB_ and the entrant’s
price _p_ 2. Given our analysis in the previous section, we can confine our attention to bundle
prices less than 0.8.

Suppose first that the incumbent acts as a monopolist facing no entry threat and sets a
bundle price of 0.8. Then Table 8.3 tells us that the best the entrant can do is set a price for
product 2 of approximately 0.3, giving the entrant profit of 0.105 _D_ - _F_ . This tells us that
entry is blockaded with the bundling strategy for any entry cost per consumer _f >_ 0.105.
Contrast this with the non-bundling strategy. We saw there that for entry to be blockaded
requires that _f >_ 0.25. In other words, bundling significantly increases the range of entry


**Table 8.3** Entrant’s gross profit—product bundling

costs for which the incumbent is free of the threat of entry without the need to adopt a
specific entry-deterring price.

We can repeat this analysis for different incumbent prices for the bundle. Suppose, for
example, that the bundle is priced at 0.7. Then the entrant will set its product price _p_ 2 to
approximately 0.25, earning profit 0.0844 _D_ - _F_ . We can put this another way. Suppose
that entry cost per consumer is _f_ = 0.0844. Then the incumbent can deter entry by setting
a bundle price “just less” than 0.7, earning profit 0.529 _D_ . Similarly, if entry cost per
consumer is _f_ = 0.066 _,_ the incumbent can deter entry by setting the bundle price “just
less” than 0.6, earning profit 0.492 _D,_ and if entry cost per consumer is _f_ = 0.048 entry is
deterred by a bundle price of 0.5, giving the incumbent profit of 0.438 _D._

We summarize these results in Table 8.4 from which we can see the real strategic
power of bundling as an entry deterring device. If _f >_ 0.25 _,_ entry is blockaded whether
or not the incumbent bundles and bundling increases profit, but only by 8.8 percent. If
0.25 _> f >_ 0.105 _,_ entry is feasible without bundling but blockaded by bundling. Product
bundling increases profit by up to 53 percent. At lower entry costs per consumer, bundling
is less profitable, but even with _f_ as low as 0.048 bundling increases profit by 47 percent.

The conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is straightforward. Product bundling is
indeed a potent entry-deterring strategy, justifying the concerns that the anti-trust authorities
have with this strategy.


8.1.3 Mixed Bundling


While Microsoft attempted to apply a pure bundling strategy with respect to the sale of its
_Windows_ operating system (bundling _Windows_ with _Explorer_ and _Windows Media Player_ ),
it applies a rather different strategy with respect to its _Office_ suite of programs. As we noted
above, consumers can purchase the full suite of _Office_ programs _or_ they can purchase some
but not necessarily all of the individual programs. This is an example of _mixed bundling_ .

A possible explanation for the difference in strategy can be suggested. Microsoft had an
effective monopoly on operating systems with its _Windows_ program and so had the potential
to leverage that monopoly into browsers and media player software. By contrast, Microsoft
faces competition from established companies offering word processing, spreadsheet, and
presentation programs. The best that it can do is to adopt some kind of profit maximizing
strategy, mixed bundling being one such strategy.

184 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Returning to our simple model of the last two sections, the monopolist applying a mixed
bundling strategy offers to sell the two goods separately at specified prices, respectively, of
_p_ 1 and _p_ 2 (which are not necessarily the monopoly prices) and also sells them as a bundle
at price _pB_ (again not necessarily the monopoly pure bundle price). Of course, for this to
make sense, it must again be the case thatever purchase the bundle. Figure 8.6 illustrates such a strategy. The monopolist offers _pB < p_ 1 + _p_ 2. Otherwise, no consumer would
consumers the possibility of buying either product 1 or product 2 individually at the stated
prices or buying them as a bundle at price _pB._

We now show that consumers are partitioned by this strategy into four groups. To do so,
we need to determine the conditions under which a consumer will prefer to buy only one of
the two goods or the bundle or nothing.

Clearly, anyone who values good 1 at more than _p_ 1 and good 2 at more than _p_ 2 _,_ that
is, anyone who is willing to buy both goods at the individual prices, will buy the bundle
because its price is less than the sum of the individual prices. Consider now a consumer
whose reservation price for good 1 is less than _p_ 1. If this consumer buys anything, the
consumer will buy either the bundle or only good 2. Of course, the consumer will make
the choice that gives the greater consumer surplus. Suppose then that the corresponding
reservation prices are _R_ 1 for good 1 and _R_ 2 for good 2. If the bundle is purchased, the
bought, the consumer gets a consumer surplus ofconsumer pays _pB_ and gets a consumer surplus of _CS CS_ 2 _B_ = _R R_ 2 1 + _p R_ 2 _._ 2 − _pB_ . If only good 2 is

This type of consumer will buy only good 2 if two conditions are satisfied. First, =  _RCS_ 2 _> p_ 2 _> CS_ 2. We have already seen these conditions in our discussion of entry deterrence: see _B_ _,_ which requires that _R_ 1 _< pB_ - _p_ 2. Second, _CS_ 2 _>_ 0 _,_ which requires that
Figure 8.5. It follows that all consumers in the region _hef_ in Figure 8.6, such as consumer
_y,_ buy only good 2.

By exactly the same argument, a consumer will buy only good 1 if two conditions are
in Figure 8.6 by the linesatisfied: first _R_ 2 _< pB_ - _jadp_ 1 and second and all points to the right of _R_ 1 _> p_ 1. The difference _ab_ represent consumers for _pB_ - _p_ 1 is illustrated
whom _R_ 1 _> p_ 1. Therefore, all consumers with reservation prices in the region _dab_, such as
consumer _x,_ will buy only good 1.

_jad_ . If such a consumer buys anything at all it will be the bundle, as this gives more
consumer surplus than either only good 1 or only good 2. For this consumer to buy the
bundle it is then necessary thatmust put the consumer above the line _R_ 1 + _caeg R_ 2 _> p_ in Figure 8.6. In other words, all consumers in _B,_ which means that the reservation prices
the region _daeh_, such as consumer _z_, will buy the bundle.

This leaves only the region _feab_ . What will be the choice of these types of consumers?
Their reservation prices are less than the individual prices of the two goods, so they will
not buy either good individually. In addition, the sum of their reservation prices is less than
the bundle price, so they will not buy the bundle. Consumers in _feab_ do not buy anything.

Derivation of the optimal individual and bundle prices for our “simple” model is actually
very complex. For the interested reader the derivation is provided in this chapter’s Appendix.
It turns out that for this model these prices are _p_ 1 _p_ 2 2 _/_ 3 and _pB_ 0.862 _,_ giving the
monopolist aggregate profit 0.549 _D_, greater than either simple monopoly pricing or pure = = =
bundling.


8.1.4 A Worked Example


When we compare either pure or mixed bundling with simple monopoly pricing, it is clear
that mixed bundling always increases the monopolist’s _sales_ . What is less clear is whether
bundling will increase the monopolist’s _profits_ . What we should expect is that the profit
impact of commodity bundling will depend upon the distribution of consumer preferences
for the goods being offered and the costs of making those goods, issues that our formal
model has not really considered. An example will serves to illustrate this and some of the
other ideas introduced so far.

Assume that the monopolist knows that it has four consumers, A, B, C, and D, each
interested in buying the two goods, 1 and 2. The marginal cost of good 1 is _c_ 1 $100 and
of good 2 is _c_ 2 $150. Each consumer has reservation prices for these two goods, as given =
in Table 8.5, and buys exactly one unit of either good in any period so long as its price is =
less than the reservation price for that good. Each consumer will consider buying the goods
as a bundle provided that the bundle price is less than the sum of the reservation prices.

Suppose that the monopolist decides to sell the goods unbundled and adopts simple
monopoly pricing. Table 8.6 allows us to identify the profit-maximizing monopoly prices
for the two goods. Profit from good 1 is maximized at $450 by setting a price of $250 and
selling to consumers B, C, and D. Profit from good 2 is maximized at $300 by setting a
price of $450 and selling only to consumer A. Total profit from simple monopoly pricing
is, therefore, $750 _._

Now consider the pure bundling strategy. The firm can: 1) choose a bundle price of
$525 _,_ which will attract only consumer B; 2) choose a bundle price of $520 _,_ which
will attract consumers B and C; or 3) choose a bundle price of $500 _,_ which will attract
all four consumers. The third strategy is preferable because it yields a total profit of
4 _(_ $500 − $100 − $150 _),_ or $1,000. Pure bundling is, in this case, preferable to simple
monopoly pricing. However, under bundling, consumer A is able to consume good 1 and
consumer D is able to consume good 2 even though they each value the relevant good
at less than its marginal production costs. (This is also a feature of pure bundling in the
previous model if we introduce non-zero marginal costs to that model.)

Can a mixed bundling strategy do better? Suppose first that the monopolist merely
combines the simple monopoly and pure bundling strategies. That is, the firm sets a price of
$250 for good 1, $450 for good 2, and $500 for the bundle. How will consumers respond to
this pricing and product offering? Consumer A will not buy just good 1, and is indifferent
between buying the bundle or only good 2 because in either case, the consumer earns zero
surplus. However, the firm is definitely not indifferent. The firm makes a profit of $300 if
consumer A buys just good 2 but only $250 if consumer A buys the bundle. Hence, the firm
would like to find a way to encourage consumer A to opt only for good 2.

Now consider Consumer D. This consumer earns the greatest surplus if only good 1 is
purchased, in which case consumer surplus is $200. Therefore, Consumer D will buy only
good 1 and the profit to the monopolist from that sale will be $150. In this consumer’s case,
the monopolist would actually prefer that Consumer D buy the bundle at $500 from which
the monopolist earns a profit of $250. Finally, consider consumers B and C. They are each
unwilling to buy either good separately at the stated prices. However, each will buy the
bundle giving a combined profit to the monopolist from both sales of $500 _._

Adding up the sales and related profits, we find that the proposed mixed bundling strategy
gives the monopolist a total profit of $900 or $950 _,_ depending upon whether consumer A
buys the bundle or only good 2. This is certainly better than simple monopoly pricing profit
derived earlier of $750. But it is not as good as the profit of $1,000 earned in the pure
bundling case of selling only the bundle at a price of $500 _._

However, with a little thought, it is easy to see how the monopolist can alter the current
mixed bundling strategy to raise profits further. The insight is to change the prices to
sort customers into different purchase choices. We have already noted that Consumer A
is indifferent to buying just good 2 or the bundle at the current prices. A slight rise in
the bundle price say, to $520 _,_ will definitely tilt this consumer to purchasing just good 2.
Suppose that in addition the firm also raises the price of good 1 to $450 _,_ so that the new
price configuration is: _pB_ $520 _, p_ 1 $450 _,_ and _p_ 2 $450. Consumer A will now buy
good 2. Consumer D will continue to buy good 1 and Consumers B and C will continue to = = =
buy the bundle. However, the price increases for good 1 and the bundle, respectively, let


Commodity Bundling and Tie-In Sales 187


the monopolist earn an additional profit of $200 on its sale of good 1 to Consumer D, and
$40 on its two bundle sales to Consumers B and C, while guaranteeing profit of $300 from
Consumer A. Total profit is $300 + $270 + $270 + $350 = $1,190 _,_ which _does_ exceed
our pure bundling maximum.

This is actually the best that the monopolist can do in this example. The monopolist
has extracted the entire consumer surplus of consumers A, C, and D and all but $5 of the
consumer surplus of consumer B. In other words, the monopolist has done nearly as well as
it would have done if it had been able to adopt first-degree price discrimination.

Mixed bundling (in which the bundle price is less than the price of buying each component
separately) is always at least as profitable as pure bundling. The reason is simple enough
to see. The worst that a mixed bundling strategy can do is to replicate the pure bundling
strategy by setting arbitrarily high individual prices and a bundle price equal to the pure
bundle price. However, it will usually be possible to improve on this by setting individual
component prices that are sufficiently low to attract those who really just want the one item
but high enough to earn more profit than can be earned from the bundle.

We should note, though, that while mixed bundling must always improve profits relative
to pure bundling, it is not always the case that some sort of bundling is more profitable than
no bundling at all. A drawback to bundling—one illustrated in the previous example—is
that it can lead to an outcome in which some of the consumers who buy the bundle actually
have a reservation price for one of the goods that is less than marginal production cost. This
is inefficient and so the firm too would prefer a different pricing scheme. Our example also
demonstrates that bundling, whether pure or mixed, is likely to be profitable only when the
variation in consumer valuations of the goods is significant. In our example, consumers A
and D—who buy a single good—have very different valuations of the individual goods. In
contrast, consumers B and C—who buy the bundled good—have very similar valuations.
Adams and Yellen (1976) made clear that the gains from bundling arise from the differences
in consumer valuations.


Some people may value an appetizer relatively highly (soup on a cold day), others may
value dessert relatively higher (Baked Alaska, unavailable at home), but all may wish to pay
roughly the same amount for a complete dinner. The `a la carte menu is designed to capture
consumer surplus from those gastronomes with extremely high valuations of particular dishes,
while the complete dinner is designed to retain those with lower variance. (Adams and Yellen
1976, 488)


We can see the same basic point in the context of the Stigler example with which we
started. If station A valued both movies at $8,000 and station B valued both at $3,500 _,_ the
differences in the relative valuation of the products would vanish. In that case, bundling
would no longer be a profitable strategy.

Note also that because the bundle price _pB_ is less than the sum of the individual prices
_p_ price serves to attract consumers who place a relatively low value on one or other of the1 + _p_ 2 commodity bundling can be viewed as discriminatory pricing. The lower bundle
two goods but are willing to pay a reasonable sum for the bundle. The two separate prices
serve to extract surplus from those customers who have a great willingness to pay for only
one of the products. We would therefore expect most multiproduct firms with monopoly
power to engage in some sort of mixed bundling.

Mixed bundling is in fact a common practice. Restaurants serve combination platters and
also offer items individually. Resorts often offer food and lodging both separately and as a


188 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


package. Software companies sell individual products but also offer packages consisting of
several applications, such as Microsoft’s _Office_ package. Some of this surely reflects price
discrimination efforts.


is the Walt Disney Movie channel. The potential subscribers for the services—students,
families, hotels, schools, young adults, and retirees—regard the two services as separate
alternatives, that is, not as complementary products. So, the demands for the two services

8.2 REQUIRED TIE-IN SALES


Tie-in sale arrangements differ from bundling in that they tie together the purchase of two
or more products without prescribing the amount that must be bought of at least one of these
products. A further difference commonly but not always observed is that the tied goods
typically exhibit a complementary relationship with each other whereas bundled goods
need not. We now turn to a somewhat magical example to illustrate why tying is often an
effective marketing strategy.

Consider an imaginary product called a _Magicam_ that is produced by only one firm,
Rowling Corp. A _Magicam_ is much like an ordinary camera with one exception—the
figures in a _Magicam_ photograph can actually move and even wave back at the picture
viewer because of Rowling’s patented, magical method of placing the images on film. In all
