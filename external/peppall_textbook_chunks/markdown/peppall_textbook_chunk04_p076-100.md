# **4** **Technology and Cost**

In late 2001, Microsoft introduced its first _Xbox_ video game console. The relatively simple
model for which only a few games were available sold at a retail price of $300. By 2004,
the price had fallen to $150 despite technical improvements, as Microsoft prepared to
launch the new _Xbox 360_ series. The base or _Core_ model 360 emerged in 2005 at a price
of $300—a price that fell to $200 in 2008 as the _Core_ model was replaced by the _Arcade_
series with initially a 60GB hard drive. That price fell further over the next two years, even
as the hard drive capacity grew to 250GB and more features and games were added. As
this text is going to press, an _Xbox 360S_ series along with a _Kinect_ scanner that allows
full-body gaming is selling as a bundle for $250. In sum, the price of an _Xbox_ game console
has declined over the last decade—especially if the vastly improved technical features are
considered—despite the fact that the prices of other consumer goods have risen over 25
percent (about 2.6 percent per year) in that same time period.

Clearly, Microsoft’s pricing strategy reflects in part its rivalry with other video game
platform producers such as Sony and Nintendo. Yet the above prices must also reflect _Xbox_
production costs because the profitability of any price choice will depend critically on the
cost of producing each unit of the total sold at that price. More generally, production costs
affect both firm behavior and industrial structure. The four firms—General Mills, Kellogg,
General Foods (Post), and Quaker Oats currently account for about 80 percent of sales in
the US ready-to-eat breakfast cereal industry. By contrast, the largest four manufacturers
of games and toys account for 35 to 45 percent of these products—less if video games are
included. In this chapter, we introduce key cost concepts that are relevant to understanding
such dramatic differences in industry structure. [1]


4.1 PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND COST FUNCTIONS FOR
SINGLE PRODUCT FIRMS


What is a firm’s technology? For our purposes, the firm’s technology is a production
relationship that describes how a given quantity of inputs is transformed into the firm’s
output. In this sense, we adopt the traditional neoclassical approach in which a firm is solely

Technology and Cost 65


envisioned as a production unit. The goal of this production unit is profit maximization,
which, in turn, implies minimizing the cost of making any given level of output.

The neoclassical approach is not without its weaknesses. While it does indicate how
the firm’s production plans change in response to changes in input and output prices, it
says little about how that plan is actually implemented or managed. In other words, it says
little about what happens inside the firm, and more specifically, about how the various
competing interests of management, workers, and shareholders are reconciled in the design
and implementation of a production plan. [2]

Moreover, whatever happens within a firm, it is clear that these internal relationships
are different from the external ones that exist between the firm and those outside the firm
such as customers and suppliers. A market typically mediates these external relationships.
Customers and suppliers buy from and sell to the firm at market prices. Inside the firm,
however, relationships are organized by non-market methods, such as hierarchical control.
Thus, as eloquently argued by Nobel laureate Ronald Coase (1937), the boundary of the
firm is really the boundary between the use of non-market business transactions and market
ones. The question Coase then raised is what determines this boundary. Why is it that
production of a good is distributed across many different firms instead of a few large ones?
Indeed, what limits are there to having all production organized by one or a few giant,
multidivisional, and multiplant firms?

The questions raised by Coase (1973) cannot be answered within the simple neoclassical
view of the firm. This is not to say though that economics cannot address these issues
at all. Over the years, a large number of scholars have developed theories of the firm
typically rooted in the recognition of two facts. First, it is typically not possible to write
contracts that cover all possible contingencies. Contracts must therefore be incomplete.
Second, information is often asymmetric. Managers have information that is not accessible
to shareholders. Employees know things that managers do not.

The fact that contracts cannot be complete may require an authority relationship, typically
within a firm as a means of dealing with all the contingencies not covered by the contract
(Williamson 1975). This is particularly true when specialized investments are required that
will only be profitable if the two contracting parties, say a firm and its supplier, continue
working together. Otherwise, once such an investment is made, the party that paid for it
may find itself at a disadvantage in setting contract terms, e.g., the supply price because it
has little alternative use for these assets (Williamson 1975, Grossman and Hart 1986, Hart
and Moore 1990, and Hart 1995). Likewise, the fact of asymmetric information can give
rise to free-riding and moral hazard problems that can only be resolved by an organizational
structure that includes someone who monitors the work efforts of others and, in return,
receives a residual payment to insure that there is an incentive to do this job efficiently
(Alchian and Demsetz 1972, Holmstrom 1982, and Holmstrom and Milgrom 1994). These
and related issues concerning the nature of the firm continue to be important topics of
economic research, as evidenced by Daniel Spulber’s recent book (2009).

Yet while the neoclassical approach to firm size and market structure is not without its
limitations, the approach does remain insightful. For our purposes, it is useful to be aware
of the issues raised by the agency and transactions cost literature, but to explore those
concerns at all satisfactorily would take us beyond the boundary of this book. As long as its
limitations are recognized, the neoclassical view of the firm will permit us to accomplish
many of our objectives. Therefore keep in mind throughout the following discussion that

a firm is interpreted as simply a profit-maximizing production unit and not a complex
organization.


4.1.1 Key Cost Concepts


Standard microeconomic theory describes a firm in terms of its production technology. A
firm producing the quantity _q_ of a single product is characterized by its production function
_q_ _f_ _(x_ 1 _, x_ 2 _, . . ., xk)_ . This function specifies the quantity _q_ that the firm produces from
=
using _k_ different inputs at levels _x_ 1 for the first input, _x_ 2 for the second input, and so on
through the _k_ th input of which _xk_ is used. The technology is reflected in the precise form of
the function, _f_ _( )_ . In turn, the nature of this technology will be a central determinant of the
firm’s costs.

The firm is treated as a single decision-making unit that chooses output _q_ and the
associated inputs _x_ 1 _, x_ 2 _, . . ., xk_ to maximize profits. It is convenient to approach this
choice by first identifying the relationship between a firm’s output and its resulting
production costs—which is simply the firm’s cost function. That is, for any specific output
~~_q_~~ and given the prices _w_ 1 _, w_ 2 _, . . ., wk_ of the _k_ inputs, there is a unique way to choose the
level of each input _x_ 1 _, x_ 2 _, . . ., xk_ so as to minimize the total cost of producing ~~_q_~~ ~~.~~ The firm
obtains this solution by choosing the input combination that solves the problem:



_Minimize_

_xi_




- _k_

(4.1)
_i_ 1 _[w][i][x][i]_
=



subject to the constraint _f_ _(x_ 1 _, x_ 2 _, . . ., xk)_ ~~_q_~~ .
=

If we solve this problem for different levels of output ~~_q_~~, we will obtain the minimum
cost of each possible production level per unit of time. This relationship between costs and
output is what is described by the cost function for the firm. We typically denote the firm’s
cost function by the expression _C(q)_ + _F_, from which we can then derive three key cost
concepts: fixed cost, average or unit cost, and marginal cost.


1. _Fixed cost_ : The fixed cost concept is reflected in the term _F_ . This term represents a
given amount of expenditure that the firm must incur each period and that is unrelated to
how much output the firm produces. That is, the firm must incur _F_ whether it produces
zero or a thousand units, hence the term, fixed. This is distinct from the variable cost
portion described by _C(q)_ that does vary as output changes. Costs that may be fixed
include interest costs associated with financing a particular size of plant and advertising
costs. Note, however, that often these costs may be fixed only in the short run. Over
a longer period of time, the firm can adjust what plant size it wants to operate and its
promotional efforts. If this is true, then these costs are not fixed over a longer period of
time.
2. _Average cost_ : The firm’s average cost is simply a measure of the expenditure per
unit of production and is given by total cost divided by total output. This cost
measure does depend on output, hence its algebraic representation is _AC(q)_ . Formally,
_AC(q)_ = [ _C(q)_ + _F_ ] _/q_ . We may also decompose average cost into its fixed and variable
components. Average fixed cost is simply total fixed cost per unit of output, or _F/q_ .
Average variable cost _AVC(q)_ is similarly just the total variable cost per unit of output,
_C(q)/q_ . Alternatively, average variable cost is just average cost less average fixed cost,
_AVC(q)_ = _AC(q)_  - _F/q_ .


Technology and Cost 67


3. _Marginal cost_ : The firm’s marginal cost _MC(q)_ is calculated as the addition to total
cost that is incurred in increasing output by one unit. Alternatively, marginal cost can
be defined as the savings in total cost that is realized as the firm decreases output by
one unit. [3]


We now add a fourth key cost concept— _sunk cost_ . Like fixed cost, sunk cost is a cost
that is unrelated to output. However, unlike fixed costs, which are incurred every period,
sunk cost is a cost that is only incurred prior to a specific date—often prior to the entry
date. For example, a doctor will need to acquire a license to operate. Similarly, a firm may
need to do market and product research or install highly specialized equipment before it
enters a market. The cost of the license, the research expenditures, and the expenditures
on specialized assets are likely to be unrelated to subsequent output, so in this sense they
are fixed. More importantly, should the doctor or firm subsequently decide to close down,
only part of these specialized expenditures will be recoverable. It will be difficult to sell the
license to another doctor and certainly not at the price that the first doctor paid. Similarly,
the research expenditures are unrecoverable on exit and it will not be possible to sell the
specialized assets for anything close to their initial acquisition costs. For example, the kilns
that are needed to manufacture cement have almost no alternative use other than as scrap
metal. Much of the capital cost that Toyota incurred in building its US car manufacturing
plants—production lines, robots, and other highly specialized machinery—likewise have
no other uses. By contrast, the airplanes used by JetBlue to open up a new route, say
between Boston and Miami, can be redeployed if passenger traffic on that route turns out to
be insufficient to continue its operation. Sunk costs, in other words, are initial entry costs
that are unrecoverable if the firm chooses later to exit the market.


4.1.2 Cost Variables and Output Decisions


Figure 4.1 depicts a standard textbook average cost function, _AC(q)_, and its corresponding
marginal cost function, _MC(q)_ . As discussed in Chapter 2, profit maximization over any
period of time requires that the firm produce where marginal revenue is equal to marginal

3 Formally, marginal cost is the slope of the total cost function and so is defined by the derivative term,
_MC(q)_ = _dC(q)/dq_ . (See Appendix.) Note that in the case of a multiplant firm, shifting one unit of
production to plant _i_ from plant _j_ while leaving total output unchanged, would change total cost by an
amount: _MCi_ _MCj_ . It follows that if _C(q)_ is a minimized, marginal cost is equalized across all plants.
      

68 Foundations


cost. Thus, with one important caveat, marginal cost is the relevant cost concept to
determine how much the firm should produce. That caveat is that marginal cost is important
for determining how much to produce _given_ that the firm is going to produce any output
at all.

Suppose, for example, that demand is very weak. In such a case, equating marginal cost
to marginal revenue may result in the price falling below average cost. If price is below
average cost, the firm loses money on every unit that it sells. It cannot continue to do this
in the long run. Hence, the firm will eventually shut down if price stays below average
cost. Whether this shutdown happens sooner or later will depend on the relation between
price and average variable cost, _AVC(q)_ . If price exceeds average variable cost, the firm
will continue to operate in the short run. If price is above average variable cost, the firm
can make some operating profit on each unit that it sells and this provides funds to cover at
least some of its fixed cost. However, if price is below average variable cost, then the firm
will simply shut down immediately.

Consideration of price and average cost also allows us to identify the role played by
sunk cost in the firm’s decision-making. Again, profit per unit in any period is simply price
less average cost, _P_ - _AC(q)_ . Total profit in any period is just the profit per unit times the
number of units, [ _P_ - _AC(q)_ ] _q_ . Before entering an industry, a firm must expect at least to
break even. If entry incurs a sunk cost, such as a licensing fee or research expense, then the
firm will have to believe that it will earn enough profit in subsequent periods to cover that
initial sunk cost. Otherwise, it will not enter the market. Formally, the discounted present
value of the expected future profits must be at least as great as the sunk cost of entry. Note
though, that once it has entered, the sunk cost is no longer relevant. Once the entry decision
has been made and the sunk cost incurred, the best that the firm can do is to follow the
prescription above: produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost so long as in
the short run price is greater than average variable cost, otherwise shut down. In the long
run, produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost so long as price is greater than
average cost, otherwise exit. Sunk cost affects the entry decision—not the decision on how
much to produce after entry has occurred nor the decision to exit.

In sum, the concept of average cost is relevant to whether the firm will produce positive
output in the long run, and the concept of average variable cost is relevant to whether the
firm will produce positive output in the short run. The concept of marginal cost is relevant to
how much output the firm will produce given that it chooses to produce a positive amount.
Sunk cost is relevant to the decision to enter the market in the first place.


4.1.3 Costs and Market Structure


Closer consideration of Figure 4.1 reveals an important relationship between average and
marginal costs. Note that when marginal cost is less than average cost, as at output _q_ 1, an
expansion of output will lead to a reduction in average cost. Conversely, when marginal
cost is greater than average cost, an expansion of output will lead to an increase in average
cost. In the figure, marginal cost is less than average cost for all outputs less than _q_ [∗], the
range through which average cost constantly falls. Conversely, marginal cost is greater than
average cost for outputs greater than _q_ [∗], the range through which average cost constantly
rises. This feature is true for all cost functions. Average cost falls whenever marginal cost
is less than average cost, and rises whenever marginal cost exceeds average cost. It follows
immediately that marginal cost and average cost are equal when average cost is minimized.

The basic cost relationships are illustrated with a hypothetical example in Table 4.1 (the
parameter _S_ in this table is explained below). This table provides measures of total, average,
and marginal cost data for an imaginary firm. [4] The table documents the point made above
that average cost falls when it lies above marginal cost, rises when it is below marginal cost,
and (because the numbers are a discrete approximation) is essentially equal to marginal
cost at the minimum average cost value. The Appendix to this chapter presents a formal
derivation of cost measures and cost functions.

As noted above, firms have to expect to break even in order for production to be profitable.
This means that both average cost and sunk cost play a role in determining market structure.
We consider average cost first.

When average cost falls as output increases, it means that the cost per unit of output
declines as the scale of operations rises. It is natural to describe this state of affairs as one in
which there are economies of scale. If, however, unit costs rise as production increases, we
say that there are diseconomies of scale. Fundamentally, the presence of scale economies or
scale diseconomies reflects the underlying technology. Some factors of production simply
cannot be scaled down to small levels of production. For example, provision of passenger
rail service between Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, will require approximately sixty miles
of track whether the number of trains per day is one or twenty. As a result, a passenger train
firm renting the track from the freight company that currently owns it will have to pay the
same rent whether it has many passengers or just a few.

Yet it is not just the presence of large fixed costs that gives rise to scale economies.
For many productive processes, there are efficiencies that come about just as a result of
being larger. To begin with, size permits a greater division of labor, as Adam Smith noted
over 200 years ago. [5] This in turn permits specialization and more efficient production.
Sometimes, the simple mathematics of the activity give rise to important scale effects. It
is well known, for example, that the cost of a container will rise roughly in proportion
to its surface area (essentially, the radius squared), whereas its capacity rises roughly in
proportion to its volume (essentially, the radius cubed). Thus, while a 10x10x10 cube will
hold 1,000 cubic feet, a 20x20x20 cube holds 8,000 cubic feet. Because the cost in terms
of materials and labor depends on surface area but output depends on volume, it follows


4 In Table 4.1, marginal cost is calculated as the average of the increase in cost associated with producing
one unit more and the decrease in cost associated with producing one unit less.
5 Smith’s classic, _The Wealth of Nations_, includes a famous chapter on the division of labor and the
productivity enhancement that this yielded at a pin factory.


70 Foundations


that as container size increases there is a less-than-proportional rise in the cost. In turn,
this implies that unit cost declines as output increases. Specifically, unit cost will fall by
about 3 percent for every 10 percent increase in output. [6] For a variety of processes, such
as distributing natural gas via a pipeline or manufacturing glass products in which molten
glass is kept in large ovens, this relationship suggests that it will be less expensive per unit
to operate at a large volume. [7]

Whatever the source of the scale economies, the fact that scale economies are indicated
by a falling average cost gives us a precise way to measure their presence. For we know
that a declining average cost can only be observed if marginal cost is below average cost.
Likewise, the presence of scale diseconomies or rising average cost requires that marginal
cost be above average cost. Hence, we can construct a precise index of the extent of scale
economies by defining the measure _S_ to be the ratio of average to marginal cost. That is:




_[AC][(][q][)]_ [[] _[C][(][q][)]_ [ +] _[ F]_ []] _[/][q]_

_MC(q)_ _MC(q)_

[=]



_S_ _[AC][(][q][)]_
= _MC(q_




_[q][)]_ [ +] _[ F]_ []] _[/][q]_ _[C][(][q][)]_ [ +] _[ F]_

_MC(q)_ = _qMC(q)_



(4.2)
_qMC(q)_



The more that _S_ exceeds 1, the greater is the extent of scale economies. In such a setting,
a 1 percent increase in output is associated with a less than 1 percent increase in costs.
Conversely, when _S <_ 1, diseconomies of scale are present. Increasing output by 1 percent
now leads to more than a 1 percent increase in costs. Finally, when _S_ = 1, neither economies
nor diseconomies of scale are present. In this case, we say that the production technology
exhibits constant returns to scale.

We define _minimum efficient scale_ as the lowest level of output at which economies of
scale are exhausted or, in other words, at which _S_ = 1. In Figure 4.1 the minimum efficient
scale is _q_ [∗] .

In Table 4.1, we can approximate the value of _S_ at _q_ = 6 as follows. The addition to
total cost of increasing output from 6 to 7 is $101. The reduction in total cost of decreasing
_q_ by one unit is $91. So, an approximate measure of marginal cost at exactly _q_ = 6 is
the mean of these two numbers, or $96. Average cost at _q_ = 6 is $136. Accordingly,
_S_ = 136 _/_ 96 = 1.42. _S_ can also be estimated by dividing the percentage increase in total
output by the percentage increase in total cost. For example, when output is increased from
6 to 7, the percentage increase is given by:


1
6

[×][ 100%][ =][ 16.67%]

Meanwhile, this output rise induces a percentage increase in total cost of:


917 816
   - 100% 12.37%

816 × =

The ratio of these two percentages is then 16.67% _/_ 12.37% = 1.35%. This is not far
from the measure of _S (_ = 1.42 _)_ that we obtained using the ratio of average to marginal

6 The classic study by Chenery (1949) on natural gas pipelines is an example of this technical relationship.
7 The technical explanations given here reflect the shortcomings of the neoclassical approach in that they
do not make clear why the scale economies associated with a specific production technology must be
exploited within a single firm. For example, two or more firms can own pipelines jointly. Indeed, there is
growing support for the use of co-ownership, or cotenancy, as an alternative to direct regulation in the case
of natural monopoly. See Gale (1994).


Technology and Cost 71


cost. Indeed, if we could vary production more continuously and so consider the cost of
producing 6.5 units, or 6.25 units, and so on, the two measures would be equal.

The ratio of the percentage change in total cost with respect to the percentage change in
output is called the elasticity of cost with respect to output. What we have just shown is
that the inverse of this ratio—the percentage change in output divided by the percentage
change in cost—is a good indicator of scale economies. In other words, _S_ measures the
proportionate increase in output one obtains for a given proportionate increase in costs.


How is the behavior of average cost or the extent of scale economies related to industry
structure? Going back to Figure 4.1, we see that _S >_ 1 for any level of output less than _q_ [∗] .
Scale economies are present at every output level in this range. By contrast, _S <_ 1 for all
outputs greater than _q_ [∗] . Now suppose that we have other information indicating that demand
conditions are such that the maximum extent of the market is less than _q_ [∗] even if price falls
to zero. We can then state that scale economies are present throughout the relevant range of
production. Put another way, economies of scale are global in such a market.

If scale economies are global then the market is a natural monopoly. The term “natural”
is meant to reflect the implication that monopoly is an (almost) inevitable outcome for this
market because it is cheaper in such cases for a single firm to supply the entire market than
for two or more firms to do so. For example, the least expensive way to produce the quantity
_q_ [∗] in Figure 4.1 is to have one firm produce the entire amount. If instead, two firms divided
this production equally so that each produces an output _q_ 1 _q_ [∗] _/_ 2, each of these two firms
would have higher average costs than would the single firm producing = _q_ [∗] .

The role of scale economies in determining market structure should now be clear. If scale
economies are global, there will be no more than one firm in an efficient market. Even if
they are not global but simply quite large, efficiency may still require that all the production
be done in one firm. More generally, the greater the extent of scale economies—the larger
the output at which average cost is minimized—the fewer are the firms that can operate efficiently in the market. Thus, large scale economies will tend to result in concentrated markets.


a. Derive an expression for average cost. Plot the value of average cost for _q_ = 4,
_q_ = 8 _, q_ = 10 _, q_ = 12 _,_ and _q_ = 15.
b. Marginal cost can be approximated by the rise in cost, _�C_, that occurs when output
increases by one unit, _�q_ = 1. However, it can also be approximated by the fall in
cost that occurs when output is decreased by one unit, _�q_ = −1. Because these two
measures will not be quite the same, we often use their average. Show that for the
above cost relation, this procedure produces an estimate of marginal cost equal to
_MC_ = 2 + _q_ .
c. Compute the index of scale economies, _S_ . For what values of _q_ is it the case that
_S >_ 1 _, S_ = 1 _,_ and _S <_ 1?

4.2 SUNK COST AND MARKET STRUCTURE


Sunk costs also play a role in influencing market structure in a way that is conceptually
similar to the role of scale economies. Again, firms only enter a market if they believe that
they can at least break even. This means that if there are positive sunk costs associated with
entry, then firms must earn positive profits in each subsequent period of actual operation
to cover those entry costs. If this is the case, entry will occur. This view leads naturally to
a definition of long-run equilibrium. Firms will stop entering the industry—and therefore
the number of firms will be at its equilibrium level—when the profit from operating each
period just covers the initial sunk cost that entry requires.


Technology and Cost 73


The foregoing logic permits us to see clearly the role of sunk cost in determining market
structure. Imagine for example a market in which each firm produces an identical good and
in which the elasticity of demand is exactly one, or _η_ = 1, throughout the demand curve.
This means that the total consumer expenditure for the product is constant because a 1
percent decrease in price is balanced by a 1 percent increase in quantity sold. Denote then
this constant total expenditure as _E_ . If _P_ is the market price and _Q_ is total market output,
we then have: _E_ _PQ_ . However, total output _Q_ is also equal to the output of each firm _qi_
=
times the number of firms, _N_, that is, _Q_ _Nqi_ . Putting these two relationships together we
=
then obtain:


_qi_ _E/NP_ (4.3)
=

Now recall the Lerner Index that was discussed in Chapter 3. If we assume that all firms are
identical and that each has a constant marginal (and average) production cost _c_, then this
index _LI_ is given by: _(P_ - _c)/P_ . Because this index is a measure of the extent of monopoly
power in the industry, it is natural to assume that it declines as the number of firms, _N_,
gets larger. We formalize this idea by assuming that the industry Lerner Index is negatively
related to the number of firms _N_ as follows:


_(P_  - _c)/P_ = _A/N_ _[α]_ (4.4)

where _A_ and _α_ are both arbitrary positive constants. Finally, let’s assume that firms only
operate one period so that to break even requires that: _(P_ _c)qi_ _F_, where _F_ is the sunk
entry cost. [8] Substituting this break-even requirement into equation (4.3) and combining that − =
equation with equation (4.4) then yields that the equilibrium number of firms _N_ _[e]_ at which
each entrant just covers its sunk entry cost _F_, is given by:



(4.5)




- 1

~~1+~~ _α_



_N_ _[e]_ =




_AE_

_F_



Clearly, _N_ _[e]_ declines as _F_ rises. While the precise results of equation (4.5) reflect the
particular assumptions made for our example, the intuition underlying those results is fairly
general. Industry structure is likely to be more concentrated in markets where sunk entry
costs are a high proportion of consumer expenditures.


4.3 COSTS AND MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS


Because scale economies are a description of the behavior of costs as output increases,
investigating their existence in any industry requires that we measure the output of the
firms in that industry. This is not always so easy. Consider, for instance, the case of a
railroad. One possible measure of output is the rail ton-mile, defined as the number of tons
transported times the average number of miles each ton travels. However, not all railroads
carry the same type of freight. Some carry mainly mining and forestry products, some
carry manufactured goods, and some carry agricultural products. In addition, through the
first half of this century, many private US railroads carried passengers as well as freight.


8 Alternatively, we could assume that _F_ is the annualized value of the sunk entry costs.


74 Foundations


Elsewhere in the world, this is still the case. Because all of these different kinds of services
have different carrying costs, aggregating each railroad’s output into a simple measure such
as total ton-miles will confuse any cost analysis. Such aggregation does not allow us to
identify whether cost differences between railroads are due to differences in scale or to
differences in the kinds of transport being provided.

The railroad example points to a gap in our analysis of the firm. In particular, it implies
the need to extend the analysis to cover firms producing more than one type of good,
that is, to investigate costs for multiproduct firms. This need is perhaps more important
today than ever before. Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2009), for example, find that 39
percent of US manufacturing firms produce more than one major product and that these
firms account for 87 percent of total US production. Thus, the major automobile firms
also produce trucks and buses. Microsoft produces both the _Windows_ operating systems
and several applications written for that system. Consumer electronics firms produce TVs,
stereos, game consoles, and so on. Measuring the total output of these firms in a single index
is clearly less than straightforward. If we are to use the technological approach to the firm
to gain some understanding of industry structure, we clearly need to extend that approach
to handle multiproduct companies. In other words, we need to develop an analysis of costs
for the multiproduct firm. The question then becomes whether we can derive average cost
and scale economy measures for multiproduct firms that are as precise and clear as the
analogous concepts developed for the single product case.


4.3.1 Multiproduct Scale and Scope Economies


The answer to the foregoing question is that, subject to some restrictions, yes we can. This
is one of the major contributions of Baumol, Panzar, and Willig (1982). These authors show
that the restriction is simply that we measure average cost for a given mix of products,
say two units of freight service for every one unit of passenger service in the railroad
case. We can then measure average cost at any production level so long as we keep these
proportions constant. This is what Baumol, Panzar, and Willig (1982) call Ray Average
Cost (RAC). They further show that we can derive a measure of scale economies based on
the RAC measure that is conceptually quite similar to the scale economies measure for the
single-product case.

To understand the basic idea of Ray Average Cost, consider a firm with two products, _q_ 1
and _q_ 2. Let us imagine that these two products may be combined to create a composite good
called _q_ _q_ 1 _q_ 2. However, this composite good will be different depending on how much
of each good we have. A composite good made up of one unit of product 1 and five units of = +
product 2 is very different from one comprised of three units of product 1 and one unit of
product 2. Because we want to consider costs for a specific product, we choose a production
ray along which the two goods are always produced in the same proportion. A possible
production ray, for example, is one in which the production of good 1 is always twice that
of good 2, that is, _q_ 1 2 _q_ 2. Now we can consider the behavior of costs for all output levels
in which this proportion is maintained—for = _q_ 1 2 and _q_ 2 1 _q_ 1 20 and _q_ 2 10; and
so on. By focusing on a specific production ray, we isolate the change in cost that is due = = ; = =
only to changing the level of output and not that due to changes in the product mix.

Continuing with our example, suppose that _q_ 1 60 so that _q_ 2 30. Then it follows
that _q_ _q_ 1 _q_ 2 90. Note that we could write this alternatively as = = _q_ 1 _(_ 60 _/_ 90 _)q_ and
_q_ 2 _(_ =30 _/_ 90 + _)q_ . More generally, for a given product mix or production ray, we can write = =
_q_ 1 = _λq_ and _q_ 2 _(_ 1 _λ)q_, where _λ/(_ 1 _λ)_ is the fixed proportions of the product mix
= =  -

along the production ray being considered. In our example, _λ_ = 2 _/_ 3 and 1 − _λ_ = 1 _/_ 3, so
that _λ/(_ 1 − _λ)_ = 2.

We denote the total cost of producing both products at any level as _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_
+
_F_ = _C_ [ _λq, (_ 1 − _λ)q_ ] + _F_ = _C(q)_ + _F_ . We denote the marginal cost of goods 1 and 2,
respectively, as _MC_ 1 and _MC_ 2. Recall that for the single product case, our scale economy
measure was the ratio of average cost to marginal cost [equation (4.2)]. Analogously, we
define a measure of multi-product (in our case, two-product) scale economies as:



_S_ _[M]_ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ + _F_
= _q_ 1 _MC_ 1 _q_ 2 _MC_ 2
+



(4.6)



Having an explicit definition for scale economies in the multiproduct case is, as we shall
see, very helpful. Perhaps a more important insight of Baumol, Panzar, and Willig (1982),
however, is their introduction of an equally critical measure called economies of _scope_ .
Economies of scope are said to be present whenever it is less costly to produce a set of
goods in one firm than it is to produce that set in two or more firms. Let the total cost
of producing two goods, _q_ 1 and _q_ 2, be given by _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ + _F_ . For the two-product case,
scope economies exist if _C(q_ 1 _,_ 0 _)_ _F_ 1 _C(_ 0 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ 2 [ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ ] _>_ 0. The first
two terms in this equation are the total costs of producing product 1—the variable costs + + + - +
associated with just this one good plus the fixed cost if only this good is produced. The
next two terms are the analogous cost measures when only good 2 is produced. The last
terms are of course the total cost of having these products produced by the same firm. If the
difference is positive, then scope economies exist. If it is negative, there are diseconomies
of scope. If it is 0, then there are neither economies nor diseconomies of scope. The degree
of such economies _S_ _[C]_ is defined by the ratio:


_S_ _[C]_ _[C][(][q]_ [1] _[,]_ [ 0] _[)]_ [ +] _[ F]_ [1][ +] _[ C][(]_ [0] _[,][ q]_ [2] _[)]_ [ +] _[ F]_ [2][ −] [[] _[C][(][q]_ [1] _[,][ q]_ [2] _[)]_ [ +] _[ F]_ []] (4.7)
= _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_

+

The concept of scope economies is a crucial one that provides the central technological
reason for the existence of multiproduct firms. Such economies can arise for two main
reasons. The first of these is that particular outputs share common inputs. This is the source
of economies of scope in the railroad example where the common input is the track. Another
example would include a firm’s advertising expenditures that benefit all of the products
carrying that same brand name.

An alternative source of scope economies is the presence of cost complementarities. Cost
complementarities occur when producing more of one good lowers the cost of producing
a second good. There are numerous ways in which such interactions can take place. For
example, the exploration and drilling of an oil well often yields not just oil but also natural
gas. Hence, engaging in crude oil production will likely lower the cost of gas exploration.
Similarly, a firm that manufactures computer software may also find it easy to provide
computer-consulting services.

Scope economies have likely become stronger in recentdecades following the introduction
of new manufacturing techniques, referred to as flexible manufacturing systems. They can
be defined as “production unit(s) capable of producing a range of discrete products with a
minimum of manual intervention” (U.S. Office of Technology Assessment, 1984, p. 60).
The idea here is that production processes should be capable of switching easily from one
variant of a product to another without a significant cost penalty.

Consider, for example, the popular clothing manufacturer, Benetton. This Italian family
firm has over 2,500 retail outlets around the globe. Each is equipped with special cash
registers that collect and transmit information regarding which items are selling, and
in what colors, sizes, and styles. This information is sent to the central manufacturing
facilities. These, together with numerous small sub-contracting firms, then respond quickly


Technology and Cost 77


to these market signals. Benetton’s famous coloring is the final step of the process, as the
dyeing of the goods is done at the last moment just before shipment to the stores. All of
this is made possible via Benetton’s extensive use of computer-assisted-design/computerassisted-manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology, which allows it to produce a wide array
of differentiated (by color) products.


4.3.2 Different Products versus Different Versions


So far, our discussion of multiproduct firms has not distinguished between situations in
which the two outputs are somewhat related, as is the case with passenger and freight rail
service, and those in which the two goods are substantially different products, say cologne
and shirts. In the latter case, the two products use quite different production processes and
the presence of scope economies seems less compelling. It seems more likely that scope
economies will be found when the goods being produced use similar production techniques
because then we are more likely to find shared inputs and cost complementarities.

An issue that arises in this regard is the distinction between different goods and different
versions of the same good. Campbell’s produces both canned soup and canned beverages,
principally, _V_ 8. While this may reflect some scope effects, the real source of scope
economies at Campbell’s is undoubtedly the fact that it is cheaper to manufacture of
Campbell’s thirty-plus types of canned soup at one firm rather than having over thirty
separate firms each producing one of those varieties. Likewise, there are almost certainly
some strong scope economies at work that lead L’Oreal to offer over more than fifty shades
of its _Riche Lipstick_, as well as offering other cosmetics, including lipsticks, through its
subsidiaries, Maybelline and Lancˆome.

Because firms so often market multiple varieties within a product category as well as
possibly marketing more than one distinct good, it is useful to have a way of modeling
markets in which the basic good is sold in many differentiated versions. One way to do
this is to imagine that some particular characteristic is the critical distinguishing feature
between different versions of the good. In the case of cars, this characteristic could be
speed or acceleration. In the case of soft drinks, it could be sugar content. We can then
construct an index to measure this feature. Each point on the index, ranging from low to
high acceleration capacity, low to high sugar content, and so on, represents a different
product variety. Some consumers will prefer a car that accelerates rapidly or a very sweet
beverage, while others will favor cars that are easier to drive because they are capable of
less acceleration or beverages with very low sugar content.

As an example, imagine a soft-drink company considering the marketing of three versions
of its basic cola: (1) Diet or sugar free; (2) Super, with full sugar content; and (3) LX,
an intermediate cola with just half the sugar content of Super. In this case, the distinctive
feature separating each product type is sugar content, and thus we want to construct an
index of such content. It is customary to normalize such an index so that it ranges from 0
to 1. The spectrum of products for our imaginary company, therefore, ranges from Diet,
located at point 0 on our index, to Super, located at point 1, with LX positioned, let’s say,
squarely in the middle at point 0.5. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2.

The spectrum shown in Figure 4.2 may be alternatively interpreted as a street. In turn, we
may regard consumers as being located at different “addresses” on this street. Consumers
who really like sugar will have addresses close to the Super product line. In contrast,
consumers who really need to watch their calorie intake will have addresses near the Diet
product line. Similarly, consumers who favor more than a medium amount of sugar but

not quite so much as that contained in the Super variety will have addresses somewhere
between the LX and Super points.

If scope economies exist, firms have a strong incentive to exploit them. If we extend this
logic to the case of multiple varieties within a product category, then the implication is that
firms in such markets ought to produce a wide range of product types. This logic has been
formalized by Eaton and Schmitt (1994). These authors present a formal model of flexible
manufacturing in which there are _k_ possible versions of the good. They show that when
scope economies are very strong, it will be natural for each firm in the industry to produce
the entire range of _k_ products.

The same incentive applies of course to scope economies across truly different product
categories. Indeed, a critical insight of the analysis of multiproduct production is that it is the
presence of _scope_ economies as identified by equation (4.7) that makes it possible to exploit
the multiproduct _scale_ economies identified by equation (4.6). The airline industry offers
another good example. For many years, major air carriers have organized their services
around the hub-and-spoke system. Under this system, central large airports, designated as
hubs, act as collector stations. Hub-to-hub flights are typically served by large aircraft for
which the cost per passenger mile is low when they are filled to near capacity. Spoke
airports, in contrast, serve as “feeders” that use relatively small aircraft to fly passengers
from many different locations to a hub where they can all be collected and put on hub-to-hub
flights to generate the passenger volume necessary to exploit the efficiencies of the larger
aircraft. The multi-product scale economies can thus only be realized by operating in both
the spoke and the hub markets.

Overall then, significant scope economies lead to more concentrated market structures
in two ways. First, the scope effects by definition create incentives to consolidate the
production of different products and different product versions within one firm rather
than many separate firms. Second, strong scope economies also give rise to important
multiproduct scale economies, leading firms to be large relative to market size. [9]


4.4 LEARNING-BY-DOING AND EXPERIENCE CURVES


Scale economies reflect the lower unit cost that comes from operating on a larger scale as
defined by the volume of production per unit of time. If there are significant scale economies
in automobile production, then General Motors will have a lower unit cost in 2013 if it
produces say 3.8 million cars that year instead of 3.4 million. There is, however, another
size factor that may influence a firm’s cost. This is its total, cumulative output over its entire


9 See Panzar (1989) for a good discussion of cost issues in general. See Evans and Heckman (1986) and
Roller (1990) for evidence of scope economies in the telephone industry; Cohn, Rhine, and Santos (1989)
and DeGroot, McMahon, and Volkwein (1991) for evidence of scope economies in higher education;
and Gilligan, Smirlock, and Marshall (1984) and Pulley and Braunstein (1992) for evidence of scope
economies in finance.

history. If this factor is important, then a firm that produces only 3.4 million cars might still
have relatively low unit cost if it has produced a lot of cars in previous years.

Like any organization, firms and their employees can learn with experience. There are
typically many ways of organizing design, production, and sales, and the best ways can only
be learned by trial-and-error. As the cumulative experience of the firm grows, more such
trials can be made and the insights from that experience can be used to raise productivity in
the future. Based on a survey of the then-existing literature, Argote and Epple (1990) find
that for the typical US manufacturing firm, labor costs fall by 20 percent as its cumulative
output doubles. Ramanarayanan (2006) finds that for cardiac surgeons, each additional
coronary artery bypass performed lowers the probability of death for subsequent patients
by 0.14 percent. These results imply that cost reductions due to organizational learning are
important, as illustrated by Figure 4.3.

Yet if organizations can learn, they can also forget. As older workers retire or quit and
institutional memories are lost, firms may move backwards and unit costs may rise. Benkard
(2000, 2004) finds evidence of both learning and forgetting in aircraft production. As firms
learn and forget, the dynamics of industry structure become complicated.

However, the basic intuition regarding how important learning effects may affect
market structure is relatively straightforward. Essentially, learning-by-doing leads to more
concentrated market structures because it provides further advantage to first movers or
early entrant firms, as these firms will typically have had the longest time to learn.
Strategic considerations are likely to reinforce this result. Faced with possible new rivals,
an incumbent firm will often find it optimal to price artificially low so as to sell more units.
This not only helps the incumbent move down the learning curve itself but also makes
it harder for rivals to do the same. Further, the prospect that whatever it learns may be
forgotten gives a further incentive for the incumbent to price low and thereby acquire more
experiences so that even if it loses some of its knowledge, it still has an advantage. Thus,
both in and of itself and because of the strategic responses it induces, learning-by-doing
will likely lead to more concentrated markets in which early incumbents maintain and even
extend their dominance. [10]

4.5 NON-COST DETERMINANTS OF INDUSTRY STRUCTURE


So far, we have focused on the role of cost relationships, especially scale and scope
economies, as being the main determinants of firm size and industry structure. There are,
however, other factors that can play an important role. Here, we mention three factors
specifically. These are: 1) the size of the market, 2) the presence of network externalities
on the demand side, and 3) the role of government policy.


4.5.1 Market Size and Competitive Industry


The influence of market size on industry structure has been extensively investigated by
Sutton (1991, 2001). The fact that a firm must be large to reach the minimum efficient
scale of operations does not necessarily imply a highly concentrated structure if the market
in question is large enough to accommodate many such firms. Similarly, the fact that it
is cheaper to produce many different products (or many versions of the same product) in
one firm rather than in several firms does not necessarily imply a market dominated by a
few firms. Most farms produce more than one crop. Yet farming is a very competitively
structured industry in part because the market for agricultural products is so extensive.

Just how big does a market have to be in order to avoid domination by a few firms?
The answer is: it depends. When scale economies are extensive, for example when sunk or
fixed costs associated with indivisible inputs are relatively large, the market will need to be
greater to accommodate more firms. Thus, the relationship between market structure and
market size will vary according to the specific market being examined.

If scale economies are exhausted at some point and if sunk entry costs do not rise with
the size of the market, then we ought to see that concentration declines as market size
grows sufficiently large. Some direct evidence of this effect is provided by Bresnahan and
Reiss (1991). They gathered data on a number of professions and services from over 200
towns scattered across the western United States. They find that a town of about 800 or
900 will support just one doctor. As the town grows to a population of roughly 3,500,
a second doctor will typically enter. It takes a town of over 9,000 people to generate an
industry of five doctors. The same positive relationship between market size and the number
of firms is also found in other professions. For tire dealers, for example, Bresnahan and
Reiss find that a town of only 500 people is needed to support one tire dealer and that five
tire dealers will emerge when the town reaches a population of 6,000. The smaller market
requirements needed to support a given number of tire dealers instead of doctors probably
reflects, among other things, the fact that doctors have higher fixed/sunk costs than do the
tire dealers.

Sutton (1991, 2001) however, provides an important qualification to the idea that
concentration will decline with the size of the market. He notes that such a relationship does
not appear to hold in a number of industries, particularly in industries that compete heavily
using either advertising, such as processed foods, or R&D, such as pharmaceuticals. Sutton
argues that these expenditures are not only sunk but also endogenous. They are sunk in that
once the expenditures for a promotional campaign or product design have been incurred,
they cannot be recovered. They are endogenous in that in these kinds of industries, sunk
cost _F_ is not fixed but in fact increases as the market size grows.

The logic of the Sutton argument can be seen by focusing on the sunk entry cost term
_F_ in equation (4.5). Assume that this term reflects advertising and/or R&D expenditures.
However, rather than simply assuming that such expenditures are equal to some exogenous


Technology and Cost 81


level _F_, assume instead that they are related to market size. For example, we may assume a
linear relationship of the form:


_F_ = _K_ + _β(AE)_ (4.8)


where recall that _A_ is a constant ( _K_ is also a constant) and _E_ is aggregate consumer
expenditure in the industry.

Using (4.8), equation (4.5) now may be written as:







1

~~�~~ ~~�~~
_K_



(4.9)



_N_ _[e]_ =



~~_AE_~~




~~�~~



+ _β_




- 1
~~1+~~ _α_



Equation (4.9) says that the equilibrium number of firms in the industry will grow as
market size _AE_ grows but that this process has an asymptotic limit. Specifically, the number
of firms will never exceed _(_ 1 _/β)_ [1] _[/(]_ [1][+] _[α)]_ no matter how large the market gets. For example,
suppose that _α_ = 1 and _β_ = 0.0625. If this is the case, then the equilibrium number of firms
in the industry will never exceed four, regardless of market size. [11]

Somewhat similarly, our initial derivation of equation (4.5) assumed that price cost
margins declined as a result of an increase in the number of firms as described by:
_(P_ - _c)/P_ = _A/N_ _[a]_ . However, there may be systematic differences between industries in
the relationship between the price cost margin and the population of firms. In particular,
markets in which firms sell a homogenous product and in which they can quickly alter
production to meet demand may have very small price cost margins. This is because in
such homogenous good markets, the firm with the lowest price gets all the customers,
especially if it can readily adjust output to meet that demand. Algebraically, this means that
the parameter _α_ above will differ across markets. It will be larger in those markets in which
competition is naturally more intense. In such markets, the equilibrium number of firms
will be correspondingly smaller.


4.5.2 Network Externalities and Market Structure


It is not news to anyone reading this book that Microsoft’s _Windows_ has an approximate
85 percent of the operating systems market for desktop and laptop computers with virtually
all of the remaining 15 percent going to Apple’s _Mac_ products. [12] _Microsoft Word_ and
_Microsoft Excel_ have similarly large, dominant market shares of the word-processing and
spreadsheet markets, respectively. Scale and scope economies are undoubtedly part of the
explanation for the highly concentrated nature of these markets. Once the costs have been
sunk to design the basic program for the operating systems or application software, the cost
of reproducing the product many times over is quite trivial. It is also highly likely that there
will be a large common component to these design costs. However, as many witnesses
testified at the Microsoft antitrust case of 1999–2000, an additional critical factor behind
Microsoft’s dominance is the presence of _network externalities_ . Such network effects reflect
the fact that for some products, a consumer’s willingness to pay for a good or service
increases as the number of other consumers buying the product rises.


11 See Baldwin (1995) for some evidence on this point.
12 www.statowl.com/operating_system_market_share.php.


82 Foundations


Network effects can be _direct_ or _indirect_ . Telephone service exhibits direct network
externalities. The usefulness or value of a single consumer connecting to a telephone system
is essentially nil. Yet, as more people sign on to the system, the number of potential calls and
hence the utility of owning a phone increases as well. Operating systems, platforms such as
Amazon’s _Kindle_, and credit card services each exhibit more indirect network effects due
to complementarities with other products. In the case of operating systems, for example,
the significant scale economies that characterize the design and production of applications
means that firms marketing computer apps want to make them compatible with as large a
network as possible. Likewise, consumers want to use an operating system for which the
number of available applications is largest. This establishes a positive feedback loop. As
_Windows_ ’ market share grows, more applications firms will want to design their applications
to run on the _Windows_ operating system. As more applications are written for _Windows_,
demand for the _Windows_ system rises and with it, _Windows_ ’ market share. Likewise as
more books are offered on _Kindle_ and as more retailers accept _American Express_ cards, the
more consumers want to use _Kindle_ readers and _Amex_ credit cards, which in turn, increases
the market shares of these firms.

We address the topic of network externalities more extensively in Chapter 22. However,
from the brief discussion above, it should be relatively easy to see that markets with
important network externalities are likely to be ones populated by a few very large firms. In
other words, they are likely to have a highly concentrated structure—even if scale economies
are not present on the cost side. Indeed, many analysts view network externalities as a case
of scale economies that exist on the demand side of the market.


4.5.3 The Role of Government Policy


From 1934 to the mid 1990s, the number of medallions authorizing legal ownership of a
taxicab in Boston was fixed at 1,525. Not a single additional medallion was issued in all that
time despite the fact that the regional population increased by over 50 percent and the level
of income and economic activity doubled several times over. Costs and technology were
not the source of this fixed industrial structure. The primary reason for the limited entry
into the Boston taxi industry was government policy. City and state officials deliberately
limited the number of taxi medallions, largely to the benefit of those lucky taxi owners who
obtained the first batch of medallions. A court order in the mid-1990s led to an increase of
nearly 300 medallions over the subsequent five years. Yet this was not enough to keep the
price of medallion from rising dramatically. [13]

A similar phenomenon prevailed from the 1930s through the 1970s when the number of
so-called trunk airlines flying interstate routes never exceeded sixteen and fell to ten by the
end of the 70s. Not only was the total number of airlines small on a national scale, it was even
smaller for individual city-pair markets. Many of these were often served by only one or
two carriers. Here again, the primary cause was government policy. In this case, that policy
was implemented by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the federal agency established
in 1938 as the economic regulator of the airline industry. Throughout its existence, the
CAB deliberately limited entry and sustained a high concentration level in the US domestic
airline industry. Indeed, this forty-year period witnessed numerous applications by freight
and charter airlines to be granted the right to offer scheduled passenger services, as well
as frequent applications of existing airlinesto enter new city-pair markets. Virtually all

Technology and Cost 83


of these requests were turned down. The CAB argued that this policy was necessary to
promote the stability and healthy development of the airline industry. Whether it achieved
its perceived goals, and whether such goals were appropriate, are questions to be answered
elsewhere. The central point illustrated by both the taxicab and airline examples is that
explicit government policies often play an important role in determining market structure.

More often than not, the role of government policy has been to increase market
concentration as both of the examples above illustrate. However, some government policies
do work to increase the number of firms in an industry. The Robinson-Patman Act that
prohibits price discounts to large firms if such discounts are deemed anticompetitive reflects
a conscious effort to keep independent retailers in business. These are typically small firms
that otherwise would have been driven out of the market by the large retail chains. Similarly,
the decision of the US government after World War II to force the Alcoa Company to sell
some of its wartime aluminum plants to the Kaiser and Reynolds corporations was clearly
an effort to promote a more competitive structure. Perhaps most obviously, antitrust policies
that lead either the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department to block mergers
also increase the equilibrium number of firms in an industry.


4.6 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: SCALE AND SCOPE
ECONOMIES IN BANKING


Because the underlying technology and associated cost implications are central determinants
of industrial structure, economists have been interested in getting evidence on cost
relationships for a long time. Unfortunately, we rarely have direct evidence on the
production technology. Thus estimating firm cost functions can be a tricky business.
However, application of basic microeconomic theory can greatly facilitate the process.

The basic idea is clear enough. A profit-maximizing firm will choose inputs to produce a
given output level at the lowest cost given the set of input prices. For single product firms,
this will imply that cost is simply a function of its total output and the prices of its inputs
(See the Appendix for a formal derivation of this relationship). With a data set in which
these variables vary either across firms at a point in time or for the same firm at different
times (or both), we can estimate this relationship to measure how total costs vary with
output and, hence, to estimate the extent of any scale economies. For instance, with one
output _Q_, and two inputs, capital and labor, whose input prices are _r_ and _w_, respectively,
we might estimate the simple logarithmic relationship below:


ln _C_ = Constant + _δ_ 1 ln _r_ + _δ_ 2 ln _w_ + _δ_ 3 ln _Q_ (4.10)


In this case, the coefficient _δ_ 3 is a direct measure of the elasticity of total cost with respect
to output. Therefore, 1 _/δ_ 3 is a measure of single-product scale economies.

A very simple extension of equation (4.10) to handle a firm with two outputs, _q_ 1 and _q_ 2,
we might instead assume a cost function of the form:


ln _C_ = Constant + _δ_ 1 ln _r_ + _δ_ 2 ln _w_ + _δ_ 3 ln _q_ 1 + _δ_ 4 ln _q_ 2 + _δ_ 5 _(_ ln _q_ 1 _)(_ ln _q_ 2 _)_ (4.11)

Here, the final term allows for interaction between the two outputs and thus allows
for possible scope economies. A more complicated extension of equation (4.10) that is


84 Foundations


potentially consistent with a very large range of underlying production functions is the
translog cost function, which in this case is written as:



In _C_ = Constant + _δ_ 1 ln _r_ + _δ_ 2 ln _w_ + _δ_ 3 ln _q_ 1 + _δ_ 4 ln _q_ 2 + _δ_ 5 _(_ ln _q_ 1 _)(_ ln _q_ 2 _)_



_δ_ 6 _(_ ln _r)(_ ln _w)_ _δ_ 7 _(_ ln _r)_ [2] _δ_ 8 _(_ ln _w)_ [2] _δ_ 9 _(_ ln _q_ 1 _)_ [2] _δ_ 10 _(_ ln _q_ 2 _)_ [2]
+ + + + +



_δ_ 11 _(_ ln _r)(_ ln _q_ 1 _)_ _δ_ 12 _(_ ln _w)(_ ln _q_ 1 _)_ _δ_ 13 _(_ ln _r)(_ ln _q_ 2 _)_ _δ_ 14 _(_ ln _w)(_ ln _q_ 2 _)_ (4.12)
+ + + +



Note that equation (4.12) includes equations (4.11) and (4.10) as special cases.

Once the cost function parameters (the _δ_ s) have been estimated, it is straightforward,
in principle, to derive the scale economy and scope economy measures described in the
text. Christensen and Green (1976) use this approach to find important scale economies in
electricity generation, while also finding that most power-generating firms are sufficiently
large that these scale economies have been fully exploited. DeGroot, McMahon, and
Volkwein (1991) use this translog approach to model the cost structure of American
research universities, assuming three university outputs: 1) undergraduate education, 2)
graduate education, and 3) research. They find that for the product mix of the typical
university there were significant unexploited scale economies (declining Ray Average
Cost). However, this was not true for the less student-intensive product mix of the top
private schools for which they found little if any scale economies. They also found
significant scope economies between graduate and undergraduate education but, somewhat
surprisingly, no scope economies between graduate education and research.

Pulley and Braunstein (1992) apply this same approach to commercial banking firms
with one important modification. Consider again the two-output case. Remember that the
measure of scope economies in this case is [ _C(q_ 1 _,_ 0 _)_ _F_ 1 _C(_ 0 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ 2] [ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_
_F_ ] _/_ [ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ ]. It may turn out, however, that there are no firms in the sample that { + + + - +
} +
produce only one output. Thus, any estimates of scope economies will have to be based
on hypothetical cases for which there are no actual counterparts. For this reason, Pulley
and Braunstein (1992) introduce a measure of _quasi_ -scope economies. To understand this
concept, consider the two-variable case. While no firms may actually specialize completely
in one product, some may come relatively close by devoting 90 percent of their effort to a
single output and 10 percent to the remaining output. We might therefore consider the cost
disadvantage that these firms face as: [ _C(_ 0.9 _q_ 1 _,_ 0.1 _q_ 2 _)_ _F_ 1 _C(_ 0.1 _q_ 1 _,_ 0.9 _q_ 2 _)_ _F_ 2]

[ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ ] _/_ [ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ ]. More generally, if { _ε_ is the fraction devoted to the minor + + + + } +
activity, then Pulley and Braunstein (1992) define _quasi_ -scope economies in the two-output
case as:


quasi- _S_ _[C]_ [ _C((_ 1 _ε)q_ 1 _, εq_ 2 _)_ _F_ 1 _C(εq_ 1 _, (_ 1 _ε)q_ 2 _)_ _F_ 2]
= {         - + +         - +

[ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ ] _/_ [ _C(q_ 1 _, q_ 2 _)_ _F_ ] (4.13)

     - + } +

By using different values of _ε_, Pulley and Braunstein (1992) can infer a robust estimate of
the importance of scope effects in banking.

For this purpose, Pulley and Braunstein (1992) define four banking outputs. These are: 1)
demand deposits plus savings and small time deposits, 2) real estate loans, 3) commercial
and industrial loans, and 4) installment and credit card loans. Table 4.2 below shows some
of the (quasi) scope and scale estimates they obtain for different variations of the underlying
cost equation and different values of _ε_ .

|_ε_ = 0.10|0.23<br>(0.06)|0.18<br>(0.28)|

The Pulley and Braunstein (1992) estimates indicate that there are sizable and statistically
significant advantages of scope in US commercial banking. Combining all four activities in
one firm reduces costs by 15 to 23 percent relative to the costs of producing these outputs at
four separate and much more specialized banks. Statistically significant but relatively small
scale effects are also found. Very large banks save only about 5 percent in costs relative
to small ones—not trivial, but perhaps not enough to offset the bad effects of having large
banks with a lot of market power—and that may need to be bailed out by the government
if they are “too large to fail.”


**Summary**



This chapter has focused on technology, key
cost concepts, and the implications they have
for industrial structure. Scale economies tend
to increase market concentration. Economies of
scope have a similar effect of concentrating the
production of different products within a single
firm. Scope economies also typically give rise to
important multiproduct scale economies. This is
particularly the case when the various products
are not truly different goods but, instead, different
versions of the same goods. In such productdifferentiated markets, the presence of scope and
scale economies will again imply a more concentrated structure. A further cost-related factor
is captured by the experience or learning curve
that characterizes some industries, such as aircraft manufacturing. In such markets, firms learn
valuable, cost-saving techniques as their total
production over time rises. This too will tend to
result in somewhat concentrated markets as early
entrants have a cost advantage over later rivals
because these incumbents will be farther down
the learning curve.

Other factors influence market structure as
well. One of these is market size. Because a large



market has room for a number of firms, larger
markets tend to be less concentrated than smaller
ones. However, increasing market size does not
lead to less concentration in markets in which
sunk costs also increase with size. These are typically markets in which advertising or research
and development costs play a major role.

Another important determinant of market
structure comes from the demand side of the market in the form of network externalities. Network
externalities imply that the value of a product to
any one consumer increases as other consumers
use it. Such externalities act much like scale
economies on the demand side and they foster
increased market concentration.

Government policy is also a very important
determinant of market structure. Regulations
such as those long applied to local taxi markets and the airline industry typically reduce the
ability of new firms to enter the market. Antitrust
policy can raise the number of firms in a market
by blocking a proposed merger.

Careful application of economic theory can
generate clear implications for the statistical
measurement of cost relationships. Such work

has been extremely useful in identifying scale
and scope economies. For example, regression
analysis based on the theory of production costs
has found significant scope economies between
different banking activities but little evidence of


**Problems**

1. Let the cost function be _C_ = 100 + 4 _q_ +
4 _q_ [2] . Derive an expression for average cost.
Derive an expression for marginal cost. Is
there any range of production characterized
by scale economies? At what production
level are scale economies exhausted?


2. An urban rapid-transit line runs crowded
trains (200 passengers per car) at rush hours,
but nearly empty trains (10 passengers per
car) at off-peak hours. A management consultant argues that the cost of running a car
for one trip on this line is about $50 regardless of the number of passengers. Hence, the
consultant concludes that the per passenger
cost is about 25 cents at rush hour but rises
to $5 in off-peak hours. Consequently, the
consultant advises that it would be better to
discourage the off-peak business. Is the consultant a good economist? Why or why not?


3. Consider the following cost relationships
for a single-product firm:

_C(q)_ = 50 + 0.5 _q_ for _q_ ≤ 7

_C(q)_ = 7 _q_ for _q >_ 7
a. Derive average and marginal cost for
all integer outputs less than or equal to
7.
b. What are the average and marginal cost
for all outputs above 7?


4. In the problem above, is there a minimum
efficient scale of plant implied by these cost
relationships? If so, what is it?


5. Let _P_ be industry price and _Q_ be total industry output. If the industry demand curve is
_P_ = 84 − 0.5 _Q_, use the data in question 3
to determine what is the maximum number
of efficient-sized firms that the industry can
sustain.


6. How would your answer to question 5 be
changed if industry demand were instead
_P_ = 14 − 0.5 _Q_ ? Explain.



significant scale economies. Other studies have
found important scale effects in electric power
generation and important economies of scope
between graduate and undergraduate education.


7. Some estimates for the cement industry
suggest the following relationship between
capacity and average cost:


_Capacity_
_(Thousands of Tons)_ _Average Cost_


250 28.78
500 25.73
750 23.63
1,000 21.63
1,250 21.00
1,500 20.75
1,750 20.95
2,000 21.50


a. At what production level are scale
economies exhausted?
b. Calculate the scale economy index for
the production levels 500, 750, 1,000,
1,500, and 1,750.


8. A recent article (J. Peder Zane, “It Ain’t for
the Meat; It’s for Lotion,” _New York Times_,
Sunday May 5, 1996: E5) presented the
following data for a cow brought to market:


_Part_ _Use_ _Price/lb ($)_


Horns Gelatin 0.42
Collagen
Cheek Sausage 0.55
Baloney
Adrenal Gland Steroids 2.85
Meat Beef 1.05
Lips Taco Filling 0.19
Hide Footwear 0.75
Clothing


Comment on the scope economies illustrated by this example. What is the source of
such economies? What does the existence
of such economies imply about the supply
of such products as leather skins, beef, and
gelatin powder?

AVERAGE COST, MARGINAL COST, AND COST MINIMIZATION


Average cost is defined to be _AC(q)_ = [ _C(q)_ + _F_ ] _/q_ . Differentiate this with respect to
output to yield:







(4.A1)
_q_



_q_ [2] =







_MC (q)_ ~~_q_~~
   - [[] _[C][(][q][)]_ [+] _[F]_ []]



~~_q_~~

 - [[] _[MC][(][q][)]_ [ −] _[AC][(][q][)]_ []]

_q_ [2] = _q_

_q_



_dAC(q)_

_dq_ =



_q_ _[dC][(][q][)]_




_[(]_ _[)]_ [ _C(q)_ _F_ ]

~~_dq_~~

 - +



The denominator is positive. So, if marginal cost exceeds average cost, the slope is
positive. Raising output raises average cost. If average cost exceeds marginal cost, the slope
is negative. Raising output lowers average cost. Minimizing average cost curve requires
that the AC slope be zero, or that average cost and marginal cost are equal.

Derivation of total and average cost functions assumes that firms produce each output
level at minimum cost. A necessary condition for such minimization is that the following
equation be satisfied for any pair of inputs _i_ and _j_ :



which is equivalent to _[MP][i]_
; _wi_



_MPi_
_MPj_




_[w][i]_
= _wj_

In other words, inputs should be used up to the point where the marginal product of the
last dollar spent on input _i_ equals the marginal product of the last dollar spent on input _j_ .


THE SCALE ECONOMY INDEX AND THE ELASTICITY
OF TOTAL COST


The standard definition of the elasticity _ηC_ of costs with respect to output is the proportionate
increase in total cost that results from a given proportionate increase in output. This can be
written as:
