If the coefficient on this term is positive, it says that the discount associated with, say, a
Saturday night stay-over requirement declines as the level of concentration rises. Stavins’
(2001) results are shown in Table 6.1.

The first four columns indicate that passengers do indeed pay different prices depending
on the restrictions applied to their rides. These effects are both statistically significant and
economically substantial. For example, passengers who accepted the requirement that they
not return until after Saturday night paid 25 percent less on average than those who did not
accept this restriction even though they were otherwise getting the same flight service.

However, the real issue is how these discounts vary as the extent of competition in the
market as measured by _HI_ varies. This is where the next four columns become relevant as
they show what happens when the term interacting competition or concentration and ride
restrictions is included. In both cases, the estimated coefficient on the interaction term is
positive. This indicates that while ride restrictions still lead to price reductions, this effect
diminishes as the airline route becomes less competitive or has high concentration.

Given the range of _HI_ values observed over the twelve routes Stavins (2001) studies,
she estimates that in the most competitive markets, a Saturday night stay-over requirement
led to a price reduction of about $253, whereas in the least competitive ones the same
restriction led to a price reduction of only $165. Likewise, an advance purchase requirement
was associated with a price reduction of $111 in the most competitive markets but a cut of
only $41 in the least competitive markets.


**Summary**



In this chapter, we have extended our analysis
of price discrimination to cases in which firms
employ more sophisticated, nonlinear pricing
schemes. Our focus has been on commonly
observed examples of such nonlinear pricing
schemes. These are: 1) two-part pricing in which
the firm charges a fixed fee plus a price per unit
and 2) block pricing in which the firm bundles
the quantity being offered with the total charge
for that quantity. Both schemes have the same



objective, to increase the monopolist’s profit
either by increasing the surplus on existing sales
or by extending sales to new markets, or both.

The most perfect form of price discrimination,
first-degree price discrimination or personalized
pricing, can only be practiced when the firm can
costlessly solve the identification and arbitrage
problems. The firm needs to be able to identify
the different types of consumers and must also
be able to keep them apart. If this is possible,


140 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice



then two-part tariffs and block pricing can, in
principle, convert _all_ consumer surplus into revenues for the firm. The positive side to this is that
the firm supplies the socially efficient level of
output to each consumer type. The negative side
is that there are potentially severe distributional
inequities in that all social surplus takes the form
of profit.

If the requirements necessary to practice perfect price discrimination are not met, then the
monopoly seller cannot achieve such a large
profit. However, the monopolist can employ
second-degree price discrimination or menu pricing, another form of nonlinear pricing. Seconddegree price discrimination differs from both
first- and third-degree in that it relies on the
pricing mechanism itself—usually block pricing
that exhibits quantity discounts—to induce consumers to _self-select_ into groups that reveal their
identity or who they are on the demand curve.

The use of a quantity discount to sort or screen
consumers must always satisfy an _incentive com-_
_patibility_ constraint across the different consumer
types. This constraint weakens the monopolist’s
ability to extract consumer surplus. Because
the incentive compatibility constraint adversely
affects profits, the monopolist may choose to
avoid it by refusing to serve low-demand markets, with the result that the low-demand type


**Problems**


1. Many universities allocate financial aid to
undergraduate students on the basis of some
measure of need. Does this practice reflect
charity or price discrimination? If it reflects
price discrimination, do you think it lies
closer to first-degree discrimination or thirddegree discrimination?


2. A food co-op sells a homogenous good called
groceries, denoted _g_ . The co-op’s cost function is described by: _C(g)_ = _F_ + _cg_ ; where
_F_ denotes fixed cost and _c_ is the constant
per unit variable cost. At a meeting of the
co-op board, a young economist proposes
the following marketing strategy: Set a fixed
membership fee _M_ and a price per unit of
groceries _pM_ that members pay. In addition,
set a price per unit of groceries _pN_ higher
than _pM_ at which the co-op will sell groceries
to non-members.



consumers are clearly worse off. As a consequence, the welfare effects of second-degree
price discrimination are not clear. Yet unlike the
case of third-degree discrimination (with linear
demand curves at least), second-degree pricing
strategies do have some positive probability of
making things better.

Market power is a necessary requirement for
price discrimination. Perfectly competitive firms
take the market price as a given and must charge
that price to all customers. It is for this reason
that we have set our discussion of price discrimination in a monopoly context. Yet while a
monopoly framework is convenient, all that is
strictly required is a setting of imperfect competition. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the
use of price discrimination by firms may also
be a means of implementing competition when
firms are imperfectly competitive rivals. Price
discrimination permits firms with market power
to offer price cuts to customers of a rival brand
without offering such price cuts to those among
its current customers who are not price sensitive.
Supporting evidence for this view may be found
in many studies, including that by Stavins (2001)
on airline competition. Together, this theory and
evidence suggest that price discrimination as a
tool for inter-firm rivalry can push imperfect
competition closer to the competitive ideal.

3. At Starbuck’s coffee shops, coffee drinkers
have the option of sipping their lattes and
cappuccinos while surfing the Internet on
their laptops. These connections are made
via a connection typically provided by a
wireless firm such as T-Mobile. Using a
credit card, customers can buy Internet time
in various packages. A one-hour package
currently goes for an average price of $6.
A day pass that is good for any time in the
next 24 hours sells for $10. A seven-day
pass sells for about $40. Briefly describe the
pricing tactics reflected in these options.

by a typical student is _Q_ _[S]_ = 18 − 3 _P_ . The

tokens be for students? What will be the
cover charge and number of tokens given to

this regime?

# **7** **Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly**

Most firms sell more than one product. Microsoft offers not only an operating system and
an Internet browser but also a number of other products, most notably, the word-processing
package _Word_, the spreadsheet software _Excel_, and the presentation package _PowerPoint_ .
High-tech firms such as Apple sell a wide range of computers including a tablet computer,
a music player, and a mobile telephone. Major automobile manufacturers such as Toyota
offer a bewildering array of mid-range automobiles and a range of higher-end autos under
other brand names, such as _Lexus_ . Companies such as Comcast offer telephone, television,
and Internet services. Fashion designers such as Ralph Lauren offer a broad range of apparel
from sportswear to haute couture, for both women and men.

Indeed, even the most cursory examination of consumer markets suggests that the multiproduct firm is likely to be the norm rather than the exception. Take a company such as
Kellogg’s. Is there any flavor, color, or texture of breakfast cereal that they do not market?
Or consider Procter & Gamble, a large consumer product company that offers more than
a dozen varieties of their _Head and Shoulders_ shampoo and even more varieties of their
_Crest_ toothpaste.

This leads us to the question of exactly how much variety a firm should aim to offer.
Indeed Procter & Gamble asked itself the same question when it reexamined its product
strategy in the early 1990s. By 1996, the company had reduced its list of products by
one-third as compared with 1991. All the evidence suggests, however, that the past decade
has seen the company once more expand its product range.

A firm’s incentive to offer many varieties of what is essentially the same
product—breakfast foods, hair or tooth care—is simple enough to understand. It is a way
for the firm to appeal and sell to consumers with very different tastes. Because we as
consumers differ in our most preferred color, flavor, or texture, selling successfully to
many consumers requires offering something a little different to each of them. Specifically,
to induce a consumer to make a purchase the firm must market a product that is reasonably
close to the version that the consumer most prefers. When a firm offers a variety of
products in response to different consumer tastes, it is adopting a strategy that we refer to
as _horizontal product differentiation_ .

There are other cases in which consumers agree on the product features that make for
a “good” product. For example, all consumers likely agree that a car with antilock brakes
is better than one without such a stopping mechanism. Similarly, all probably agree that
while a _3 Series_ BMW is an attractive car, it pales in comparison to the _7 Series_ . Everyone


Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly 143


is likely to agree that flying from Boston to San Francisco first class is a better than flying
coach. Where consumers differ in these cases is not in what features they consider to be
desirable but, instead, in how much a desired feature is worth to them. In other words,
consumers differ not in their rankings of product quality but rather in how much they are
willing to pay for antilock brakes, a better BMW, or first class airfare. When a firm responds
to differences in consumer willingness to pay for quality of a product by offering different
qualities of the same product, it is called _vertical product differentiation_ .

In this chapter, we analyze the horizontal and vertical product differentiation strategies
of a monopoly firm, focusing in particular on how product differentiation may be used by
the firm to increase profitability. We also consider the welfare properties of these strategies.


7.1 A SPATIAL APPROACH TO HORIZONTAL PRODUCT
DIFFERENTIATION


We begin by considering a market in which consumers agree both on the quality of the
product being considered, whether this be breakfast cereal, hair treatment, or an automobile,
and on their willingness to pay for this product. However, consumers differ with respect
to the specific features of the product that make the product attractive to them: they may
differ, for example, in their most preferred taste, color, or location of the product. In other
words, all consumers may agree on the quality of and their willingness to pay for a product,
perhaps a margherita pizza, if it is sold at a shop close to their home. However, not all
consumers are equidistant from the shop. Some are close and some are far away. Given the
time and effort required to travel, the willingness to pay of those who live far from the shop
will be lower. By contrast, those who live close—and who therefore do not have to incur
travel expenses—will be willing to pay a higher price. The fact that a product sold close to
home is different from one that is sold far away is a good example of horizontal product
differentiation. Such differentiation is characterized by the property that each consumer
has his or her own preferred location of the shop or product, namely, one close to the
consumer’s own address.

When the consumer market is differentiated by geographic location, a firm can vary its
product strategy through its choice of where the product is sold. The firm may choose to
sell its product only in one central location to which all shoppers must come: high-end
designers such as Giorgio Armani or Burberry for example, do this. Alternatively, it may
decide to offer the product at many locations spaced throughout the city: McDonald’s,
Dunkin’ Donuts, and Subway are obvious examples. Customers are not indifferent between
these alternative strategies. If the firm sells only at one central location, those who do not
live in the middle of town have to incur travel costs to come to the store. These costs are
greatest for those living farthest from the center. The alternative strategy of selling at many
different locations allows more consumers to purchase the good without going too far out
of their way.

When geography is taken into account and traveling is costly, consumers are willing
to pay more for a product marketed close to their own geographic location. In this case,
products are differentiated by the locations at which they are sold. This setting is known as
the _spatial model of product differentiation_, pioneered by Hotelling (1929). [1]


1 Hotelling (1929) was concerned with analyzing competition between two stores whereas we consider here
the case in which the stores are owned by the same firm and so act cooperatively.


144 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Before presenting the model formally, there is a very important feature of the model
that must be emphasized. It proves convenient to develop the model using a geographic
representation that can easily be interpreted. With just a little imagination, however,
geographic space can be transformed into a “product” or, more properly “characteristics
space.” In such a space, each consumer’s “location” reflects that consumer’s most preferred
set of product characteristics such as color, style, or other features. Recall our earlier
discussion in Chapter 4 of a soft-drink firm offering a product line differing in terms
of sugar content. That example made use of precisely this type of horizontal or spatial
differentiation.

Extending the analogy, the travel cost of the geographic model can be interpreted as
a psychic or utility cost that the consumer incurs if she must purchase a good whose
characteristics are “distant” from her most preferred type. Just as consumers prefer to go
to video stores close to their home, so they prefer to buy clothes that are “close” to their
individual preferred style, or soft drinks close to their preferred amount of sugar content. In
fact, Hotelling suggested just this interpretation in his seminal article:


Distance, as we have used it for illustration, is only a figurative term for a great congeries
of qualities. Instead of sellers of an identical commodity separated geographically we might
have considered two _. . ._ cider merchants _. . ._ one selling a sweeter liquid than the other. If
consumers of cider are thought of as varying by infinitesimal degrees in the sourness they
desire, we have much the same situation as before. The measure of sourness now represents
distance, while instead of transportation costs there are degrees of disutility resulting from the
consumer getting cider more or less different from what he wants. (Hotelling, 1929, 54)


7.2 MONOPOLY AND HORIZONTAL DIFFERENTIATION


Assume that there is a town spread out along a single road, call it Main Street, that is
one mile in length. There are _N_ consumers who live spaced evenly along this road from
one end of town to the other. A firm that has a monopoly in, for example, fast food must
decide how to serve these consumers at the greatest profit. What this means is that the
monopolist must choose the number of retail outlets or shops that it will operate, where
these should be located on Main Street, and what prices should be charged. In the product
differentiation analogy to drinks of different sweetness, the monopolist has to decide how
many different drinks it should offer, what their precise degrees of sweetness should be, and
what their prices should be. More generally, what range of products should the monopolist
bring to the market and how should they be priced? In what follows we use the geographic
interpretation of the model for clarity, but we again emphasize that you should always bear
in mind its much wider interpretation.

In this section, we consider cases in which the monopolist does not price discriminate
among the consumers that are served. [2] When a consumer travels to a retail outlet in order
to buy a product the consumer incurs transport costs. We assume that the transportation
cost is _t_ per unit of distance (there-and-back) traveled. Except for their addresses or their
locations, consumers are identical to each other. We further assume that in each period each
consumer is willing to buy exactly one unit of the product sold by the monopolist provided
that the price paid, including transport costs, which we call the _full price_, is less than the
reservation price, which we denote by _V_ .


2 The case in which the monopolist price discriminates is developed in section 7.4.


Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly 145



Suppose that the monopolist decides to operate only a single retail outlet. Then it makes
sense to locate this outlet at the center of Main Street. Now consider the monopolist’s
pricing decision. The essentials of the analysis are illustrated in Figure 7.1. The westernmost
resident (residing at the left end of the diagram) has an address of _z_ = 0, the easternmost
resident has an address of _z_ = 1, and the shop is located at _z_ = 1 _/_ 2.

The vertical axis in Figure 7.1 measures the price. A price of _V_ in this diagram is the
reservation price for each consumer. The full price that each consumer pays is comprised of
two parts. First, there is the price _p_ 1 actually set by the monopolist. Secondly, there is the
additional cost consumers incur in getting to the shop (and back home). Measured per unit
of distance there and back, the _full price_ actually paid by a consumer who lives a distance
_x_ from the center of town is the monopolist’s price plus the transport cost, or _p_ 1 _tx_ . This
full price is indicated by the Y-shaped set of lines in Figure 7.1. It indicates that the full +
price paid by a consumer at the center of town—one who incurs no transport cost—is just
_p_ 1. However, as the branches of the Y indicate, the full price rises steadily above _p_ 1 for
consumers both east and west of the town center. So long as distance from the shop is
less than _x_ 1, the consumer’s reservation price _V_ exceeds the full price _p_ 1 _tx_ and such a
consumer buys the monopolist’s product. However, for distances beyond _x_ +1 the full price
exceeds _V_ and these consumers do not buy the product. In other words, the monopolist
serves all those who live within a distance of _x_ 1 units of the town center.

How is the distance _x_ 1 determined? Consumers who reside distance _x_ 1 from the shop are
just indifferent between buying the product and not buying it at all. For them, the full price
_p_ 1 + _tx_ 1 is equal to _V_ so we have:



_p_ 1 _tx_ 1 _V_ which implies that _x_ 1 _[V]_ [ −] _[p]_ [1]
+ = = _t_



(7.1)
_t_



It is important to note that _x_ 1 is just a fraction. Because the town is one mile long, _x_ 1 is a
fraction of a mile and the retail outlet sells to a fraction 2 _x_ 1 of the whole town—because it
sells to consumers that fall to the left and to the right of the market center so long as they live
no further than _x_ 1 from the shop. Recall that we assume that there are _N_ consumers evenly
distributed over Main Street. Accordingly, there are 2 _x_ 1 _N_ consumers who each are willing
to buy one unit of the product if it is priced at _p_ 1. By substituting the expression for _x_ 1 from

146 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


equation (7.1) into the number of customers served by the monopolist, 2 _x_ 1 _N_ at price _p_ 1, we
find that the total demand for the monopolist’s product given that it operates just one shop is:

_Q(p_ 1 _,_ 1 _)_ 2 _x_ 1 _N_ [2] _[N]_ (7.2)
= = _t_ _[(V]_ [ −] _[p]_ [1] _[)]_

Equation (7.2) tells us something interesting. Even though we have assumed that each
consumer buys exactly one unit or none of the monopolist’s product, the demand function
of equation (7.2) shows that aggregate demand smoothly increases as the monopolist lowers
its price. The reason is illustrated in Figure 7.2. When the shop price is reduced from _p_ 1 to
_p_ 2 demand increases because _more consumers are willing to buy the product at the lower_
_price_ . Now all consumers within distance _x_ 2 of the shop buy the product.

This raises an important question. Suppose that the monopolist wants to sell to every
customer in town. What is the _highest_ price that the monopolist can set and still be able
to sell to all _N_ consumers? The answer must be the price at which the consumers who
live furthest from the shop, i.e., those who are half a mile away, are just willing to buy.
At any shop price _p_ these consumers pay a full price of _p_ + _t/_ 2 and so will buy only
if _p_ + _t/_ 2 ≤ _V_ . What this tells us is that with a single retail outlet located at the market
center, the maximum price that the monopolist can charge and still supply the entire market
of _N_ consumers with its one store is _p(N,_ 1 _)_ given by:


_p(N,_ 1 _)_ _V_ (7.3)
=     - 2 _[t]_



Suppose that the monopolist’s marginal production costs are _c_ per unit sold. Suppose also
that there are set-up costs of _F_ for each retail outlet. These set-up costs could be associated
with the cost of buying a site, commissioning the building, and so on. In the product
differentiation analogy, the setup costs might be the costs of designing and marketing the
new product. Whatever the framework, the monopolist’s profit with a single retail outlet
that supplies the entire market is:











_π(N,_ 1 _)_ = _N_ [ _p(N,_ 1 _)_ - _c_ ] − _F_ = _N_



_V_
 - 2 _[t]_

We can now confirm that this single shop should indeed be located in the center of town.
Very simply, this is the location that makes it possible for the single outlet to supply the

a move a little to the east will not gain any new customers on the east end of town (there
are no more to gain) but will lose some of those at the extreme west end of town. In other
words, if the firm moves from the center, the only way it can continue to serve the entire
town is by cutting its price below _V_

Of course, there is no reason to believe that the monopolist will actually want to operate
a single outlet. What happens when there are two, or three, or _n_ outlets along Main Street?
As before, we continue to assume that unit cost at each shop is _c_ per unit sold and that the
set-up cost for each outlet is _F_ . In other words there are no scope economies from operating
multiple outlets. We start by asking what happens if the number of retail outlets is increased
to two. Because each segment of the market along Main Street is the same and each shop
has the same costs, the monopolist will choose to set the same price at each shop. Moreover
the monopolist will want to coordinate the location of these two shops so as to maximize
the price charged at a shop while still reaching the entire market. In other words, the same
intuition that justifies a central location with one outlet can be used to show that the optimal
location strategy with two outlets is to locate one of the two 1 _/_ 4 mile from the left-hand
end and the other 1 _/_ 4 mile from the right-hand end of Main Street, as in Figure 7.3. [3]

With two retail outlets located as we have just discussed, the maximum distance that any
consumer has to travel to a shop is 1 _/_ 4 mile—much less than the 1 _/_ 2 mile when there
is only one retail outlet. As a result, the highest price that the monopolist can charge and
supply the entire market is:



_p(N,_ 2 _)_ _V_ (7.5)
=    - 4 _[t]_



which is higher than the price with a single retail outlet. The monopolist’s profit is now:

Now suppose that the monopolist decides to operate three shops. By exactly the same
argument as above, these shops should be located symmetrically at 1 _/_ 6, 1 _/_ 2, and 5 _/_ 6 miles
from the left-hand end of the market so that each supplies 1 _/_ 3 of the market, as illustrated
in Figure 7.4. The maximum distance that any consumer has to travel now is 1 _/_ 6 mile, so
the price at each shop (again assuming, of course, that all consumers are to be served) is:

There is, in fact, a general rule emerging. If the monopolist has _n_ retail outlets to serve the
entire market, they will be located symmetrically at distances 1 _/_ 2 _n,_ 3 _/_ 2 _n,_ 5 _/_ 2 _n, . . ., (_ 2 _i_ 1 _)/_ 2 _n, . . ., (_ 2 _n_ - 1 _)/_ 2 _n_ from the left-hand end of the market. The maximum distance that
any consumer has to travel to a shop is 1 _/_ 2 _n_ miles, so the price that the monopolist can
charge at each shop while supplying the entire market is


_p(N, n)_ _V_ (7.9)
=     - 2 _[t]_ _n_

At this price, its profit is












- _nF_ (7.10)



_π(N, n)_ = _N_

Note an important feature of this analysis. As the number of retail outlets _n_ increases, the
monopolist’s price at each outlet gets closer and closer to the consumer’s reservation price
_V_ . In other words, by increasing the number of shops, the monopolist is able to charge
each consumer a price much closer to the consumer’s maximum willingness to pay, _V_, and
thereby appropriate a much greater proportion of consumer surplus.

The moral of the foregoing analysis is clear—especially when we remember to interpret
the geographic space of Main Street as a more general product space. Even if no scope
economies are present, a monopolist has an incentive to offer many varieties of a good.
Doing so allows the monopolist to exploit the wide variety of consumer tastes, charging


Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly 149


each consumer a high price because each is being offered a variety that is very close to the
consumer’s specific most preferred type. It is not surprising, therefore, that we see such
extensive product proliferation in real-world markets such as those for cars, soft drinks,
toothpastes, hair shampoos, cameras, and so on. [4]

However, there must be some factor limiting this proliferation of varieties or outlets. We
do not observe a McDonald’s on every street corner, or a personally customized Ford _Focus_,
or each person’s custom-designed breakfast cereals or soft drinks! We therefore need to
think about what constrains the monopolist from adding more and more retail outlets or
product variants. Equation (7.10) gives the clue. Admittedly, adding additional retail outlets
allows the monopolist to increase its prices. However, the establishment of each additional
new shop or new product variant also incurs an additional set-up cost. If, for example, the
monopolist decides to operate _n_ + 1 retail outlets its profit is

_V_
 - 2 _(n_ 1 _)_
+ [−] _[c]_







_π(N, n_ + 1 _)_ = _N_




- _(n_ + 1 _)F_ (7.11)



This additional shop, or variety of drink, or new product variant increases profit if and
only if _π(N, n_ + 1 _) > π(N, n)_, which requires that:

_t_ _t_
2 _n_ _[N]_ [ −] 2 _(n_ + 1 _)_ _[N]_ [ −] _[F >]_ [ 0]

This simplifies to:


_n(n_ 1 _) <_ _[tN]_ (7.12)
+ 2 _F_

Suppose, for example, that there are 5 million consumers in the market so that _N_ =
5,000,000 and that there is a fixed cost _F_ = $50,000 associated with each shop. Suppose
further that the transport cost _t_ = $1. Hence, _tN/_ 2 _F_ = 50. Then if _n_ is less than or equal to
6, equation (7.12) is satisfied, indicating that it is profitable to add a further shop. However,
once the monopolist sets up _n_ = 7 shops, equation (7.12) is no longer satisfied, indicating
that it is not profitable to add any more shops. (You can easily check that the monopolist
should operate exactly 7 shops for any value of _tN/_ 2 _F_ greater than 42 but less than 56.)

If we ignore the fact that the number of retail outlets _n_ has to be an integer, we can
be even more precise about the profit maximizing number of retail outlets (or number of
product variants). We show in the Appendix to this chapter that the monopolist maximizes
profit as given by equation (7.10) with respect to the number of retail outlets _n_ by setting







_tN_
(7.13)
2 _F_



_n_ [∗] =



Equations (7.12) and (7.13) actually have a simple and appealing intuition. The monopolist
has to balance the increase in price and revenues that results from increased product variety
against the additional setup costs that offering increased variety entails. What this tells us
is that we would expect to find greater product variety in markets where there are many
consumers ( _N_ is large), or where the set-up costs of increasing product variety are low


4 See Shapiro and Varian (1999) for a similar argument regarding product variety in e-commerce markets.


150 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


( _F_ is small), or where consumers have strong and distinct preferences regarding product
characteristics ( _t_ is large).

The first two conditions should be obvious. It tells us why there are many more retail
outlets in Chicago than in Peoria; why we see many franchise outlets of the same fast-food
chain but not of a gourmet restaurant; and why we see many more Subway outlets in a city
than Marriott hotels. What does the third condition mean? For a given number of shops, _n_,
equation (7.12) tells us that an additional ( _n_ + 1) shop will be increasingly desirable the
greater that transportation cost _t_ is. Thus, as _t_ increases, so will the monopolist’s optimal
number of outlets or degree of product variety.

The intuition is that when _t_ is high consumers incur very large costs if they are not
offered their most preferred brand. That is, a large value of _t_ implies that consumers
are very strongly attached to their preferred product type or location and are unwilling
to purchase products that deviate significantly from this type—or travel very far to buy
the product—unless they are offered a significant price discount. If the monopolist is to
continue to attract consumers while maintaining high prices it must tailor its products more
closely to each consumer’s unique demand, which requires that it offer a wider range of
product variants—or operate more retail outlets.

To summarize, in this kind of market, adding a new shop or a new product variant does
not necessarily mean increasing the total supply of the good. Instead, it means replacing
some of an existing variety with an alternative variety that more closely matches the specific
tastes of some customers. As we have seen, this also allows the firm to charge a higher
price. Yet this advantage does not come free. The firm must incur the set-up cost _F_ for each
new outlet or product variant.

This raises another important question. Is it actually profitable for the monopolist to serve
the entire market? To answer this question we need to identify the condition that determines
whether the monopolist will prefer to supply only part of the market rather than the whole
market.

If only part of the market is served then each retail outlet is effectively a “stand alone”
shop whose market area does not touch that of the remaining outlets, as in Figure 7.5.
Again, we use the mathematical appendix to show that the profit-maximizing price when
only part of the market is served is _p_ [∗] = _(V_ + _c)/_ 2, which does not depend on the number
of outlets or product variants the monopolist has. This leads to a simple rule that determines
whether or not the entire market is to be served. Suppose that there are _n_ retail outlets.
Then we know from equation (7.9) that the price at which the entire market can be served
is _p(N, n)_ = _V_ - _t/_ 2 _n_ . Serving the entire market is therefore better than supplying only
part of the market provided _p(N, n) > p_ [∗] . In turn, this requires:



2 _[t]_ _n_ _[> ][V]_ [ +] 2 _[ c]_



_V_
 - 2 _[t]_




_[ c]_ _V > c_ _[t]_

2 ⇒ +



(7.14)
_n_



We can put this rule another way. What equation (7.14) tells us is that the monopolist’s
optimal pricing policy can be described as follows:


1. If marginal production cost plus per unit transport cost divided by the number of retail
outlets, _c_ + _t/n_, is greater than the consumers’ reservation price _V_, the monopolist
should set a price at each shop of _p_ ∗= _(V_ + _c)/_ 2 and supply only part of the market.
2. If marginal production plus per unit transport cost divided by the number of retail
outlets, _c_ + _t/n_, is less than the consumers’ reservation price _V_, the monopolist should
set a price at each shop of _p(N, n)_ = _V_   - _t/_ 2 _n_ and supply the entire market.

**Figure 7.5** Non-competing retail shops on main street


The intuition behind this rule is relatively straightforward. When the consumer reservation
price is low relative to production and transportation costs and when there are few outlets,
trying to supply the entire market gives the monopolist a very low margin over operating
costs and could even lead to selling at a loss. By contrast, when the consumer reservation
price is high relative to the cost of production and transportation and there are many outlets,
a price that allows the monopolist to supply the entire market offers a reasonable margin
over costs. In these latter circumstances, the monopolist will not wish to set a high price that
sacrifices any sales. Because the marginal revenue of every unit sold significantly exceeds
the production cost, the monopolist will wish to sell all the units it can.


7.3 IS THERE TOO MUCH PRODUCT VARIETY?


Our analysis in the previous section implies that a profit-maximizing firm with market
power may have an incentive to create a large number of outlets or product varieties
so as to provide each consumer with something close to the consumer’s most preferred
product and thereby extract a high price. It is easy to think of real-world firms that,
while not pure monopolists, have substantial market power and employ this strategy. For
instance, automobile manufacturers market many varieties of compact, midsize, and large
luxury-class cars. Franchise operations such as McDonald’s or Subway grant exclusive
geographic rights so as to space their outlets evenly over an area and avoid competition
between neighboring franchises. Digital cameras come in a bewildering variety of styles
and colors. Soft drink, cereal, and ice cream companies offer a wide array of minimally
differentiated goods.

The sometimes overwhelming degree of product variety that we frequently observe
raises the question whether the incentive to offer a wide variety of product types is too
strong. Does the monopolist provide the degree of product variety that is consistent with
maximizing social welfare? Or are the incentives so strong that the monopolist provides
too much product variety? To answer this question, we first need to describe the socially
optimal degree of product variety. Although the argument can be made in general terms, it
is easiest to see the answer for the case in which the entire market is served.

We use the efficiency criterion to determine the optimality of the variety of products
offered. This requires that we choose the degree of product variety that maximizes total
surplus, which is defined, as usual, as aggregate consumer surplus plus producer profit.


152 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Suppose that there are _n_ retail outlets. With every consumer buying the product, the total
consumer valuation placed on the monopolist’s production is _NV_ . To calculate aggregate
consumer surplus we need to deduct from this valuation the total spending by consumers,
which is payment of the product price, _Np(N, n)_ plus payment of the transport costs.
Denote aggregate transport cost with _n_ retail outlets as _T (N, n)_ . Then aggregate consumer
surplus is

_CS(N, n)_ = _NV_  - _Np(N, n)_  - _T (N, n)_ (7.15)

Aggregate profit is receipt from consumers of the product price minus production costs and
set-up costs. [5] In other words, aggregate producer profit is

_�(N, n)_ = _Np(N, n)_  - _Nc_  - _nF_ (7.16)

Summing these gives total surplus:

_TS(N, n)_ = _NV_  - _Nc_  - _T (N, n)_  - _nF_ (7.17)

Note that the first two terms of _TS(N, n)_ are independent of the number of retail outlets
the firm establishes. In fact, once all _N_ consumers are served, only two factors change as
more stores or product varieties are added. One of these is the transport cost incurred by
a typical or average consumer. Clearly, as more shops are added, more consumers find
themselves closer to a store and this cost falls. That’s the good news. The bad news is
that adding more shops also incurs the additional setup cost of _F_ per shop. Our question
about whether the monopolist provides too many (or too few) shops thus comes down to
determining whether it is the good news or the bad news that dominates.

More formally, when all consumers are served, the total surplus is the total value _NV_,
minus the total production cost _Nc_, minus the total transportation and setup costs. Because
the first two terms are fixed independent of the number of shops, maximizing the total
surplus is equivalent to minimizing the sum of transportation and setup costs. Does the
monopolist’s strategy achieve this result?

One feature of the monopoly outcome makes answering this question a little easier.
The monopolist always spaces its shops evenly along Main Street no matter how many it
operates. That is, a single shop is located at the center, two shops are located at 1 _/_ 4 and 3 _/_ 4,
and so on. This greatly simplifies the calculation of total transportation cost that consumers
incur for any number of shops _n_ .

Consider Figure 7.6, which shows both the full price and the transportation cost paid
by those consumers buying from a particular outlet, shop _i_ . As before, the top Y-shaped
figure shows that a consumer located right next to the store has no transport cost and pays
a price of _p_ _V_
=     - 2 _[t]_ _n_ [. As we consider consumers farther from the shop, the branches]

of the Y show that the full price rises because these consumers incur greater and greater
transportation costs. The lower branches in the figure provide a direct measurement of this
transportation cost for each such consumer. Again, the transportation cost for a consumer
located right next to the store is zero. It rises gradually to _t/_ 2 _n_ —the transportation cost paid
by a consumer who lives the maximum distance from the shop. Total transportation cost for
the consumers of shop _i_ is the sum of the individual transportation cost of each consumer.


5 Transportation costs are paid by consumers and so do not figure into the profit calculation.

**Figure 7.6** Costs of serving customers when there are _n_ shops


This is indicated by the areas of the symmetric triangles _abc_ and _cde_ in Figure 7.6. Each
of these triangles has a height of _t/_ 2 _n_ . Each also has a base 1/2 _n_ . Hence, the area of each
is _t_ /8 _n_ [2] . Remember though that the base reflects the fraction of the total _N_ consumers
that shop _i_ serves in either direction. This means that to translate this area into actual
dollars of transportation costs that the consumers of shop _i_ pay, we have to multiply
through by _N_ . The result is that the customers who patronize shop _i_ from the east pay a
total transportation cost of _tN/_ 8 _n_ [2] as do those who patronize it from the west. The total
transportation costs incurred by all consumers of shop _i_ is therefore the sum of these two
amounts, or _tN/_ 4 _n_ [2] . If we now multiply this by the number of shops _n_, we find that the
total transportation costs associated with all _n_ shops is simply _T (N, n)_ = _tN/_ 4 _n_ . The same
exercise tells us that the total setup costs for all _n_ shops is _nF_ . Accordingly, the aggregate
transportation plus setup costs associated with serving all _N_ customers and operating _n_
shops are:


_C(N, n)_ _[tN]_ (7.18)
= 4 _n_ [+] _[ nF]_

By the same argument, aggregate transportation plus setup costs with ( _n_ + 1) shops are

_tN_
_C(N, n_ 1 _)_ (7.19)
+ = 4 _(n_ 1 _)_
+ [+] _[ (n]_ [ +][ 1] _[)F]_

Recall that our goal is to minimize this total cost. Therefore, we want to add an additional
shop so long as doing so results in a reduction in total costs. Comparison of equations (7.19)
and (7.18) indicates that this will be the case, that is, _C(n_ + 1 _) < C(n)_, if:

_tN_ _tN_
(7.20)
4 _n_ 4 _(n_ 1 _)_ _[> F]_

[−] +

Simplification of this inequality tells us that it will be socially beneficial to add one more
shop or one more product variant beyond the _n_ existing ones so long as:


_n(n_ 1 _) <_ _[tN]_ (7.21)
+ 4 _F_


154 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Suppose that, as in our calculation of the profit-maximizing number of retail outlets, we
ignore the integer constraint on _n_ . Then we show in Mathematical Appendix 4 that the
number of retail outlets maximizes social surplus is, from (7.14):







_tN_
(7.22)
4 _F_



_n_ _[o]_ =



Now compare condition (7.21) or (7.22) with condition (7.12) or (7.13), which describes
the situation under which the monopolist finds it profitable to add an additional shop. The
denominator of the right-hand-side term is 2 _F_ in equations (7.12) and (7.13) while it is
4 _F_ in (7.21) and (7.22). This means that it is less likely for an additional shop to meet
the requirement of equation (7.21) and be socially desirable than it is for it to meet the
requirement of equation (7.12) and enhance the monopolist’s profit. In other words, the
monopolist has an incentive to expand product variety even when the social gains from
doing so have been exhausted. The monopolist chooses too great a degree of product
variety. [See Spence (1976).]

Taking the same example that we had earlier in which _t_ = $1 _, N_ = 5,000,000 _,_ and _F_ =
$50,000. We then have that _tN/_ 4 _F_ = 25. In this case, equation (7.21) implies that
the socially optimal number of shops is five. However, we have already shown that the
monopolist would like to operate seven shops or offer seven product varieties in this market.

Casual evidence supports the “too much variety” hypothesis. Look at the myriad of
ready-to-eat breakfast cereals offered by the major cereal firms, the multitude of options
available on automobiles, and the vast array of finely distinguished perfumes and lipsticks
available at department stores around the country. Admittedly, the producers of these goods
are not pure monopolists, but they do exercise considerable market power and so they are
likely subject to many of the same influences that we have just been considering.

The basic reason why a monopolist offers too much variety is that the firm maximizes
profit, not total surplus. When deciding to add another shop, the monopolist balances the
additional setup cost against the additional revenues that it can earn from being able to
increase prices. However, from the viewpoint of efficiency this additional revenue is not a
net gain. It is just a transfer of surplus from consumers to the monopolist. The true social
optimum balances the setup cost of an extra shop against the reduction in transportation
costs that results. Clearly, this criterion will lead to the establishment of fewer shops than
will the criterion used by the monopolist.

Operating additional shops is attractive to a monopolist because this is the easiest way
to reach what would otherwise be distant consumers. The monopolist operating just one
shop at the center of Main Street can only sell to customers at the eastern and western ends
of town by greatly reducing the price _to all customers_ . The incentive to operate additional
shops is that it permits reaching consumers without so significant a price reduction.

This raises another issue that takes us back to the discussion in Chapters 5 and 6. If
somehow the firm could charge a price to distant consumers that they are willing to pay
_without_ lowering the price to nearby ones, then reaching these distant consumers from just
a few shops or with just a few varieties might be more attractive. That is, if the monopolist
could price discriminate, the tendency to oversupply variety might be much less strong. We
now examine this possibility.


Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly 155


7.4 MONOPOLY AND HORIZONTAL DIFFERENTIATION
WITH PRICE DISCRIMINATION


In our discussion thus far, we have been assuming that the monopolist does not price
discriminate between its customers. This makes sense when customers travel to the shop to
purchase the good and so do not reveal their addresses, or who they are to the monopolist.
Suppose instead that the monopolist controls delivery of the product, and so knows who
is who by their address in the market. What pricing policy might we expect the monopoly
firm to adopt?

It should be clear that when the monopolist controls delivery it will charge every consumer
the consumer’s reservation price _V_ . This is a pricing policy known as _uniform delivered_
_pricing_ . A firm adopting such a pricing policy charges all consumers the same prices and
absorbs the transportation costs in delivering the product to them. This is discriminatory
pricing because even though consumers pay the same price, this price does not reflect
the true costs of supplying consumers in different locations. By way of analogy, charging
a consumer in San Francisco the same price as a consumer in New York for a product
manufactured in New York is just as much discriminatory pricing as charging a different
price for this product to two different New York residents.

As in the no-price-discrimination case, we should check whether the monopoly firm
actually wants to supply every consumer. Suppose that, as before, the firm operates _n_ retail
outlets evenly spaced along Main Street. Then the transportation and production costs that
the firm incurs in supplying the consumers located furthest away from a retail outlet are
_c_ + _t/_ 2 _n_ . There is profit to be made from such sales provided that:

_V > c_ + _t/_ 2 _n_ (7.23)

Notice that this is a weaker condition than equation (7.14) without price discrimination.
This is another example of a typical property of price discrimination. It allows the monopolist
to serve consumers who might otherwise be left unserved.

Now consider how many shops (or product varieties) the price-discriminating monopolist
will choose to operate. Given that the firm is supplying the entire market and is charging
every consumer the consumer’s reservation price of _V_, the firm’s total revenue is fixed
at _NV_ . Total costs are variable production costs, which are fixed at _Nc_, plus the transport
costs that the firm absorbs _T (N, n)_ and the set-up costs _nF_ . These two latter costs are just
the total costs _C(N, n)_ from equation (7.18). Thus the profit of the price-discriminating
monopolist is:







_π(N, n)_ = _NV_ - _Nc_ 



_tN_



4 _n_

[+] _[ nF]_



(7.24)



How does the monopolist maximize profit in this case? Because the first two terms in
(7.24) are fixed, independent of _n_, profit maximization is achieved by minimizing the costs
_C(N, n)_ . But this means that _the discriminating monopolist chooses to offer the socially_
_efficient degree of product variety_ .

If you recall our discussion of price discrimination in Chapter 5, you should not find
this too surprising. We saw in that chapter that a monopolist who engages in first-degree


156 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


price discrimination extracts all consumer surplus and therefore wants to produce the
efficient amount of output. The result just obtained extends that finding to the case of a
product differentiated market. In such a market, a firm that can achieve first-degree price
discrimination not only produces the socially efficient output but also the socially efficient
amount of product variety. With perfect price discrimination the firm expropriates all
consumer surplus. As a result, the degree of product variety that maximizes total profit is
just the degree of product variety that maximizes total surplus. The incentive to go beyond
the socially optimal degree of product variety does not exist.

Price discrimination in a geographic spatial model has a clear interpretation—the
monopoly firm incurs the delivery cost and in doing so charges different net prices for the
same good. How do we interpret price discrimination in a product characteristics space
rather than a geographic one? Alternatively, how can a monopolist control “delivery”
of products that are differentiated by characteristics rather than by location? MacLeod,
Norman, and Thisse (1988) [See also Borenstein (1985).] provide the analogy:


In the context of product differentiation, price discrimination arises when the producer begins
with a “base product” and then redesigns this product to the customers’ specifications. This
means that the firm now produces a _band_ of horizontally differentiated products _. . ._ instead
of a single product _. . ._ Transport cost is no longer interpreted as a utility loss, but as an
additional cost incurred by the firm in adapting its product to the customers’ requirements
_. . ._ (So) long as product design is under the control of the producer— equivalent to the
producer controlling transportation—he need not charge the full cost of design change.
(1988, pp. 442–3)


Consider, for example, buying a Ford _Taurus_ . On the one hand you might choose one
of the standard variants. Alternatively, the salesperson might persuade you into taking a
different sound system, different wheels, an attractive stripe along the side that makes the
car sportier, and so on. Effectively, what the salesperson is doing is making you reveal
your actual “address” through the options you choose, with perhaps the intention of also
separating you from more of your money.

But how easy is it for firms to offer this type of product customization? After all,
customization would seem to imply the sacrifice of economies of scale and so increase
costs. You might be surprised to learn that it is becoming easier and less costly by the day.
The ability to offer this type of product range is what distinguishes _flexible manufacturing_
_systems_, defined as “production units capable of producing a range of discrete products
with a minimum of manual intervention” (US Office of Technology Assessment, 1984,
p. 60). We discussed the properties of these types of manufacturing processes in Chapter 4,
and they are becoming increasingly common. Companies such as Levi Strauss, Custom
Shoe, Italian ceramic tile manufacturers, Ford, Mitsubishi, and Hitachi all operate flexible
manufacturing systems. Any of you who regularly use web retailers such as Amazon.com
will have noticed that the initial page you see upon entering the site changes over time
to reflect your buying habits. You eventually have your very own, customized entry page
resulting in your very own, customized prices. [6]


6 A clear, if brief, expression of the view that e-commerce firms greatly facilitate price discrimination
may be found in P. Krugman, “Reckonings: What Price Fairness,” _New York Times_, October 4, 2000,
p. A16.


Product Variety and Quality Under Monopoly 157


composed of twenty-one households evenly distributed one-tenth of a mile apart along the
main street of the town. Each such household uses at most one unit of smithing services per
month. In addition, each household incurs a there-and-back-again transport cost of $0.50
for every tenth of a mile it lives from Shortchap’s smithery. The reservation price of each
household for such services is $10. Henry’s cost of providing smithing services is $2 per
unit. However, he can operate only one shop at most. Where should Henry locate his shop
and what price should he charge? Suppose instead that Henry could operate a mobile smithy
that allowed him to offer his services at his customers’ homes. However, it would cost him
$0.75 there-and-back-again transport costs for every tenth of a mile he has to move his
smithy. Should he switch to this mobile service?


7.5 VERTICAL PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION


The distinguishing feature of horizontal product differentiation is that consumers do not
agree on what is the preferred variety of product. So, if two different varieties are offered
at the same price, some consumers are likely to buy one variety and other consumers will
buy the other. _Vertical differentiation_ is different. In this case, all consumers agree on
what is the preferred or best product, the next to best product, and so on. If a high- and a
low-quality good are offered at the same price, all consumers will buy the high-quality good.
Lower quality goods will find a market only if they are offered at sufficiently lower prices.
A Chevrolet costs much less than a Cadillac. No-frills airlines such as JetBlue and Southwest
attract customers because their flights are offered at large discounts relative to the larger
carriers such as United and American. The Empire Hotel in New York charges much less
than the Waldorf Astoria. However, while all consumers agree in their ranking of products
from highest to lowest quality, they differ in their willingness to pay for quality. This may
occur because consumers have very different incomes or simply because they have different
attitudes regarding what quality is worth.

We would like to understand the incentives a monopoly firm has to offer different qualities
of a product and the prices that it will charge for them. The analysis we use for this purpose
is a simplified one. Nevertheless, it captures much of the flavor of more general treatments. [7]


7.5.1 Price and Quality Choice with Just One Product


We first consider how changes in quality affect consumer demand when the firm offers
just one product and each consumer buys at most one unit of the good. This will give us
some idea of how quality or product design can be used to enhance a firm’s profit. We
next examine how the firm might increase its profit by offering more than one quality of
a product. The firm knows that there is some feature, or set of features, that can be used
to measure the product quality valued by consumers. The firm’s ability to choose these
features means that it can choose the quality of product as well as its price.


7 The first and classic treatment of this problem is Mussa and Rosen (1978). Unfortunately, this is also a
rather complex analysis.




158 Monopoly Power in Theory and Practice


Suppose, then, that the firm knows that each consumer is willing to pay something extra
to get a higher quality product, but the precise amount extra varies across consumers. Some
consumers place a high value on quality and will gladly pay a considerable premium for a
quality improvement. Others are less concerned with quality and, unless the accompanying
price increase is minimal, such consumers do not buy a better quality but higher priced
good. In other words, each consumer examines the price and quality of the product and the
utility obtained from consuming it. If the consumer places a value on the quality of product
offered that is greater than the price being charged, the consumer purchases the good—say
a CD player. If not, the consumer simply refrains from buying altogether.

The demand curve facing the monopolist depends on the precise quality of the product
marketed. This is reflected in the inverse demand function, denoted by _P_ = _P(Q, z)_, where
the market clearing price _P_ depends not only on how much the firm produces _Q_ but also
on the quality _z_ of these units. To put it somewhat differently, an increase in quality _z_
raises the market-clearing price for any given quantity, _Q_ . The demand curve shifts out (or
up) as product quality _z_ increases.

It is useful to distinguish between two different ways that an increase in quality can shift
the inverse demand curve _P(Q, z)_ . Each is illustrated in Figure 7.7. To better understand
this diagram, note that because consumers vary in terms of their willingness to pay for a
good of given quality _z_, and because each consumer buys at most one unit of the good, the
demand curve really reflects a ranking of consumers in terms of their reservation prices for
a good of a specific quality _z_ . The reservation price of the consumer most willing to pay
for the good is the intercept term. The reservation price of the consumer next most willing
to pay is the next point on the demand curve as we move to the right, and so on. In both
Figures 7.7(a) and 7.7(b), the initial quantity produced is _Q_ 1 and the initial quality is _z_ 1. The
market-clearing price for this quantity–quality combination is _P_ 1. From what we have just
said, this price must be the willingness to pay or the reservation price of the _Q_ 1th consumer.
At price _P_ 1, this consumer is just indifferent between buying the good and not buying it at all
given that it is of quality _z_ 1. This consumer is called the marginal consumer. Consumers to
the left—those consumers who also buy the product—are called _infra_ marginal consumers.

Figure 7.7(a) shows how the inverse demand curve shifts when there is an increase in
quality that raises the willingness to pay of the inframarginal consumers by more than it

raises the willingness to pay of the marginal consumer. An increase in quality from _z_ 1 to
_z_ 2 raises the price at which the quantity _Q_ 1 sells from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2. However, the increase in
the reservation price is greatest for consumers who were already purchasing the product so
that the demand curve shifts by “sliding along” the price axis. Figure 7.7(b) illustrates the
alternative case. Here, the increase in quality from _z_ 1 to _z_ 2 increases the willingness to pay
of the _Q_ 1th or marginal consumer by proportionately more than it raises the reservation
price of the inframarginal consumers. Once again, this quality increase raises the market
price of quantity _Q_ 1 from _P_ 1 to _P_ 2. However, the demand curve now shifts by “sliding
along” the quantity axis. [8]

Whether demand is described by Figure 7.7(a) or 7.7(b), we can see that for the
monopolist the choice of quality really amounts to a decision as to which demand curve
it faces. Increases in quality are attractive because they rotate the demand curve and so
increase the firm’s revenue at any given price. However, it is normally costly to increase
product quality. Therefore what the monopolist has to do is balance the benefits in increased
revenue that improved quality generates against the increased costs that increased quality
incurs. More precisely, the monopolist choosing quality should think through the profitmaximizing calculus in a way similar to that used when choosing output or price. For any
given choice of output, the monopolist should choose the level of quality at which the
marginal revenue from increasing quality equals the marginal cost of increasing quality. In
other words, the monopolist that controls both quality and quantity of its product has _two_
profit maximizing conditions to satisfy. These are:


1. For a given choice of quality, the marginal revenue from the last unit sold should equal
the marginal cost of making that unit at that quality;
2. For a given choice of quantity, the marginal revenue from increasing quality of each
unit of output should equal the additional (marginal) cost of increasing the quality of
that quantity of output.


We illustrate the quality or product design choice by assuming demand is of the type
shown in Figure 7.7(a). More specifically, assume that the demand function is given by the
equation:


_P_ = _z(_ 50 − _Q)_ = 50 _z_  - _zQ_ (7.25)

Equation (7.25) says that regardless of the quality of the product, at a price of zero a total of
50 units will be sold but increased quality causes the demand function to rotate clockwise
about the point _Q_ = 50.

Let us also keep the example simple by assuming that the cost of improving quality
is a sunk design cost so that marginal _production_ cost is independent of the quality of
the product. A better film or software package may require say, more expensive script or
programming, respectively, but the actual costs of showing the film or printing the CD are
independent of how good it is. To make matters even simpler, let us further assume that
production costs are not only constant but also zero. Design costs, however, rise with the
quality level chosen. Specifically, we shall assume that design costs are:

_F(z)_ = 5 _z_ [2] (7.26)

8 For models based on the case illustrated in Figure 7.7(b), some care must be taken to limit the ultimate size
of the market. That is, quality increases cannot indefinitely expand the quantity demanded at a given price.

which implies that the marginal cost of increasing product quality is 10 _z_ (see Appendix 5). [9]

We can now write the firm’s profit to be:


_π(Q, z)_ = _P(Q, z)Q_  - _F(z)_ = _z(_ 50 − _Q)Q_  - 5 _z_ [2] (7.27)

Consider first the profit-maximizing choice of output. This turns out to be very simple
in this case. As usual, marginal revenue has the same intercept as the demand function
but twice the slope. So with the demand function _P_ = 50 _z_ - _zQ_ we know that marginal
revenue is _MR_ = 50 _z_ - 2 _zQ_ = _z(_ 50 − 2 _Q)_ . Equating this with marginal cost gives the
profit-maximizing output condition: _z(_ 50 − 2 _Q)_ = 0. Hence, the profit-maximizing output
is: _Q_ [∗] = 50 _/_ 2 = 25.

In this simple example, the monopolist’s quantity choice is independent of the quality
choice. The profit-maximizing output remains constant at _Q_ [∗] = 25 no matter the choice
of quality. Going back to the demand function, the profit-maximizing price is given
by _P_ [∗] = _z(_ 50 − _Q_ [∗] _)_ so that the optimal price is: _P_ [∗] = 25 _z_ . Unlike output, the profitmaximizing price _**is**_ affected by the choice of quality. Moreover, the quality choice also
affects the firm’s design costs. A higher quality design _z_ permits the monopolist to raise
price and earn more revenue but it also raises the firm’s costs. This is the tradeoff that the
monopolist must evaluate.

To choose the profit-maximizing quality the monopolist must compare the additional
revenue resulting from an increase in _z_ with the increase in design cost that the higher
quality requires. Because the quantity sold is constant at _Q_ [∗] = 25, the additional revenue
of an increase in quality is just this output level times the difference in price that can be
charged following the rise in quality. In our example, we can see from equation (7.20) that
the firm’s revenue _PQ_ at product quality _z_ when it charges the profit-maximizing price
_P_ [∗] = 25 _z_, is:

_P_ [∗] _Q_ [∗] = 25 _z_ 25 = 625 _z_ (7.28)

So, increasing product quality by one “unit” increases revenue by $625, which is therefore
the marginal revenue from increased quality. We know also from equation (7.25) that the
marginal cost of increased quality is 10 _z_ . Equating marginal revenue with marginal cost
then gives the profit-maximizing quality choice:


_z_ [∗] = 625 _/_ 10 = 62.5 (7.29)

An interesting question that arises in connection with the monopolist’s choice of quality
is how that choice compares with the socially optimal one. Does the monopolist produce too


9 For an intuitive understanding, recall that marginal cost is measured at a precise value of _z_, e.g., we
can think of the marginal cost of quality at _z_ = 2, or at _z_ = 8. Wherever marginal cost is measured
however, it is meant to capture _both_ the cost increment of increasing quality by a small amount and
the cost savings from decreasing quality by a small amount. In principle, the answer to either of these
questions should be the same. However, if we consider a one-unit increase in quality, the change in cost
is: 5 _(z_ + 1 _)_ [2]   - 5 _z_ [2] = 5 _(_ 2 _z_ + 1 _)_, whereas if we consider a one-unit decrease in quality, the cost savings
is: 5 _z_ [2]   - 5 _(z_   - 1 _)_ [2] = 5 _(_ 2 _z_   - 1 _)_ . Because we get a slightly different answer depending on whether we
measure marginal cost as an increase from raising quality or a decrease from reducing it, and because
we want to have just one answer, we simply take the average of the two to get a marginal cost of higher
quality = 5 × 2 _z_ = 10 _z_ .

high or too low a quality of good? Looking at Figure 7.7(a) you might be able to work out
that in this case the monopolist’s quality choice is too low. The reason is straightforward.
An increase in _z_ rotates the demand curve upward and increases the total surplus earned
from the 25 units that are always sold. The social optimum requires that quality be increased
so long as this gain in total surplus exceeds the extra design cost. However, the monopolist
only gets to keep the increase in producer surplus that a quality increase generates. As a
result, profit maximization leads the monopoly firm to increase quality only so long as the
extra producer surplus covers the additional design cost. Because the producer surplus is
less than the total surplus, the monopolist will stop short of producing the socially optimal
quality. Of course, the monopolist holds quantity below the optimal amount, too.

Our primary objective however is not to determine whether firms with monopoly power
choose to market products of either too low or too much quality. The main point is to show
that for such firms the quality choice matters. By carefully choosing product quality jointly
with product price, the monopolist can again extract further surplus from the market.

inverse demand curve: _P_ = 4 − _Q/z_ . Here, _P_ is the price per case; _Q_ is the number of
cases or clients; and _z_ is the quality of service Will provides. Will’s costs are independent
of how many cases he actually takes, but they do rise with quality. More specifically, Will’s
costs are given by: _C_ = _z_ [2] .


a. Draw Will’s demand curve for a given quality, _z_ . How do increases in _z_ affect the

c. Compute the market price and profit—net of quality costs—for each of the three
choices above. Which quality choice leads to the highest profits?


7.5.2 Offering More than One Product in a Vertically Differentiated
Market


Now that we have worked through the basics of how product quality can affect market
demand, let’s consider a multi-product strategy. To make it simple, suppose that the
monopolist knows there are only two different types of consumer, distinguished by their
willingness to pay for quality. Each consumer type buys at most one unit of the firm’s
product per period. In deciding which quality of product to buy, a consumer buys the quality
of product yielding the greatest consumer surplus. For consumer type _i_ the consumer
surplus obtained from consuming a product of quality _z_ at price _p_ is:


_Vi_ _θi(z_ _zi)_ _p_ _(i_ 1,2 _)_ (7.30)
=  -  - =

In this equation, _θi_ is a measure of the value that consumers of type _i_ places on quality
and _z_ ~~_i_~~ is the lower bound on quality below which a consumer of type _i_ chooses not to

buy the product. We assume that _θ_ 1 _> θ_ 2. That is, type 1 consumers place a higher value
on quality than type 2 consumers, perhaps because type 1 consumers have higher incomes
than type 2 consumers or more generally because they have more intense preferences for
monopolist’s product unless it is at least of qualityquality. We also assume that _z_ ~~1~~ _> z_ ~~2~~ = 0. In other words, type 1 consumers will not buy the _z_ ~~1~~ . These are consumers who “wouldn’t
be seen dead” flying in coach, eating in fast-food joints, or shopping in discount stores.
By contrast, type 2 consumers are willing to buy the monopolist’s product of any quality
provided, of course, that consumer surplus is non-negative. Unfortunately for the firm,
while it knows that these different consumer types exist, it has no objective measure by
which it can distinguish the different types.

Similar to second-degree price discrimination, the monopolist would like to choose a
product line that identifies and separates customers of different types. The monopolist
would like to induce type 1 consumers to buy a product of high quality _z_ 1 at a high price
while simultaneously inducing type 2 consumers to purchase a product of low quality _z_ 2 at
a lower price, which is equal to their willingness to pay. Suppose that the firm is able to
produce any quality in the quality range [ _z,_ ~~_z_~~ ~~]~~ . To keep the analysis (reasonably) simple,

further assume that the marginal costs of production are constant and identical across all
qualities of product, and are set equal to zero. [10] Finally, we make the following important
assumption (explained below):


_θ_ 1 _z_ 1
_Assumption_ 1 : ~~_z_~~ _>_
_(θ_ 1 _θ_ 2 _)_
          
Note that Assumption 1 is most easily satisfied when the difference between _θ_ 1 and _θ_ 2 is
relatively large.

Let’s look first at a consumer of type 2, a consumer with a low willingness to pay for
quality. What the firm will do is charge this consumer a price that is just low enough for
the consumer to be willing to purchase the low-quality product. From equation (7.30), and
given that _z_ 2 = 0, consumer type 2 will buy _z_ 2 if _p_ 2 ≤ _θ_ 2 _z_ 2, implying a good 2 price of



_p_ 2 _θ_ 2 _z_ 2 (7.31)
=



Now consider a consumer of type 1 with a stronger preference for quality. This consumer
can, of course, buy the low-quality product. So in pricing the high-quality product, the
firm faces the same type of _incentive compatibility constraint_ that we met when discussing
second-degree price discrimination. (There is also the constraint that type 2 consumers buy
the low-quality rather than the high-quality product. See below.) For a type 1 consumer to
buy the high-quality product, it is necessary that:



_θ_ 1 _(z_ 1 _z_ ~~1~~ _)_ _p_ 1 _θ_ 1 _(z_ 2 _z_ ~~1~~ _)_ _p_ 2
  -   - ≥   -   


_θ_ 1 _(z_ 1 _z_ ~~1~~ _)_ _p_ 1 0 (7.32)
  -   - ≥



The first expression in (7.32) says that the consumer surplus that a type 1 consumer
obtains from buying the high-quality product must be greater than or equal to the consumer
surplus that could be obtained if the type 1 consumer bought the low-quality good. The
second expression states that the consumer surplus that a type 1 consumer obtains from
purchasing the high-quality good must be non-negative.



Substituting _p_ 2 = _θ_ 2 _z_ 2 from (7.31) into the first expression in (7.32) we find that:



_p_ 1 _θ_ 1 _z_ 1 _(θ_ 1 _θ_ 2 _)z_ 2 (7.33)
≤  -  


Equation (7.33) says that the maximum price _p_ 1 that can be charged for the high-quality
product isthat the two types of consumers place on quality, and the higher is the quality differential _p_ 1 ≤ _θ_ 1 _z_ 1 − _(θ_ 1 − _θ_ 2 _)z_ 2. This price is greater the higher are the values _θ_ 1 and _θ_ 2
between _z_ 1 and _z_ 2. That is, quality can be priced more highly when it is valued more highly
by all consumers. Further, because the monopolist is effectively competing with itself by
offering two products of different qualities, the monopolist has an incentive to increase
the quality differential between the products, i.e., to make two goods more differentiated.
Doing so weakens the competition between products and allows the firm to increase the
price of its high-quality product. Note that whenconsumers of type 1 receive non-negative surplus when they buy the high-quality good can _p_ 1 ≤ _θ_ 1 _z_ 1 − _(θ_ 1 − _θ_ 2 _)z_ 2 the condition that
now be written as _θ_ 1 _(z_ 1 _z_ ~~1~~ _)_ _p_ 1 0 _(θ_ 1 _θ_ 2 _)z_ 2 _θ_ 1 _z_ ~~1~~ 0. Given our Assumption
         -          - ≥ ⇒          -          - ≥

10 It might be, for example, that the majority of the firm’s costs are set-up costs and that crimping higher
quality products makes lower quality products. Relaxing this assumption doesn’t change much, and
having it makes the analysis a bit easier.
