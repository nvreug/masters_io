Non-Price Vertical Restraints 489


Consider a simple case of a single manufacturer that sells to two downstream retailers.
In addition, we assume, not unreasonably, that while the manufactured product is the same,
the retailers are differentiated at least by location if by no other attribute. In other words,
consumers do not view the purchase of the good at each retailer as perfect substitutes so
that retail competition is not perfect.

In this context, a horizontal externality emerges in promotion and other services. If one
retailer incurs the expense of advertising or providing informational services, it benefits
the other retailer as well. For example, if one Lexus dealer runs Lexus commercials on
local TV, it potentially raises the demand for all Lexus dealers in the area. Similarly, if
one camera store provides information to customers on how to get the best pictures with a
Canon digital camera, those customers may then make their final camera purchase from a
discount Canon retailer who does not offer such services. In short, there is a temptation for
each retailer of a specific brand to free ride on the services provided by other sellers of that
brand. As a result, the level of such services will very likely be too low. Moreover, because
consumers value such services, this externality not only reduces the profit available to the
manufacturer and the retailer, but reduces consumer surplus, as well. [6]

It should be clear how exclusive selling and territorial agreements may remedy the
foregoing externality problems. Effectively such contracts limit the number of sellers of the
manufacturer’s good to just one within any given region or product line. As a result, each
retailer reaps a far greater portion of any benefits its services generate. Further, by giving
the dealer some monopoly power and therefore some monopoly profit, these restrictions
serve to create a real loss if the dealer is found by the manufacturer to be providing too
little service and the contract is terminated. [Klein and Murphy (1988).] Hence, exclusive
selling and territorial restrictions can serve to raise the service level associated with the
manufacturer’s good, thereby raising their joint profit and, depending on price effects,
possibly consumer surplus as well.

Exclusive selling and territorial arrangements have two other potentially important effects
in addition to those just described. Because these contracts result in a single dealer being the
only seller of a specific product in its area, the dealer’s willingness to dump its merchandise
on the market when demand is weak is reduced. This effect can be important in getting
dealers to stock an appropriate amount of the manufacturer’s good in the first place. [7] The
other effect is that an exclusive selling or territorial agreement creates in each region a
monopoly upstream supplier selling to a monopoly downstream retailer. This makes the use
of a two-part tariff or franchise fee attractive as a tool to prevent the double marginalization
and low service problems. Viewed in this light, it should not be surprising that we usually
observe selling and franchise fees in the same contract. [8]

So far we have only considered exclusive selling and territorial arrangements in the
context of a single manufacturer. When there is more than one upstream manufacturer,
these contracts can be used to reduce interbrand competition—to the detriment of consumers.
Suppose that there are two upstream manufacturers producing products that are imperfect
substitutes. Imagine as well that the two manufacturers sell to a competitive retail sector. If
the two manufacturers have identical costs and symmetric demand, then they will set the
same wholesale price _w_ _[C]_, which will also be the retail price because competition eliminates


6 This case differs from those considered in Chapter 17 in which downstream competition helped solve the
double marginalization problem because here, the retailers sell differentiated products.
7 See Chapter 17 for an analysis of uncertain demand and its potentially negative impack on retailer behavior.
8 See Chapter 17 and Lafontaine (1993).

any retail markup. Hence, all downstream retailers will earn zero profit. More importantly,
this means that every increase in the wholesale price will be one-for-one translated into an
equivalent increase in the retail price.

Now, following Rey and Stiglitz (1995) let us imagine that the market for these products
can be divided into regions or territories. Suppose further that each manufacturer grants an
exclusive territory to a retailer in each territory, giving that retailer the exclusive right to
sell its product in that region. As a result, within any given territory each manufacturer’s
product will be sold by a retail monopoly. We know that selling to a monopoly retailer will
give rise to the double-marginalization problem. Why then should the two manufacturers
decide to do this? The answer, in part, is that it softens the intensity of the competition
between the two brands. It does so because it weakens the link between the wholesale price
and the retail price. From the perspective of each retailer, the wholesale price is a cost.
Suppose then that one of the manufacturers raises its wholesale price. For the dealer selling
this product, costs have risen. The dealer will want to pass on this increase by means of a
higher retail price. Competition with the other retailer will limit how much the dealer can
do this. However, now under exclusive territories prices are strategic complements. As the
rival retailer sees the first dealer’s price rising, the rival retailer will see an opportunity to
raise its price without losing customers even though its wholesale cost has not risen. Thus,
when a manufacturer raises its wholesale price it will no longer lose as many customers
as it did when there was competition without exclusive territories. Even though the rival
manufacturer does not raise its wholesale price, the rival retailer does raise the retail price.

Of course, both manufacturers realize the foregoing logic. By each granting an exclusive
territory, they weaken retail interbrand competition, which feeds back to weaker wholesale
competition. As a result, the granting of exclusive territories will lead to higher prices at
both the retail and the wholesale level. Whether the agreement will increase manufacturer
profit is another question. It might not because even though wholesale prices are higher,
the double-marginalization problem means that the quantity sold is lower than it would be
if retailing remained competitive. However, if the double-marginalization problem is not
too large (as would be the case if the two goods are fairly close substitutes), the exclusive
territorial arrangement will also lead to higher upstream profits. If the manufacturing firms
can also adopt a two-part tariff arrangement, the double-marginalization problem can be
overcome altogether. [9]

It may even be possible to use exclusive selling arrangements to achieve monopoly
profit in what would otherwise be a competitive industry. To see this, suppose that the
products of the two manufacturers are perfect substitutes. With a competitive retail sector,
neither manufacturers nor retailers will make any profit. However, suppose that the two
manufacturers coordinate so that within any territory they give the exclusive rights to their
products to the same retailer, each agreeing not to sell to other dealers in that region.
The lucky retailer in any region is thereby transformed into a monopolist who can set the
monopoly retail price. Because monopolies make extra profit, the lucky downstream retailer
in any region will be happy with this scheme.

What about the manufacturers? To some extent, their situation is unchanged. Each still
produces a good for which there is a very close substitute. Hence, competition between the
two should still be fierce. Of course, if this happens, all the monopoly profit will accrue to
the retailer. If competition is less than fierce then the manufacturers can extract some of


9 The mechanism by which exclusive territories soften interbrand price competition described in Rey and
Stiglitz (1995) is conceptually quite similar to the argument in Bonanno and Vickers (1988).


Non-Price Vertical Restraints 491


that profit by means of a two-part tariff. In fact, manufacturers may be able to extract profit
even without using two-part tariffs. For instance, manufacturers can offer an exclusive
sales contract only if the retailer also agrees to a purchase a minimum amount from the
manufacturer even if that manufacturer charges a wholesale price higher than the rival’s
price. This technique—known as a quantity-forcing requirement—again has the effect of
softening wholesale price competition. When each manufacturer does this, each can raise
wholesale price above cost without fear of losing sales to the rival. As a result manufacturers
now earn some profit. [10] Of course, the higher wholesale prices will translate into higher
retail prices. That is, this arrangement does not enhance efficiency. The profit gain of the
manufacturers is more than offset by a reduction in retailer profit and a fall in consumer
surplus. Yet at the same time, it must be recognized that quantity-forcing can also be used
to impose a maximum resale price and, thus limit double-marginalization problems. Thus,
such vertical contracts can be socially beneficial but there clearly is a downside risk in that
they can often be used to soften competition.


18.3 VERTICAL RESTRAINTS AND MARKET FORECLOSURE


Most of the foregoing analysis has considered the potential anticompetitive effects of vertical
restraints in terms of their ability to reduce either interbrand or intrabrand competition.
However, the primary concern in antitrust policy has been the potential for one firm to use
such restraints to foreclose markets entirely to its rivals. In this view, exclusivity restraints
have the potential to be used as a predatory instrument that eliminates either upstream or
downstream rivals similar to the Rasmussen, Ramseyer, and Wiley (1991) model already
noted. Here we focus on two models explicitly set in a vertical context.


18.3.1 Private Contracts


Imagine a monopoly manufacturer selling to _n_ downstream retailers who compete as
Cournot competitors. We will initially assume that _n_ = 2 and, for convenience, also assume
that the only retail cost is the wholesale price _W_ . Ideally, the manufacturer would like to
achieve the monopoly outcome, which we will designate as an output of _Q_ _[M]_ selling at
retail price _P_ _[M]_ . Hence, it would like each retailer to sell _q_ 1 _q_ 2 _Q_ _[M]_ _/_ 2. It could do
this by a quantity-forcing agreement that sells to each the amount = = _Q_ _[M]_ _/_ 2 at a wholesale
price _W_ _[M]_ equal to marginal cost and using a fixed fee _F_ to collect the resultant monopoly
profit for each firm. For example, if the inverse demand is: _P_ = 140 − _Q_ and marginal cost
is _c_ $20, then the manufacturer could enter a fixed-quantity contract of _q_ 1 _q_ 2 30.
Selling at marginal cost = _c_ will then result in a price of _P_ = $80 and operating profit at each = =
retailer of $1,800, which the manufacturer can capture by setting _F_ = $1,800.

However, if the contracts between the manufacturer and each retailer are not public, there
is a difficulty in achieving the above outcome. Suppose that the monopolist signs a contract
with retailer 1 as specified above, i.e., a quantity-forcing agreement in which retailer 1
takes possession of (and sells) 30 units at wholesale price _W_ = _c_ = $20, and agrees to pay
a fixed fee of _F_ 1 = $1800, with a view to doing the same with retailer 2. The problem is
that having signed this contract with retailer 1, the manufacturer will now no longer wish


10 Note that in the final equilibrium the quantity constraint does not need to be binding.


492 Contractual Relations Between Firms


to do the same with retailer 2. Why? Because we know from studying the Cournot model
in Chapter 9 that retailer 2’s best response function with _W_ = _c_ = $20 is:




[1]

2 2

[=][ 60][ −] _[q]_ [1]



2 [∗] [=] [140][ −] 2 _[W]_




[1]

[140][ −] _[c]_
2 2

[=]




[ −] _[c]_

2 - _[q]_ 2 [1]



_q_ 2 [∗]




[ −] _[W]_

2 - _[q]_ 2 [1]



(18.1)
2



Hence, given an output of 30 units by retailer 1, retailer 2’s best response is _not_ 30 units but
45 units when _W_ = _c_ = $20. Thus, in its secret dealing with retailer 2, the manufacturer
would now wish to sell a quantity-forcing contract for 45 units. Combined with the 30
units sold by retailer 1, this will drive the retail price to $65 at which price, retailer 2 will
earn $2,025 in operating profit (given that it too buys at cost _c_ ) that again will be collected
by a fixed fee _F_ 2 $2,025. By exploiting retailer 1 who now suffers a $450 loss, the
manufacturer has raised its profit to $2025 = + $1800 = $3825; $225 more than the $3,600
pure monopoly profit. The result would obviously be the same if the manufacturer had first
signed an agreement with retailer 2.

Of course, each retailer can foresee the possibility of the manufacturer’s exploitation. As
a result, each will be reluctant to sign any contract calling for half of the monopoly output
and a fixed fee of $1800 knowing that the manufacturer may secretly try to undermine
this deal in its negotiations with the rival retailer. In fact, a little intuition suggests that the
only credible outcome is for the manufacturer to offer contracts that essentially duplicate
the Cournot outcome with each retailer selling 40 units. By extension, the equilibrium
outcome with _n_ = 3 retailers would be that each sells 30 units. More generally, our result
from Chapter 9 that with linear inverse demand of _P_ = _A_ - _Q_, and marginal cost _c_ the

_[A]_ _[c]_



symmetric Cournot outcome with _n_ firms is that each produces _[A]_ [ −] _[c]_



symmetric Cournot outcome with _n_ firms is that each produces

_n_ 1 [units, implies that in]
this example, each retailer sells 120 _/(n_ + 1 _)_ so that total output increases as equilibrium, +
_n_, gets larger and larger and with it, so does the profit loss the manufacturer suffers due to
its lack of credibility. The Reality Checkbox concerning the contract between Macy’s and
Martha Stewart illustrates that fears of producer secret deals are quite legitimate.

In this setting, the attraction of an exclusive retail contract that designates just one
retailer as the manufacturer’s selling agent is clear. Committing to selling through just one
retailer prevents the manufacturer from exploiting its downstream partner. As a result, it can
obtain a contract to sell the monopoly output of 60 units exclusively to one retailer leading
to the monopoly price of $80 and monopoly profit of $3,600, again collected through a
fixed fee _F_ . [11]


18.3.2 Slotting Allowances and Exclusion


As noted above, vertical restraints can be imposed on either the upstream or downstream
firm and while early attention focused on the restrictions imposed on dealers, increasing
attention has been paid to the restraints on the upstream firm’s behavior. Such restraints
have become somewhat more common in recent years with the rise of very large retail
chains such as Wal-Mart, whose size gives them significant if not dominant bargaining
power with their suppliers. One manifestation of such retailer power is the increasing use of
slotting allowances or fees by which retailers claim an up front payment from the producer
in return for shelf space.


11 This basic argument was first presented by Hart and Tirole (1990) and refined and extended by O’Brien
and Shaffer (1992). See also Comanor and Rey (2000).


Non-Price Vertical Restraints 493

In the context of large, imperfectly competitive retailers, Shaffer (1991) has argued that
such slotting fees may be a means by which these firms soften both downstream and
upstream price competition. Roughly, the argument is that the fees enable the retailers to
pay high wholesale prices that, in turn, limit the incentive to cut retail prices at the margin.
Essentially, having collected their profit up front via the slotting fees means that the retailers
compete less aggressively at the margin on price.

In addtion, there is again a major concern that slotting allowances will lead to market
exclusion. Recall our observation in Chapter 12 that firms with market power will typically
be willing to spend more to protect it than an entrant will be willing to spend to break into
the market. Slotting fees may be an explicit illustration of this point in which upstream
producers with market power outbid smaller entrants for the scarce shelf space. [12] In this
case, smaller producers are foreclosed access to the retail market.


12 For evidence on this point, see the Federal Trade Commission report, _Slotting Allowances in the Retail_
_Grocery Industry: Selected Case Studies in Five Product Categories_, 2003.


494 Contractual Relations Between Firms


Alternatively, slotting fees can be part of an exclusive relation that forecloses access to
manufactured goods to some retailers, as shown by Marx and Shaffer (2007). Their model is
one of three stages. In the first stage, retailers offer contracts to producers with three critical
parameters. The first is the slotting fee _S_ that must be paid to the retailer immediately
upon the contract’s signing. The second and third parameters are the familiar fixed fee _F_
and wholesale price _W_ paid to the manufacturer but _only_ if the retailer actually sells any
positive amount so that it actually buys goods from the producer.

To get a rough sense of the Marx and Shaffer (2007) model, return to our Cournot
example above. Because demand is given by _P_ = 140 − _Q_, and the producer’s marginal
cost is _c_ = $20, we know that the monopoly outcome for an integrated firm and hence
the overall profit maximum is _Q_ _[M]_ = 60 and _P_ _[M]_ = $80, so that the maximum industry
profit is _�_ _[M]_ = $3,600. To achieve this symmetrically, contracts in which each firm faces
a wholesale price _W_ = $50 is required. At this wholesale price, substitution into the best
response function (18.1) along with the symmetry requirement thatfirms producing 30 units so that total output is 60 and the retail price is $80 as in the _q_ 1 = _q_ 2 results in both
integrated monopoly case. Note that if this equilibrium were to occur, each retailer would
earn an operating profit of _(_ $80 − $50 _)_ × 30 = $900. Likewise, the upstream manufacturer
would earn an operating profit of _(_ $50 − $20 _)_ × 60 = $1800. How this total of $3,600 in
operating profit is ultimately shared will then depend on the slotting allowances _S_ and lump
sum procurement fee _F_ in each contract.

In considering the determination of _S_ and _F_, we need to recognize two features of the
bargaining environment. First, the retailers have the initiative. Each makes a “take it or
leave it” contract offer to the manufacturer. Hence, the manufacturer will always say yes
to a contract that raises its profit above what would be earned if it says no. Second, the
manufacturer does not have to say yes to both retail contracts. It can choose one and not the
other in which case we have one retailer foreclosed.

For example, suppose that as suggested above each retailer offers a contract to the
manufacturerwith a wholesale price _W_ = $50, a slotting fee _S_ = $500, and a lump sum
fee paid to the manufacturer _F_ = $100. Acceptance of both of these contracts by the
manufacturer will result in each retailer ordering and selling 30 units, earning $900 in
operating profit plus $500 in slotting allowances less $100 in fixed production fees for a
total profit at each retailer of $1,300. The manufacturer would then earn an operating profit
of $1,800 plus $200 in production fees less $1,000 in slotting payments for a net profit
of $1,000.

So, if the manufacturer accepts both contracts, the outcome mimics the integrated
monopoly maximum. Yet this _cannot be_ an equilibrium because each retailer would have
an incentive to raise its slotting fee. Suppose for example that retailer 1 raises _S_ 1 to $540.
If the manufacturer accepts this and continues to supply retailer 2 as well, the only change
is a transfer of $40 in net profit to retailer 1 at the expense of the manufacturer who
now earns just $960. Of course, the manufacturer could reject retailer 1 and work only
with retailer 2 with _W_ 2 $50 _, S_ 2 $500 and _F_ 2 $100 as before. In that case though,
retailer 2 becomes a retail monopoly who, with = = _W_ =2 $50, will sell 45 units at a price
of $95 each, implying a total operating profit of $1,350 for the manufacturer. In addition, =
the manufacturer earns a $100 lump sum fee from retailer 2 but pays a $500 slotting
fee as before. Hence, rejecting retailer 1 and working only with retailer 2 will cause the
manufacturer’s net profit to fall to $950 − $10 less than if it accepts retailer 1’s offer and
works with both. Knowing the manufacturer will accept, retailer 1 will raise its slotting fee
to $540 or even higher.


Non-Price Vertical Restraints 495


Of course, retailer 2 also understands the situation. It too has an incentive to request
higher slotting fees perhaps even higher than $540. In this regard, it is instructive to consider
the case in which both retailers set _S_ 1 _S_ 2 $550. With all other contract features the
same, the manufacturer continues to sell 30 units to each retailer and earn total operating = =
profit of $1,800. It also collects a combined $200 in lump sum payments but now pays
$1,100 in slotting fees so that its total net profit is $900. Yet again the manufacturer cannot
do better by accepting only one of the contracts. That one lucky retailer would have a
monopoly and sell 45 units. The manufacturer then earns $1,350 in operating profit plus

496 Contractual Relations Between Firms


$100 as a lump sum less $550 in slotting fees for a net profit of $900—exactly the same as
if it accepts both contracts.

The foregoing example is no coincidence. In any conceivable equilibrium in which the
manufacturer accepts the contract offer of both firms, it must be the case that it would earn
exactly the same profit by accepting only one of those contracts and letting the winner act as
a retail monopolist. Otherwise, at least one retailer will want to demand more in slotting fees.

The insight of the Marx and Shaffer (2007) analysis readily follows because it is clear
that an equilibrium in which the manufacturer supplies both retailers is not really possible.
While the manufacturer may be indifferent between supplying one or both retailers, the
retailers themselves are not. Suppose, for instance, that we reach the point just described
with each retailer setting _Si_ $550 _, Wi_ $50 _,_ and _Fi_ $100. While the manufacturer
neither gains nor loses if it supplies only one retailer under these terms, the retailer who = = =
gets the monopoly clearly gains. While a downstream duopolist earns net profit of $1350,
a retail monopoly earns $2475. The downstream firms will therefore compete for the
manufacturer’s exclusive supply by offering more generous contracts.

In our symmetric example, equilibrium is reached when each retailer charges a slotting
fee of _Si_ 0; a wholesale price of _Wi_ $20; and a lump sum payment of _Fi_ $3600.
More generally, one retailer is likely to have some cost or other advantage over its = = =
rival. Suppose then that retailer 1 can generate $3700 in operating profit when it buys
at _W_ 1 $20 as opposed to the $3600 assumed for retailer 2. In that case, competition
between the two retailers to be the exclusive dealer will end with retailer 2 offering =
a slotting fee of _S_ 2 0 _W_ 2 $20 and _F_ 2 $3600, while retailer 1 wins the contract
with _S_ 1 $99.99 _W_ =1 ; $20 and = _F_ 1; $3700. Retailer 1’s advantage allows it to win the =

Specifically, retailer 1 cannot win with the contract _S_ 1 $0 _W_ 1 $20 and _F_ 1 $3600.01
even though that results in the same manufacturer net profit because that contract—once = ; = =
it is signed—permits retailer 1 to operate profitably even if firm 2 enters and produces

exclusive manufacturer-dealer relation. In general, this exclusivity will imply a welfare
loss, e.g., if the two retailers sell differentiated products so that variety falls when one
retailer is excluded. In sum, while exclusive contracts can promote services and efficiency,
they can also be used to soften price competition and foreclose markets.


18.4 VERTICAL RESTRICTIONS IN AFTERMARKETS


The vertical restrictions that we have examined so far primarily reflect constraints on the
sale of the same product as it moves through the chain from the upstream producer to
the downstream dealer. In recent years, a different kind of vertical restriction has caught
the interest of economists and policy makers alike—one that is closely related to the tying
arrangements that we considered in Chapter 13. This restriction effectively involves an
excusive selling arrangement in what are known as aftermarkets.

The key legal case in the aftermarkets debate is the _Kodak_ case. The specifics of
that case are as follows. Kodak was one of a number of manufacturers of micrographic


Non-Price Vertical Restraints 497


equipment—used for creating, viewing, and printing microfilm and microfiche—and office
copiers. This was the primary, or foremarket. However, Kodak also provided repair parts and
services to these machines through a nationwide network of technicians. Kodak advertised
the quality of this network as a means of persuading consumers to buy its machines in the
first place. Because no one needs micrographic or copier parts and services if they have
not already purchased a micrographic machine or copier, the parts and services market is
referred to as the aftermarket.

Just as in the foremarket, Kodak had competition in the aftermarket. There were many
independent firms providing parts and services to firms using Kodak’s office machines.
However, to the extent that these independent firms needed replacement parts, they relied on
Kodak to provide them. Kodak was happy enough to do so until it lost a service contract with
Computer Service Corporation (CSC) to an independent firm, Image Technical Services
(ITS). After that, Kodak announced a new policy of not providing replacement parts to any
independent service provider. Effectively, Kodak imposed a monopoly in the servicing of
its machines by exclusively selling the necessary parts to only Kodak technicians. Without
those parts, independent repair services would find it impossible to make such repairs. As
Kodak enforced the new policy more and more strictly, ITS and other independents filed a
lawsuit contesting Kodak’s action.

In court Kodak asked for a summary dismissal of the plaintiffs’ case. Kodak’s basic
argument ran along the following lines. There were many other producers of photographic
office equipment implying that Kodak faced competition in the foremarket. As a result,
Kodak argued it could not possibly exert monopoly power in the aftermarket. Before making
a purchase in the foremarket, consumers consider the full cost of, say, a copier—both the
price at the initial time of purchase and the price of services later. If Kodak were to
try to charge a high price in the aftermarket for services, it would only attract foremarket
customers if it reduced its machine prices by a corresponding amount. Hence, Kodak argued
that it could not impose monopoly pricing in the aftermarket. The Supreme Court rejected
Kodak’s contention. Later, a jury turned in a verdict against Kodak.

The Kodak case was followed by a number of similar cases. Again, the central issue
is whether and how a firm can exercise monopoly power in the aftermarket if it does not
have such power in the foremarket. To illustrate the issues, consider the following simple
example in which we assume the interest rate _r_ is zero so that discounting can be ignored.
Two firms, Kodak and Lexsung, each sell a machine that lasts potentially for two periods,
which is the same time frame as the typical consumer’s horizon. While the machines may
look physically different they are identical in the eyes of consumers, each of whom values
the services of the machine at $50 per period. We designate the prices of a new Kodak and
Lexsung machine as _P_ _[K]_ [and] _[ P][ L]_ [, respectively. Competition is in prices (Bertrand), so the]

will fall to marginal cost, which we here assume to be _PM_ _[K]_ _M_

While each machine runs perfectly well during the first period, there is a 50 percent [=] _[ P][ L]_ [=][ $50.]
chance that each will break down and need repairs in the second period. In principle,
consumers whose machine breaks down can do one of two things. They can either return to
the foremarket and buy a new machine for $50 (with a view to selling it as a used machine
after one period) or, they can buy repair services from a competitive repair market. In this
case, repair prices could never exceed $25—the net cost of buying either a new or used
machine. However, we will rule out the first alternative by assuming that once a particular
machine has been bought, consumers are “locked in” to that brand, perhaps because they
have made investments in training to use that brand or because they have bought peripheral

498 Contractual Relations Between Firms


equipment that only works with that brand. This “lock-in” means that for the 50 percent of
consumers whose machine breaks down, the only option is to have it repaired. Moreover, as
in the original Kodak case, repair requires Kodak parts. That is, the “lock in” effect applies
to both the original machine and repair services and it is the latter that enable Kodak to
monopolize the repair of its own machines. Initially, however, we assume a competitive
repair market for both types of machines and, for convenience, a marginal cost of 0 for
repairs. Hence, competition implies that the initial repair price is also zero.

Kodak’s basic defense is easy to see. Suppose that at the start of the first period Kodak
had imposed an aftermarkets restriction that only Kodak technicians can repair Kodak
machines. Given that they would be locked in after purchasing a machine, and given that
in the face of such a breakdown, a Kodak consumer would be willing to pay as much as
$50 for a one-period repair, Kodak could in principle charge very close to that amount for
its monopoly repair service. However, any first-period buyer of a Kodak machine would
then recognize that if he or she buys a machine from Kodak at price _P_ _[K]_ [the buyer will later]



then recognize that if he or she buys a machine from Kodak at price _PM_ _[K]_ [the buyer will later]

face with probability 0.5 a second-period repair cost of $50. Thus, the anticipated price of a

will lose $25 on every new machine it will sell. To be sure, it will later earn $50 in repair
profit on half of these but this does no more than just offset the loss incurred on every new
machine. More generally, the simple analysis suggests that any increase in Kodak’s repair
price translates one-for-one into an offsetting reduction in its machine price with the result
that monopolizing the repair market does not increase its profit.

There are, however, counter arguments to Kodak’s argument. The simplest is that there
are likely some consumers who do not fully incorporate subsequent repair costs into their
equipment purchasing calculations. This assumption might not seem terribly realistic in the
context of our simple two-period example. Yet the reality of durable machines is that they
often last for far more than two periods and there are multiple repair issues that can arise. As
a result, it may be difficult for some consumers to form rigorous expectations of later repair
costs and they may therefore just ignore these. Moreover, even if consumers can look far
ahead over the lifetime of a machine they would still need a fair bit of information to make
a sensible forecast of later repair costs. If that information can only be acquired at great
cost, then it may not be worth getting so that again, consumers ignore later repair expenses.

Take our example above. Initially, both Kodak and Lexsung are selling their machines at
a price of $50 each and consumers face a later repair price of 0. Let us assume that in this
market outcome each firm serves 100 new customers each period. Suppose that if Kodak
now monopolizes the market for repairing its machines and sets a price of $50 for repairs it
will lose 98 but not all 100 of its new machine customers unless it also lowers its price by an
amount equal to the expected repair cost of $25. Losing those 98 customers does not really
hurt Kodak, however, because in the initial equilibrium it was not earning any profit from
them in any case. In contrast, Kodak will earn an average of $50 of extra profit from the two
consumers who do remain. It will earn five times that amount if in contrast to retaining only
2 percent of its customers it retains 10 percent. Thus, if information is incomplete for at
least some consumers then monopolization of the aftermarket can be profitable. Moreover,
Gabaix and Laibson (2006) suggest that the presence of some unsophisticated consumers

_M_ [falls to $25, so that] _[ P]_ _M_ _[ K]_

can interact with the lock-in effects just described to make firms unwilling to announce low
aftermarket prices even when they can and even when competition is strong. [13]

A second motivation to pursue the aftermarket monopoly is sometimes referred to as
installed base opportunism. Even if we assume that the information issue is not important
so that consumers who have not yet purchased a machine can incorporate aftermarket prices
into their purchase decisions, Kodak can still take advantage of those who have already
bought its machine. That is, we may envision the market as one with waves of overlapping
cohorts of consumers so that at any time there are new consumers about to buy a machine
for a two-year horizon and old consumers who bought a new machine one year earlier and
are now only seeking a final year’s worth of service from the machine. Imagine now that
these old consumers bought the Kodak machine for the initial equilibrium price of $50
and that it was only at the end of the first period that Kodak instituted its monopoly repair
strategy. While new machine sales of Kodak machines will have to be at a price of $25
per unit, these older consumers have already paid $50 and cannot undo that purchase. They
will be taken by surprise by the Kodak move and, as they are locked into the Kodak brand,
they will be forced to pay the higher Kodak repair prices.

However, the gain from exploiting its previously installed base is essentially a one-time
gain. It only extracts profit from those consumers who paid an initial high machine price
_before_ Kodak monopolized the repair service (or before it exercised its monopoly power)
and therefore expected to pay only the marginal cost. Once Kodak makes its monopolizing
move, all future consumers will purchase machines elsewhere unless Kodak reduces the
price or unless it restores competitive pricing for its services. Moreover, such opportunism
is likely to have a negative impact on Kodak’s reputation in the foremarket. Unless the
opportunity for future profits is small—perhaps because the market is in decline—the
short-run gain may not be worth this cost.

At the same time, it is important to recognize that to the extent Kodak keeps prices close
to marginal cost, that temptation to exploit those second-stage consumers who are locked
in will always be present. That is, it will be difficult if not impossible for Kodak to commit
credibly to a policy of always setting its repair price at marginal cost. There is no profit
foregone if one loses customers who are only paying a marginal cost price while there
is a bound to be some profit available from charging those locked in customers a price
above cost, but this can only be accomplished if Kodak has monopoly power in the repairs
market. If it does, Borenstein, MacKie-Mason, and Netz (2000) demonstrate that the only
aftermarket prices to which Kodak can commit to keep constant through time are prices
that exceed marginal cost—and that therefore eliminate this temptation. The equilibrium
can then be one of inefficiently high aftermarket prices and somewhat inefficiently low
foremarket prices, with the result that consumers replace their machines too frequently.

In short, whenever there are lock-in effects, the potential for aftermarket profits via
exclusionary restraints cannot be ruled out by economic theory as Kodak originally asked. [14]


13 In the Gabaix and Laibson (2006), the interaction between the lock-in and the presence of some
unsophisticated consumers induces firms to charge super-competitive prices to aftermarket products, e.g.,
hotel phone use and rental car insurance, and low prices for the foremarket goods, rooms, and rented cars.
14 Chen and Ross (1993) explore the case in which the foremarket is imperfectly competitve so that firms
can use the aftermarket products as part of a tying price discrimination strategy of the type discussed in
Chapter 5. Note too that Miao (2010) shows that if consumers are myopic and firms are simultaneously
active in both the foremarket and the aftermarket, Kodak’s argument is invalid because it implies a pricing
inconsistency.


500 Contractual Relations Between Firms


At the same time, it is prudent to recognize that there are practical limits on firms pursuing
such profits. Companies may be reluctant to exploit any aftermarket power for fear of the
damage this brings to their reputation—a damage that may extend to all their products
and not just those for which there are important aftermarkets. Consumers may be able to
avoid being locked in by renting instead of buying. Firms may compete by offering more
complete information or long-term service contracts. Further, contrary to our simplifying
assumptions, access to a used equipment market may place a further constraint on any
aftermarket monopoly profits.

Because the aftermarket scenario applies to a wide variety of products—automobiles,
consumer appliances, office and medical equipment, to name just a few—the _Kodak_ case

has deservedly received much attention from academics, lawyers, and policy-makers. The
consensus that seems to have emerged over time is that while it was right to deny Kodak’s
initial request for dismissal, i.e., economic theory does not rule out gains from aftermarket
monopolization even when the foremarket is highly competitive, it is difficult in practice
for the courts to determine clearly the extent of consumer harm in such cases. As a result,
application of the _Kodak_ doctrine has waned over time. (See Reality Checkpoint.)


18.5 PUBLIC POLICY TOWARD VERTICAL RESTRAINTS


Non-price vertical agreements can have both positive and negative effects. Accordingly, a
“rule of reason” approach has dominated the legal cases in this area. The outcome in the
courts typically reflects the court’s balancing of the conflicting pro- and anti-competitive
forces. Not all analysts agree on the wisdom of this approach. For some, such as Posner
(1981), the potential efficiency gains of exclusive selling and territorial agreements are
likely to be sufficiently large that all such vertical restrictions ought to be considered _per_
_se_ legal under the antitrust laws. The argument is essentially that vertical restrictions must
at least benefit the upstream and downstream firms that have agreed to such restraints.
They may, as we have seen, benefit consumers as well. Attempting to use a rule of reason
and judge each situation on a case-by-case method will, in this view, be very difficult and
produce a large number of inconsistent and quite possibly wrong decisions. Accordingly,
the wisest course for antitrust policy is simply to let all vertical restrictions alone. The US
Justice Department came close to adopting such a view in its Vertical Restraints Guidelines
of 1985, and there was little prosecution of vertical arrangements for the next several years.
However, those guidelines were rejected in 1993 and the antitrust authorities have since
taken a still tolerant but somewhat less generous attitude towards vertical restraints.

A similar fluctuation in policy has been observed in Europe. Up until the late 1990s, the
approach taken by the European Union was largely one of condemnation for any type of nonprice vertical restraint in general, coupled with broad exemptions for specific arrangements,
especially franchise contracts. However, in 1999 as economic integration became more
complete, the European Union adopted its own Vertical Restraint Guidelines that applied a
much more lenient treatment of vertical restraints again based on a rule-of-reason approach.

A good bit of tolerance toward non-price restrictions is probably warranted. While
there are many well justified concerns about the potential for these restraints to exert
anticompetitive effects, the great bulk of the empirical evidence is that such restraints are
usually good for producers and have either positive or at least no negative consequences
for consumers. [15] Moreover, when studies do find negative consequences for consumers,
it is usually because they find a rise in retail prices. Yet this may occur for benign
reasons. Recall the free-riding problem in our earlier _Tylenol_ example. Because the cost
of _Tylenol’s_ advertising is reflected in its price, the more free-riding is a serious problem,
the more we would expect Johnson & Johnson to seek an exclusive dealing contract or
other vertical restraint. In other words, it is likely that we will observe vertical restrictions
most in precisely those markets where manufacturers have to make serious investments in
advertising or quality improvement that need to be protected. Because the expense of those
investments will be reflected in the product price, this also means that the use of those
restrictions will be associated with higher prices. Yet the restriction is not the cause of the


15 See Lafontaine and Slade (2007).


502 Contractual Relations Between Firms


higher price and its use does not necessarily hurt consumers. When the possible endogeneity
of vertical restraints is recognized, the accumulated empirical evidence implies even more
strongly that the use of such restraints has generally been beneficial.

Sometimes non-price vertical restraints are imposed by the government and sometimes
these restraints have a negative effect. For example, in many states, independent opticians
have been prohibited from fitting contact lenses. Instead, lens wearers have been required
to see an ophthalmologist or optometrist, thereby effectively tying the purchase of lenses
to the services of these professionals. Hass-Wilson (1987) found that such policies raised
consumer prices without any improvement in quality. They also diminished the variety
of consumer choices. Such findings are not unusual in the case of state-imposed vertical
restrictions. [16]

The efforts of policy makers to balance anticompetitive effects such as entry deterrence
against the efficiency gains that exclusive dealing can generate are illustrated by a US
case involving the two principal manufacturers of the water pumps used by fire engines.
Hale Products, Inc., and Waterous Company, Inc. were the pump-makers in question. Each
manufactured the water pump that is installed on fire trucks in the United States. Each sold
its pumps directly to the makers of such fire trucks through exclusive dealing contracts.
Those fire truck manufacturers who bought from Hale agreed not to buy from any other
pump-maker, and likewise for those who agreed to purchase their pumps from Waterous.
In determining the effect of these agreements, the FTC noted that together the two firms
accounted for 90 percent of the US market for water pumps and had done so for nearly fifty
years, with the remainder accounted for by a small third firm, W. S. Darley & Company.
During that time, no new entrant had come into the market. This was taken as evidence
by the FTC that the exclusive dealing agreements had effectively blocked such entry. In
addition, the FTC alleged that the agreements also worked to reduce competition between
Hale and Waterous. Documents were presented indicating that each firm realized that so
long as it dealt only with its half of the engine manufacturers, it did not need to fear
competition from the other. Further, the FTC noted that neither pump-maker would wish to
cheat on this tacit agreement because such cheating would be quickly detected. Waterous
would know immediately that if it lost a pump customer it was likely won by Hale. The
same would be true for Hale. Ultimately, the FTC prevailed and the two firms agreed to
cease the exclusive dealing arrangements. [17]

The above procedure illustrates how a rule of reason operates in practice. The threshold
issue is the fraction of the market such agreements cover. Unless that fraction is large,
the agreements are presumed not to weaken competition in any meaningful way and are
therefore deemed legal. Even if the threshold is reached however, that merely sets the
stage for subsequent investigation. The question then becomes whether the restrictions
are substantially harmful to competition. Here, factors such as the history of entry, the
behavior of prices, and the potential for free-riding problems need to be examined. This is
a complicated process and the _per se_ presumption of legality suggested by Posner (1981) is
understandably tempting. Our view is that there are sufficient grounds for concern that the
continued use of a rule of reason approach is warranted despite the difficulties that entails.


16 States occasionally issue blanket prohibitions on vertical restraints, e.g., bans on direct ownership of
service stations by oil refineries. Such restraints on organizational choices can create difficulties. See, e.g.,
Blass and Carlton (2001). See Steiner (1985) for a general discussion of vertical restraint policy.

18.6 A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF FRANCHISING AND
DIVISIONALIZATION


Our discussion of vertical relations has often included references to franchising. In fact,
probably the bulk of vertical restrictions arise in the context of franchising agreements
because these cover a large fraction of retail sales, roughly over a third. As a result,
franchising merits some individual attention of its own.

There are two basic types of franchising agreements. Under the traditional type observed
with soft drinks, gasoline, and car dealerships, the upstream franchisor sells its branded
product to the downstream franchisee, which then resells this good either to other firms
or consumers. More recently, a second type of franchising known as business format
franchising has emerged. Here, the franchisee buys the right to a brand name and a complete
business plan. Food establishments such as McDonald’s and hotel chains such as Marriott
are examples of this latter type. Business format franchising has grown rapidly and now
accounts for over a quarter of all franchising. [18]

The proliferation of franchised outlets reflects a number of forces. To a large extent,
it reflects an effort to internalize the externalities noted above. An advertisement by the
McDonald’s parent corporation will benefit all McDonald’s restaurants. This effect may be
particularly important in the modern era of brand proliferation and the resulting consumer
need for recognizable brand names that reduce uncertainty about quality and save on
shopping time. For the same reasons, franchising also permits the exploitation of scale
economies in advertising and the purchase of supplies. However, even after the decision
to establish new outlets has been made, a franchisor still has an organizational choice
to make. In particular, it has to determine whether it wishes to operate the outlet as a
company-owned operation managed by a salaried employee or as an independent franchise
run by a profit-maximizing owner.

There are two countervailing forces that affect this choice. On the one hand, a salaried
employee running a company-owned outlet may not have strong incentives to put forth
effort and maximize profit whereas the franchisee as residual claimant does have incentives
much more closely aligned with those of the franchisor. On the other hand, the companyowned outlet can perhaps be more easily monitored and controlled to make sure that it
works cooperatively with others in pursuit of the franchisor’s goals. In contrast, while
an independent franchise owner may have a strong incentive to innovate and earn the
maximum profit yielding more for its owner, we need to recognize that maximizing the
outlet’s profit and maximizing the franchisor’s profit can be two different matters. For
example, an independent franchisee may not support the promotional and service efforts
that maximize the joint profit of all the company’s outlets but, instead, free-ride on the
efforts of others. Of course, if all outlets do this, promotional and service levels may fall far
below the level that maximizes joint profit.

We have seen that vertical restrictions such as exclusive territorial rights may help resolve
the incentive conflicts between franchisors and franchisees. Further, by granting a local
territorial monopoly, the franchisor may induce franchisee owners to pay a higher initial
franchise fee. However, once that fee has been collected, a further potential conflict arises
between franchisor and franchisee. The franchising firm may have an incentive to open
additional outlets that crowd in on the territory of the initial franchisee.


18 See Lafontaine (1993), Lafontaine and Shaw (1999) and Blair and Lafontaine (2005).


504 Contractual Relations Between Firms


There are at least three reasons for a franchisor to wish to have a large number of
franchisees. From a spatial perspective, operating many outlets means that the franchisor is
better able to meet the specific preferences of each individual customer. This enables the
franchise operation to extract more surplus by charging each customer an amount much
closer to a customer’s maximum willingness to pay for the most preferred variety. In short,
operating many outlets may enhance the franchisor’s ability to price discriminate.

In addition, the operation of a large number of outlets may be a means for firm to
overcome asymmetric information and attendant moral hazard problems. With just one
outlet, the franchisor cannot tell whether a low-profit outcome is due to bad luck—which
could happen to anyone—or to the outlet’s poor management. With many outlets, it is less
likely that they all will have bad luck at the same time. Hence, the average performance
of a large number of outlets may serve as a benchmark against which to measure the
performance of each franchise individually.

Both of these are perfectly plausible explanations for why franchising is a popular
business model and also for why companies might wish to establish various operating
divisions as independent profit centers. A third motivation is also possible, however. It is
that, operating a large number of independent franchises (or divisions) may be a way for
a firm to commit to a large total output. This is the approach taken by Baye, Crocker, and
Ju (1996) who analyze the implications of this motive for franchising, or divisionalization,
using a two-stage model. In the first stage, there are two independent franchisors, each
of which chooses the number of independent franchises that it wishes to establish. In the
second stage, the franchises from both franchisors compete in a Cournot quantity-setting
game. [19]

Suppose that the franchises of both firms produce a homogeneous product at a constant
marginal cost of _c_ . The inverse demand for the product in the downstream market is
described by our usual linear function, _P_ = _A_ - _BQ_, where _Q_ is total market output.

In stage one of the game, let _n_ 1 and _n_ 2 denote the number of franchisees established
by franchisors 1 and 2, respectively. A franchisor incurs a sunk cost _K_ in the first stage
when it sets up a franchise. In stage two, all of the franchisees act as independent players
in a simultaneous-move Cournot game. By that we mean that each franchise acts like an
independent profit-maximizer.

To solve this game we begin with the stage-two competition. Let _qij_ denote the output
chosen by the _i_ th franchise of firm _j_, where _i_ runs from 1 to _nj_ and _j_ is equal to 1 or 2. Let
_Q_ _ij_ describe the total output of all franchises except the _i_ th franchise of firm _j_ . The profit

 of this franchise _πij_ can then be written as

_πij(qij, Q_  - _ij)_ = [ _A_  - _B(Q_  - _ij_ + _qij)_ ] _qij_  - _cqij_ (18.2)



_qij_ .




- _nj_



where total market output _Q_ is equal to



�2



_j_ =1



_i_ =1



The _i_ th franchise of firm _j_ chooses output _qij_ to maximize its profit. This, of course,
requires setting its marginal revenue to its marginal cost. This implies in turn that the
optimal output of any franchise _qij_ [∗] [satisfies]



_ij_ [∗] [satisfies]



_A_ - _BQ_ - _ij_ - 2 _Bqij_ [∗] [=] _[ c]_ (18.3)



19 Rather than franchises, these could be divisions of the company provided that the divisions are established
as independent profit centers.


Non-Price Vertical Restraints 505


Because all franchises are identical, they must all choose the same optimal output in
equilibrium—that is, _qij_ [∗]

_n_ 1 _n_ 2 franchises in total, [=] _[ q]_ _Q_ [∗] [for all] _ij_ must equal _[ i, j]_ [. This greatly simplifies matters. Because there are] _(n_ 1 _n_ 2 1 _)q_ [∗] . Substitution into equation
(18.3) then yields + - + 

_A_ _c_
_q_ [∗]  - (18.4)

with respect to _n_ 1 and setting it to zero. This technique assumes that we can ignore the constraint that _n_ 1

506 Contractual Relations Between Firms


Equation (18.9) shows that the greater is _(A_  - _c)_ and/or the smaller is _K_, the greater
is the number of franchises chosen by firm 1 and firm 2 in stage one of the game. Recall
that the difference between price and cost is _(A_ - _c)/_ 2 if the market is monopolized. One
implication of this model is that firms will create more franchises the greater the price-cost
differential would be under a monopoly. However, having more franchises is tantamount to
having more Cournot-type units, and this brings us closer to the competitive equilibrium.
Hence, the greater the possible markup under a monopoly, the greater the number of
franchises the two firms operate, and the more closely they end up approximating the
competitive equilibrium. The firms are locked in a “prisoners’ dilemma” in which the best
response of each firm acting separately is not optimal from the standpoint of the two firms
collectively. The firms independently open up more franchises than they would if they
cooperated or colluded.

In short, an additional reason for franchise growth may be that it permits aggressive
efforts to claim market share. This encourages firms both to adopt the franchise format
and, having chosen that format, to expand the number of franchisees. This results in many
more franchises than the number that would maximize industry profits. Moreover, while
expanding the number of franchises may be hard on firm profits, it can be especially hard
on the profits earned by each individual franchisee. This reflects another case of incentive
conflicts that beset vertical relations. [21]

18.7 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: EXCLUSIVE DEALING IN
THE US BEER INDUSTRY


The impact of exclusive dealing and exclusive territorial contracts has been the subject
of many studies. The emerging consensus from these studies is that such contracts
are beneficial, both for firms and for consumers, when they are not mandated by the


21 While we have cast our example in terms of the operation of independent franchisees, it could equally
well be cast in terms of operating independent divisions such as the different divisions run by major auto
makers such as GM and Ford. Here again, the outcome may be too many divisions from the viewpoint of
maximizing industry profits, but with no real way for any one car firm to reduce the number of divisions
unilaterally. This may ultimately be why in the wake of the Great Recession and industry reorganization
of 2007–09, GM eliminated its _Saturn_ and _Pontiac_ divisions and Ford eliminated its _Mercury_ division.


Non-Price Vertical Restraints 507


government but instead, the result of private negotiations. A recent study by Tim Sass
(2005) on exclusive dealing in the US domestic beer market is an example of the kind of
study that finds support for private vertical contracts.

The US has a three-tiered beer market. At one end of the stream are the beer producers
or breweries, such as Anheuser-Busch (AB—now Anheuser-Busch InBev), Miller, and
Coors. In the case of a foreign beer, the domestic firm importing that beer plays the role of
a producer. Besides producing the beer, brewers also engage in a good bit of advertising
and product promotion.

The brewers sell to the next tier, which comprises distributors. These sales are usually
made at a constant price per unit, i.e., they typically do not set franchise fees or use two-part
tariffs. The distributors warehouse the product, do local advertising and promotion, and also
monitor local beer quality. They sell to the third tier, the retailers from whom consumers
make their purchases of beer. Again, sales to retailers usually employ linear pricing.

All of the major breweries have exclusive dealing contracts with at least some of their
distributors. They also typically assign exclusive territories. The latter means that there is
little _intra_ brand competition among distributors. However, there is a fair bit of _inter_ brand
competition. It is very rare that a single distributor possesses a monopoly in a regional
market.

Sass (2005) first tries to determine what factors lead to the use of exclusive contracts in
the beer market. Data from a _1996/1997 Distributor Brand-Equity Survey_ provides evidence
on 381 distributor contracts, 69 of which include an exclusive dealing clause (most of these
are AB distributors). If foreclosure is a motivation for such contracts, then they should
become less likely as market size grows. This is because foreclosure works by denying the
rival a sufficiently large sales base to permit exploiting scale economies, and this is harder
to do when the market is large. Sass (2005) uses two variables to capture potential market
size. One is the population ( _POP_ ) of the distribution region. The other is the state-level
market share ( _MSD_ ) of the brewery that is the primary supplier of the distributor.

Another factor has to do with the local market information that the distributor has
acquired. A distributor who has a lot of information about local consumer tastes and price
responsiveness will likely be less willing to sign an exclusive dealing contract because
this limits that distributor’s ability to profit from its information. Sass (2005) proxies this
information by the number of years ( _YRS_ ) that the distributor has been owned by the same
family.

Finally, brewers may want to have exclusive dealing when they have large promotional
expenses themselves that raise retail demand for beer in general but which, in the absence
of an exclusive arrangement, the distributor might meet by selling an alternative brand. To
capture the importance of such non-brand specific advertising, Sass (2005) uses the national
advertising of the brewer’s primary supplier ( _ADS_ ) and a 1,0 variable indicating whether or
not there is a state ban on billboard or sign advertising ( _BAN_ ). If protecting its advertising
against free riding is a motivation for the brewer, the first should have a positive effect and
the second should have a negative effect.

Because a contract is either classified as an exclusive deal or not, the independent variable
in the econometric specification is a 1,0 variable and Sass (2005) estimates this regression
using the Probit procedure that we described in the Empirical Application in Chapter 13
regarding the Ellison and Ellison (2006) study of entry into generic drug markets. This
means that the estimated coefficients indicate how much a change in the explanatory


508 Contractual Relations Between Firms


variable would raise or lower the _probability_ of using an exclusive contract. The results are
shown in Table 18.1 below.

Overall, the evidence on the determinants of where exclusive dealing contracts are used
in the US beer market implies that these contracts are not used to harm competition. Instead,
they appear to be used for the beneficial reason of protecting brewers’ investments in their
own product promotion. For example, increases in market size as measured by both _POP_
and _MSD_ raise the likelihood of an excusive dealing clause and the t-statistics indicate that
both of these effects are statistically significant. This suggests that these contracts are not
being used to foreclose markets to rivals. There is some evidence that the real motive is to
protect the brewer’s generalized advertising efforts against free riding. While _ADS_ is not
statistically significant, the presence of a ban against beer advertising on billboards and
signs does have a negative effect on exclusive dealing. When there is less promotion, there
is less need to protect it with an exclusive dealing contract. Finally, there is also evidence
that as distributors gain experience and knowledge of the local market, they are less willing
to sign an exclusive dealing contract that might restrict their ability to profit from that
information. The coefficient on _YRS_ is negative and significant.

Having examined the factors that lead to exclusive dealing, Sass (2005) then turns to
examining the market effects that such contracts have. He considers four possible variables
that might be affected. These are: 1) the average price paid by the distributor to brewers,
_PB_ ; 2) the price the distributor charges retailers for its primary brand, _PD_ ; 3) the quantity
of the primary brand sold, _QPRIMARY_ ; and 4) the quantity of all brands sold, _QTOTAL_,
each measured in logarithms.

Prices of course, should reflect both supply (i.e. cost) and demand pressures. Assuming
that production costs are roughly the same for the brewers, the cost differences in supplying
a distributor will reflect shipping costs or the distance from the nearest plant _DIST_ ; the level
of excise taxes _TAX_ ; and possibly, the presence of a ban on outside advertising _BAN_, which
could raise promotional costs. If these variables affect the price paid by the distributor then
they should also affect the price paid by the retailer. That price in turn should affect both sales
of the primary brand and of all brands. Thus, these three variables belong in all four equations.

To capture demand effects, Sass (2005) uses three variables. These are: 1) per capita
income in the distribution territory, _INC_ ; 2) population in the distribution territory, _POP;_
and the percent of the population that is of prime drinking age, _AGESHARE_ . Of course, the
primary variable of interest is whether or not the distributor in question operated under an
exclusive dealing contract, _EXDEAL_ . This is a binary variable equal to 1 if there was an
exclusive dealing contract and 0 if there was not.

Basically, these are the regressions that Sass (2005) estimates. However, in both the first
and the fourth equations, he also includes market share data for three of the major brands
to see how the extent of their presence affects the brewer’s price to the dealer and final
total sales. Sass (2005) also recognizes that the distributor’s costs, and therefore price to
retailers, may reflect both the distributor’s business savvy as captured by the number of
years the same family has owned the distributorship, and an additional cost factor based on
the average number of retailing stops the distributor must stop at per week. Hence, Sass’s
final set of regressions are as follows:



_PB_ _CONSTANT_ _a_ 1 _EXDEAL_ _a_ 2 _DIST_ _a_ 3 _TAX_ _a_ 4 _BAN_ _a_ 5 _INC_

We are mainly interested in the impact of exclusive dealing. Before discussing that effect,
however, it is worth noting two features of this system. These are reduced form equations.
That is, they are not equations that describe the full supply and demand structure. Instead,
they describe the outcome for the dependent variable in terms of the basic factors that
underlie supply and demand. In each case, the final term represents the influence of random
factors that may affect the brewer’s price, the distributor’s price, primary brand sales, or
total brand sales.

In principle, each of these regressions could be run alone using ordinary least squares
(OLS). However, it seems likely that the random factors that, say, raise total demand may
also affect primary brand demand and, in turn, feed into prices. In other words, while the
regressions may seem independent of each other, there is a correlation between the random
forces affecting each one, i.e., _εPB, εPD, εQPRIMARY_ _,_ and _εTOTAL_ may all be correlated. If


510 Contractual Relations Between Firms


they are, then information about the nature of this correlation can be used to estimate
the regression coefficients more precisely. To do this, Sass (2005) employs a regression
technique known as Seemingly Unrelated Regression. This approach estimates the four
regressions simultaneously by applying an estimate of the correlation across the error terms
to construct generalized least squares (GLS) coefficient estimates. The implied effect of
exclusive dealing in each of the four regressions is shown Table 18.2 below:

In every case, the effect of an exclusive dealing clause is positive and highly significant.
It raises the unit price set by brewers by about 6 percent and the price set by distributors by
about 5 percent. Despite these increases, final sales of both the primary producer’s brand
and of all brands also rise under exclusive dealing. These effects are particularly large.
Demand for the brewer’s product rises by 32 percent as the result of exclusive dealing. Yet
this does not come at the expense of other brands. Instead, their sales rise as well by over
28 percent. In further regressions, Sass (2005) finds that exclusive dealing by one brewer
(AB, in particular) does not significantly decrease rival brewers’ prices.

The implications of these findings are relatively straightforward. The fact that exclusive
dealing rises with the size of the market seems inconsistent with the idea that it is used
as an anticompetitive foreclosure device. This inference is strengthened by the finding that
such restrictions also do not tend to force rivals to lower their prices. Instead, the fact
that exclusive dealing restraints rise with both market size and the presence of restrictions
on outdoor advertising is more consistent with the notion that such contracts are used to
mitigate conflicts between the brewery and its distributors.

Because the price to the distributor and the distributor’s price to the retailer rise while
sales volume also rises, there is no doubt that the surplus of brewers and distributors is
enhanced by exclusive dealing. What happens to retailers and consumers is less clear.
However, the rise in sales volume is sufficiently large that there is a strong supposition
that their surplus also goes up. In short, the results of Sass (2005) strongly indicate that
exclusive dealing in the US beer industry is welfare enhancing.

Sass’s (2005) results are not unusual. For example, Zanarone (2009) examines the
impact of 2002 European regulations that made exclusive territories and minimum quantity
purchases unlawful. Analysis of thirty-eight contracts—half written before 2002 and half
after—shows a systematic shift in decision rights. After the regulations are imposed, auto
manufacturers are much more likely to write contracts that allow the manufacturer to: 1)
impose a maximum resale price; 2) require minimum contributions to the manufacturer’s
national advertising budget; and 3) require that dealers implement a customer satisfaction
survey and achieve minimum standards in those surveys. Thus, like Sass (2005), the
evidence in Zanarone (2009) is again consistent with the idea that the exclusive territories
and minimum quantities of the earlier contracts were meant to prevent too high a retail
markup and too low a provision of retail services.

**Summary**


Contracts between manufacturers and the various retailers that sell the manufactured products
directly to consumers include a variety of nonprice restrictions. These may include an exclusive
dealing restriction that prevents the retailer from
selling the products of any other manufacturer, or
exclusive selling and territorial arrangements that
restrain the manufacturer from allowing any other
retailer to sell its product. They can also include
slotting fees that producers must pay for access to
retail distribution. Because these restrictions so
clearly have the appearance of a restraint on trade,
they fall under suspicion as anticompetitive.

In reality, however, there may be many efficiency gains that lie behind such restrictions.
Often they may serve to ensure adequate promotional activities and other consumer services.
They may also be useful in creating an environment in which retailers can better handle demand
shocks. Yet the fear that these restrictions can be
used either to soften competition or to eliminate
competitors altogether via restrictions that lead
to foreclosure are also justified. In this respect,
there seems little alternative to evaluating each
case on its own merits.

For the most part, public policy towards vertical restraints has increasingly recognized their
potential benefits. This largely reflects the accumulating empirical evidence that these restrictions generally help producers and may help,
or at least not hurt consumers. However, the


**Problems**


1. Most beer companies impose an exclusive
dealing clause on the supermarkets that sell
their products. Discuss whether you think
this practice will yield efficient market outcomes.


2. General Motors, Ford, and Daimler-Chrysler
all operate many divisions of automobile
lines, e.g., _Chevrolet_, _Cadillac_, and _Buick_ .
Discuss the motivation for this practice. Who
do you think this practice benefits the most,
automakers or consumers?


3. In Europe, automobile dealers have traditionally been granted exclusive territories.
Do you think that this practice should be
legal?



Non-Price Vertical Restraints 511


potential for the abuse of market power seems
clear, especially when the restrictions apply to
a large fraction of the existing market. For
this reason, authorities have continued to take
a rule-of-reason approach to non-price vertical
restraints rather than a _per se_ legal one.

Before concluding we note that, in many
respects, the retailer acts as an agent on behalf of
the manufacturer. It learns about consumer tastes,
makes promotional and other service decisions,
and, of course, sets the final consumer price. Consequently, the vertical relationship between the
producer and the retailer is a principal-agent relationship akin to the relationship between a client
and lawyer, or between shareholders and management. The contractual issues that arise between
manufacturer and retailer are therefore part of
a broader set of questions that arise in connection with contracts that govern all principal-agent
relationships. These are important issues in the
theory of the firm. For example, what is the difference between a producer connected to its retailer
by means of a formal contract and a producer that
simply is fully integrated into the retail market;
or, for that matter, a producer that operates a
retail division? Why do firms choose one form
of organization over another? We do not answer
these questions here. However, we do want to
acknowledge that the issue of vertical relationships is really part of a larger question regarding
the boundaries of the firm.


4. Review the model of Rasmussen, Ramseyer,
and Wiley (1991) from Chapter 13. Why are
scale economies important for this argument
that exclusive dealing can deter entry?


5. Who would be willing to pay more for the
right to use the McDonald’s name—an outlet located in the center of Centerville, or one
that would do the same amount of business
at the interstate turnpike?


6. What are the incentives for McDonald’s to
require franchisees to buy hamburger buns,
meat, napkins, and other supplies from it
rather than from other, possibly lower-cost
local suppliers, other than the incentive of
removing double-marginalization?
