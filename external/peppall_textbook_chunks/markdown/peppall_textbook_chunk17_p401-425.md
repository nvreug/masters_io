where _Q_ is aggregate output produced by the _N_ firms and _Q_ _i_ is the aggregate output of

                      all firms except firm _i_ ; that is,


_Q_ - _i_ = _Q_ - _qi_

The profit function for firm _i_ can then be written as

_πi(qi, Q_  - _i)_ = _qi_ [ _A_  - _B(qi_ + _Q_  - _i)_  - _c_ ] _._ (15.3)

In a Cournot game, firms choose their output levels simultaneously to maximize profit.
The resulting profit to each firm in a Cournot equilibrium is



_(A_ _c)_ [2]
_i_ _[C]_ [=] _B(N_ - 1



_π_ _[C]_



(15.4)
_B(N_ + 1 _)_ [2]



Suppose now that _M_ ≥ 2 of these firms decide to merge. To exclude the case of merger
to monopoly, we assume that _M < N_ . Such a merger leads to an industry that contains
_N_ - _M_ + 1 firms. Because all firms are the same, we can think of the merged firm as
comprised of firms 1 through _M._

The new merged firm picks its output _qm_ to maximize profit, which is given by

_πm(qm, Q_  - _m)_ = _qm_ [ _A_  - _B(qm_ + _Q_  - _m)_  - _c_ ] (15.5)

where _Q_ _m_ _qm_ 1 _qm_ 2 _. . ._ _qN_ denotes the aggregate output of the _N_ _M_ firms
that have not merged. Each of the nonmerged firms chooses its output to maximize profit− = + + + + + given, as before, by

_πi(qi, Q_  - _i)_ = _qi_ [ _A_  - _B(qi_ + _Q_  - _i)_  - _c_ ] _._ (15.6)

In this case, the term _Q_ _i_ now denotes the sum of the outputs _qj_ of each of the _N_ _M_

         -         nonmerging firms excluding firm _i,_ plus the output of the merged firm _qm._

The only difference between equations (15.5) and (15.6) is that in the former we have a
subscript _m_ while in the latter we have a subscript _i_ . In other words, a crucial implication
of equations (15.5) and (15.6) is that, after the merger, _the merged firm acts just like any_
_one of the other firms in the industry_ . This means that all of these _N_ - _M_ + 1 firms, each
having identical costs and producing the same product, must in equilibrium produce the
same amount of output and therefore earn the same profit. In other words, in the post-merger
Cournot equilibrium, it must be the case that the output and profit of the merged firm, _qm_ _[C]_

and _π_ _[C][,]_ [ are the same as the output and profit of each nonmerged firm. Using the Cournot]



and _πm_ _[C][,]_ [ are the same as the output and profit of each nonmerged firm. Using the Cournot]

output and profit equations for a market with _N_ - _M_ + 1 firms, these are, respectively:

(15.7)
_B(N_ - _M_ + 2 _)_ [2]



where the subscript _m_ denotes the merged firm and _nm_ a nonmerged firm.

Equations (15.4) and (15.7) allow us to compare the profit of the nonmerging firms
before and after the merger. The first point to note is the free-riding opportunity afforded to
the nonmerging firms when other firms merge. We know that in the Cournot model as the
number of firms decreases industry output falls and price rises. Of course, a merger does
just that. It reduces the number of firms. So the price rises for all firms, including those


390 Contractual Relations Between Firms


that did not merge. Moreover the merger allows those firms to gain market share while also
benefiting from the increase in the market price.

What about the merging firms? There are _M_ of these and, prior to the merger, each one
earned the profit shown in equation (15.4). Hence, the aggregate profit of these firms taken
together is _M_ times that amount. After the merger, the profit of the merged firm is the profit
shown in equation (15.7). Is the profit of the merged firm greater than the aggregate profit
earned by the _M_ firms before the merger? For the answer to be yes, it must be the case that



_(A_ _c)_ [2]

(15.8)
_B(N_ + 1 _)_ [2]



This requires



_(N_ + 1 _)_ [2] ≥ _M(N_  - _M_ + 2 _)_ [2] (15.9)

Note that equation (15.9) does not include any of the demand parameters or the firms’
marginal costs. In other words, equation (15.9) tells us about the profitability of _any M_ firm
merger. All that is required is that demand is linear and that the firms each have the same,
constant marginal costs.

In our example in which the number of firms is _N_ = 3 and the number of firms merging
is _M_ = 2 _,_ it’s easy to see then that the inequality in (15.9) is not satisfied. In other words,
in a three-firm market satisfying our demand and cost assumptions _no two-firm merger is_
_profitable_ .

Condition (15.9) is much more general than this and turns out to be very difficult to satisfy
even when more than two firms merge, as long as the merger does not result in a monopoly.
To see this, suppose that we substitute _M_ = _aN_ in equation (15.9), with 0 _< a <_ 1. That
is, _a_ is the fraction of firms in the industry that merge. We can then work out how large _a_
has to be for the merger to be profitable. A little manipulation of condition (15.9) shows
that for a merger to be profitable, we must have _a > a(N)_ where: [5]



_a(N)_ [3][ +][ 2] _[N]_ [ −]
= 2

Table 15.1 gives _a(N)_ and the associated minimum number of firms _M_ that have to
merge for the merger to be profitable for a range of values of _N,_ the number of firms in the
industry.

Equation (15.10) and Table 15.1 illustrate what has come to be termed the 80 percent
rule. For a merger to be profitable in our simple Cournot world of linear demand and
identical constant costs, it is necessary that at least 80 percent of the firms in the market
merge. The problem is that a merger of this magnitude would almost never be allowed by
the antitrust authorities.

There are currently twenty identical firms that clean carpets in the area. The unit cost
of cleaning a carpet is constant and equal to $30. Firms in this industry compete in
quantities.


a. Show that in a Cournot–Nash equilibrium the profit of each firm is _π_ = 22 _._ 67 _._
b. Now suppose that six firms in the industry merge. Show that the profit of each firm
in the post-merger Cournot game is _π_ = 39 _._ 06. Show that the profit earned by the
merged firm is insufficient to compensate all the shareholders/owners who owned the
six original firms and earned profit from them in the pre-merger market game.
c. Show that if fewer than seventeen firms merge, the profit of the merged firm is not
great enough to buy out the shareholders/owners of the firms who merge.


The merger paradox is that many, if not most, horizontal mergers are unprofitable when
viewed through the lens of our standard Cournot model. Yet, as the events of the 1990s and
even of more recent years tell us, horizontal mergers appear to happen all the time. What
aspect of real-world mergers has the simple Cournot model failed to capture? Alternatively,
what aspect of the Cournot model is responsible for this prediction that seems at odds with
reality?

The critical aspect of the Cournot model that gives rise to the merger paradox is not
difficult to find. When firms merge in the Cournot model, the new combined firm behaves
after the merger just like any of the remaining firms that did not merge. Thus, if two firms
in a three-firm industry merge, the new firm competes as a duopolist. The nonmerging firm
in this case has, after the merger, equal status to the merged firm even though it now faces
the combined strength of both of its previous rivals.

One cannot help but suspect that, for a merger of any substantial size, either the newly
merged firm is different in some material sense from its unmerged rivals, or the overall
market has changed in a way that alters rivals’ behavior. In the next three sections, we
explore such possible modifications while staying within the basic homogeneous good
Cournot framework. In the subsequent section, we consider mergers in a market with
differentiated products.


15.2 MERGERS AND COST SYNERGIES


In presenting the merger paradox, we assumed that all firms in the market have identical
costs and that there are no fixed costs. What happens if we relax these assumptions? It
seems reasonable to suppose that if a merger creates sufficiently large cost savings it should
be profitable. In this section, we develop an example to show that this can indeed be the
case. [6]


6 This is a special case of a much more sophisticated analysis by Farrell and Shapiro (1990) who show in
a general setting that for consumers to benefit from a profitable horizontal merger of Cournot firms the
merger has to create substantial cost synergies.


392 Contractual Relations Between Firms


Suppose that the market contains three Cournot firms. Consumer demand is given by


_P_ = 150 − _Q_ (15.11)

where _Q_ is aggregate output, which pre-merger is _q_ 1 _q_ 2 _q_ 3. Two of these firms are
low-cost firms with a marginal cost of 30, so that total costs at each are given by + +


_C_ 1 _(q_ 1 _)_ _f_ 30 _q_ 1 _C_ 2 _(q_ 2 _)_ _f_ 30 _q_ 2 (15.12)
= + ; = +


The third firm is potentially high-cost with total costs given by


_C_ 3 _(q_ 3 _)_ _f_ 30 _bq_ 3 (15.13)
= +

where _b_ ≥ 1 is a measure of the cost disadvantage from which firm 3 suffers. In these
cost functions _f_ represents fixed costs associated with overhead expenses such as those
for marketing or for maintaining corporate headquarters. We now consider the effect of a
merger of firms 2 and 3.


15.2.1 The Merger Reduces Fixed Costs

Consider first the case in which _b_ = 1 so that all firms have the same marginal cost of
30. Suppose, however, that after the merger, the merged firm has fixed costs _af_ with
1 ≤ _a_ ≤ 2. What this means is that the merger allows the merged firms to economize on
overhead costs, for example by combining the headquarters of the two firms, eliminating
unnecessary overlap, combining R&D functions, and economizing on duplicated marketing
efforts. These are, in fact, typical cost savings that most firms expect, or at least state they
expect, to result from a merger.

Because the merger leaves marginal costs unaffected, this is similar to our first example,
only now firms also have fixed costs. Accordingly, we know that in the pre-merger market
each firm earns a profit of $900 − _f_ . In the post-merger market with just two firms, the
nonmerged firm earns a profit of $1,600 − _f_ while the merged firm earns $1,600 − _af_ .
Hence, for this merger to be profitable, it must be the case that $1,600 − _af >_ $1,800 − 2 _f_
which requires that _a <_ 2 − 200 _/f_ . What this says is that a merger is more likely to be
profitable when fixed costs are relatively high and the merger gives the merged firm the
ability to make “substantial” savings in these costs. Note, however, that even if the merger
is profitable for the merging firms, consumers are actually worse off as a result of the higher
equilibrium price. That same higher price also raises the profit of the nonmerged firm.
Moreover, it is still the case that the merged firm loses market share after the merger.


15.2.2 The Merger Reduces Variable Costs


Now consider the case in which the source of the cost savings is not a reduction in fixed
costs but instead a reduction in variable costs which we capture by assuming that _b >_ 1.
In other words, firm 3 is a high variable cost firm. It follows that after a merger of firms 2
and 3, production will be rationalized and the high-cost operations will be shut down (or
redesigned to operate the low cost technology). To make matters as simple as possible, we
assume that there are no fixed costs _(f_ = 0 _)._

Once again, we assume a Cournot framework. The outputs and profits of the three firms
prior to the merger are:

4 4

with each of the low cost firms, 1 and 2, producing a greater amount than their high cost
rival, firm 3.

Now, as before, suppose that firms 2 and 3 merge. Because for any _b >_ 1 _,_ it is always
more expensive to produce a unit of output at firm 3 than it is at firm 2, all production
will be transferred to firm 2’s technology. The result is that the market now contains two
identical firms, 1 and 2, each with marginal costs of $30. Accordingly, in the post-merger
industry, each firm produces 40 units, the product price is $70 and each firm earns $1,600 _._

Is this a profitable merger? For the merger to increase aggregate profit of the merged
firms it must be the case that

You can check that this simplifies to


25

2 _[(]_ [7][ −] [3] _[b)(]_ [15] _[b]_ [ −] [19] _[) >]_ [ 0] (15.16)


The first bracketed term in equation (15.16) has to be positive for firm 3 to have been in
the market in the first place. (See footnote 7.) So the merger is profitable provided that the
second bracket is also positive, which requires that _b >_ 19 _/_ 15. In other words, _a merger_
_between a high-cost and a low-cost firm is profitable provided that the cost disadvantage of_
_the high-cost firm prior to the merger is “large enough.”_ In the case at hand, large enough
means that firm 3’s unit cost is at least 25 percent greater than firm 2’s unit cost. However,
as we have already demonstrated, whether the merger is profitable or not, price rises and
consumers are made worse off.

Together, our analysis of a merger that generates fixed cost savings and one that generates
variable cost savings makes clear that mergers can be profitable when the cost savings are
great enough. However, there is no guarantee that consumers gain from such a merger.
Admittedly, the merger removes a relatively inefficient technology but it also reduces
competitive pressures between the remaining firms. Farrell and Shapiro (1990) demonstrate
that in the Cournot setting used here, the cost savings necessary to generate a gain for
consumers are much larger than those needed simply to make the merger profitable. In turn,
this suggests that we should be skeptical of cost savings as a justification of the benefits to
consumers of horizontal mergers.


7 Note that this equilibrium exists only if there is a limit on the disadvantage _b_ for firm 3. Specifically, firm
3’s pre-merger output in equation (15.14) will be positive only if _b <_ 210 _/_ 90 = 7 _/_ 3 _,_ otherwise it will not
operate in this market in the first place.


394 Contractual Relations Between Firms


Research by both Lichtenberg and Siegel (1992) and Maksimovic and Phillips (2001)
finds that merger related productivity gains and therefore marginal cost savings, while real,
are typically no more than 1 to 2 percent. Salinger (2005) expresses even more doubt that
fixed cost savings are substantial. Beyond all this, it is also worth noting that even with
cost savings, part of our initial paradox still remains because large profit gains continue to
accrue to the firms that do not merge. Why should a firm incur the headaches of merging if
it can enjoy many of the same benefits by free-riding on other mergers? [8]


function _P_ = 180 − _Q_ . Suppose that there are currently three firms that clean carpets in
the area. The unit cost of cleaning a carpet is constant and equal to $30 for two firms and
is $30 _b_ for the third firm, where _b_ ≥ 1. In addition, all firms have fixed overhead costs of
$900. Firms in this industry compete in quantities.


a. What is the Cournot–Nash equilibrium price and what are the outputs and profits of
each firm? What is the upper limit on _b_ for the third firm to be able to survive?
b. Now suppose that a low-cost firm merges with the high-cost firm. In doing so, the
fixed costs of the merged firm become $900 _a_ with 1 ≤ _a_ ≤ 2. What is the post-merger
equilibrium price? What are the outputs of the nonmerged and the merged firms?
c. Derive a relationship between _a_ and _b_ that is necessary to guarantee that the profit
earned by the merged firm is sufficient to compensate all the shareholders/owners who
owned the two original firms and earned profit from them in the pre-merger market
game. Comment on this relationship.


15.3 THE MERGED FIRM AS A STACKELBERG LEADER


If cost efficiencies are not a promising way to resolve the merger paradox, then perhaps a
resolution can be found in some other change that gives the merged firm an advantage. One
possibility is that merged firms become Stackelberg leaders in the post-merger market. [9]

Recall from our discussion in Section 11.1 that the source of a Stackelberg leader firm’s
advantage is its ability to commit to an output before output decisions are taken by the
follower firms. This permits a leader to choose an output that takes into account the reactions
of the followers.

Let us assume that a merged firm acquires a leadership role and see whether the
commitment power associated with market leadership can resolve the merger paradox.
Certainly, such a role seems plausible. After all, the new firm has a combined capacity
twice that of any of its nonmerged rivals, and so might well be able to act as a Stackelberg
leader. Will this be enough to make a merger profitable? If so, what will be the response of
other firms? Will they also have an incentive to merge? If they do, will their merging undo
the profitability of the first merger and thereby, if firms are foresighted, discourage them
from merging in the first place?


8 Perry and Porter (1985) assume that each firm’s cost schedule declines with the total amount of capital it
owns. Hence, by merging and gaining more capital, a firm lowers its costs. The scarcity of capital makes it
difficult for other firms to do this and, because of rising costs, to free-ride as much on the merger of rivals.
9 This analysis draws on the model of A.F. Daughety (1990), who suggested this role for the merged firms.


Horizontal Mergers 395


Suppose that demand is of the usual linear form: _P_ = _A_  - _BQ_ . There are _N_ + 1 firms in
the industry and each of the _N_ + 1 firms has a constant marginal cost of _c_ . We know from
the standard Cournot model that the equilibrium is described by the following equations:



_A_ _c_
_qi_ = _(N_ - 2 _)B_ _[(N]_ [ +] _(N_ [ 1] _[)(A]_ 2 _)B_ [ −] _[c)]_
+ [⇒] _[Q]_ [ =] +




[ +][ 1] _[)(A]_ [ −] _[c)]_

_(N_ 2 _)B_ = _N_ 2
+ +



(15.17)
_N_ + 2



The profit of each firm, _(P_ - _c)qi_ is therefore:

_(A_ _c)_ [2]
_πi_ = _B(N_  - 2 _)_ [2] (15.18)

+

Suppose now that two of these firms merge and, as a result, become a Stackelberg leader.
The market now contains _F_ = _N_ - 1 follower firms and one leader firm so that we now
have _N_ firms in total. Of course, the Stackelberg leader is able to choose its output first in
a two-stage game. In stage one, the leader chooses its output _Q_ _[L]_ . In the second stage, the
follower firms independently choose their outputs in response to that chosen by the leader.

To find the equilibrium, we work through the game backwards. Consider the second stage
of the game in which the follower nonmerged firms make their output decisions in response
to the output choice _Q_ _[L]_ of the leader or merged firm. We use the notation _QF_ _f_ to denote

                            the aggregate output of the follower firms _other than f,_ and denote the output of follower
firm _f_ by _qf_ . Then aggregate output of _all_ firms is _Q_ _Q_ _[L]_ _QF_ _f_ _qf_ . Moreover, the
residual demand for firm _f,_ which is the demand left after taking into account the outputs = + - +
of the leader and the followers other than firm _f_ is:


_P_ [ _A_ _B(Q_ _[L]_ _QF_ _f )_ ] _Bqf_ (15.19)
=  - +  -  

Marginal revenue for firm _f_ is, therefore,


_MRf_ [ _A_ _B(Q_ _[L]_ _QF_ _f )_ ] 2 _Bqf ._ (15.20)
=   - +   -   
Equating this with marginal cost gives the best response function for firm _f_ :



_f_ [∗] [=] _[A]_ 2 [ −] _B_ _[c]_

Equation (15.21) is the best response of a follower firm to both the output of the leader
and the output of all the other follower firms. Because all follower firms are identical,
symmetry demands that in equilibrium the output of each of the follower firms must be
identical. The group of followers excluding firm _f_ has _F_ - 1 = _N_ - 2 firms. Therefore,
_Q_ [∗] _[ (N]_ [2] _[)q]_ [∗] [. Substituting this into equation (15.21) and simplifying gives the]

We can use the same basic technique to determine the output for the leader firm in stage
one of the game. The residual inverse demand function for the leader firm is dependent
upon the output of all the other firms, which is given by equation (15.23). So, the demand
function facing leader firm _l_ is:

(15.25)

Equating this marginal revenue with marginal cost allows us to solve for the leader firm’s
optimal output:

_MRl_ = _c_ ⇒ _Q_ _[L]_ = _[A]_ 2 [ −] _B_ _[c]_ (15.26)

You should by now recognize that the output level in equation (15.26) is just the output
level chosen by a uniform-pricing monopolist. This is, of course, a standard result for
a single leader model with linear demand and constant costs. In turn, this implies the
following industry equilibrium values:

Comparison of equation (15.28) with (15.18) reveals that for any industry initially
comprising three or more firms and characterized by symmetric Cournot competition, a
two-firm merger that creates a Stackelberg leader is profitable for the merged firms. This
seems to resolve the merger paradox. However, equations (15.28) and (15.18) also show
that the unmerged firms who have become followers are definitely worse off as a result of
the merger. We may therefore expect some response from these firms.

Furthermore, if we compare the market price and output in (15.17) with that in (15.27),
we find that while the merger has raised the profit of the merging parties, it also has lowered


Horizontal Mergers 397


price. Hence, the merger is good for consumers. We seem to have replaced one paradox
with another. We now have a model in which a merger is profitable, but that model also
removes a principal reason why the antitrust authorities should object to such a merger.

However, we need to consider the response of other firms to the merger. Because
leadership confers additional profit, they, too, have an incentive to merge and become
leaders. This raises the question as to what happens if there is more than one two-firm
merger. Daughety’s (1990) model answers this question by assuming that there can be
more than one leader firm and merging is the ticket to entry into the club of such leaders.
That is, imagine a market that may be divided into two groups of firms: followers and
leaders. The first of these groups acts just as the followers did in the preceding analysis.
They compete as Cournot rivals over the demand remaining after the leaders make their
output decisions. The group of leaders understands this reaction. They compete as Cournot
rivals _against each other_ in the knowledge that they act first and the followers take their
production decisions as given.

To analyze this two-stage competition, we can use the model derived above. In particular,
instead of assuming _N_ firms with one leader and _N_ - 1 followers, we can assume that there
are _N_ firms with _L_ leaders and _N_ - _L_ = _F_ followers. The detailed calculations for this
version of the model are presented in the Appendix. Here we concentrate on the resulting
price and profit equations. These imply that in an industry comprised of _N_ firms in total, _L_
of which are leaders, the price-cost margin _(P_ - _c),_ the profits for the typical leader firm
_(P_ - _c) ql_ [∗] _[,]_ [ and typical follower firm] _[ (P]_ [ −] _[c)q]_ _f_ [∗] [are:]

_π_ _[F]_ _(N, L)_  - (15.31)
= _B(L_ 1 _)_ [2] _(N_ _L_ 1 _)_ [2]

+         - +


You can readily confirm that the profit values shown in equations (15.30) and (15.31) for
the general case of _N_ total firms with _L_ leaders yields the same profits as those given in
equation (15.28) for the special case of _N_ total firms and _L_ = 1 leader.

It is clear from these profit equations that the leader firms are individually more profitable
than the nonmerged followers. However, that is not the real issue facing two firms that are
contemplating merger. The question is whether _one more merger_ is profitable, given that
there will then be one more leader, two fewer followers, and one less firm in total. This is
why we have written the profit expressions as functions of _N_ and _L_ . The point is that an
additional merger creates two countervailing forces. On the one hand, there are fewer firms
in total, which ought to increase profits, but there are also more leaders, which ought to
decrease the profits of the leaders. Which force is greater?

Suppose there is an additional merger of two followers, so that the newly merged firm
and all other leaders earn profit given by equation (15.30) with _N_ replaced by _N_ - 1 and
_L_ replaced by _L_ + 1 to give _π_ _[L]_ _(N_ - 1 _, L_ + 1 _)_ . For there to be an incentive to merge,
this profit must exceed the combined profit earned by the two follower firms prior to the

This simplifies to the condition

Note that this condition does not include the demand parameters _A_ and _B_ or the marginal
cost _c_ . In other words, the profitability or otherwise of this type of merger depends only on
the number of leaders and followers, not on the precise demand and cost conditions.

We show in the Appendix that the condition in (15.33) is always met. [10] In other words,
starting from any configuration of leaders and followers, _an additional two follower firms_
_always wish to merge_ .

This result is encouraging. It says that the Daughety model offers one way to resolve the
merger paradox. A merger raises the profit of the two merging firms by allowing them to
take a position as one of, perhaps several, industry leaders. Moreover, the fact that such a
merger is always profitable also helps us to understand better the domino effect so often
observed within an industry. Once one firm merges and becomes a leader, the remaining
firms will wish to do the same rather than watch their output and their profits be squeezed.

While the Daughety model can resolve the merger paradox, it does leave unanswered
the question as to whether such mergers are in the public interest. Is there some point at
which further mergers are harmful to consumers? The answer to this question can be most
easily derived from the price-cost margin _P(N, L)_ - _c_ shown in equation (15.29). Because
marginal cost _c_ is constant, any rise or fall in _P(N, L)_ will be reflected in a rise or fall of
_P(N, L)_ - _c._

With _L_ leader merged firms and _A_ _c_ _N_  - _L_ follower nonmerged firms, the price-cost margin

is _(L_ + 1 _)(N_  - _L_ + 1 _)_ [. An additional two-firm merger increases] _A_ _[ L]_ _c_ [ to] _[ L]_ [ +][ 1 and decreases]

_N_ to _N_ 1 _,_ so that the price-cost margin is now    - _(L_ 2 _)(N_ _L_ 1 _)_ [. Thus for this]

What this tells us is that an additional two-firm merger benefits consumers only if
_N >_ 3 _(L_ + 1 _)_ or, equivalently, _L < N/_ 3 − 1. In other words, _a two-firm merger that_
_increases the number of leaders benefits consumers only if the current group of leaders_
_contains fewer than a third of the total number of firms in the industry_ . We know from
equation (15.33) that a two-firm merger that creates a leader will always be profitable. Yet,
as we have also just shown, such a merger will be harmful to consumers once the leader
group includes one-third or more of the industry’s firms. In other words, some mergers
are bad—at least for consumers. Accordingly, we now have a model that both resolves
the merger paradox and explains why the antitrust authorities are correct to worry about
anticompetitive mergers.

For example, return to Practice Problem 15.3 in which we had five leader firms and ten
follower firms cleaning carpets in Dirtville. In that scenario, we know that the equilibrium
price for cleaning a carpet is $31.55. Now suppose that two additional firms merge to join
the leadership group. We then have a market structure of six leaders and eight followers.
In this case, the equilibrium price for cleaning a carpet is $31.60. This merger harms the
consumers in Dirtville.

Daughety’s model solves the merger paradox and gives rise to a merger wave by
assuming an asymmetry between newly merged firms and their remaining unmerged rivals.
The former gain membership in the club of industry leaders. However, this is a rather strong
assumption. While some mergers may create corporate giants with an ability to commit to
large production levels, it is far from obvious that every two-firm merger should have this
leadership role regardless of which two firms are joined and irrespective of the number of
leaders already present. In principle, Daughety’s model implies that in an industry of ten
firms there could be, say, eight leaders. It seems odd to imagine a configuration with so
many leaders and so few followers. Moreover, it leaves unanswered the question as to what
happens if two leaders merge. Does this merger create a super-leader?

It is also worth noting that while output decisions are sequential in Daughety’s model,
merging is not. While leader firms choose production first, it is not accurate to describe
the decision to merge in a sequential way. The model simply says that for any market
configuration, if a two-firm merger creates an industry leader, all follower firm pairs will

wish to merge as well. One pair does not merge only after it sees another pair merge.
Instead, at any single point in time, merging is a dominant strategy and, absent any
antitrust intervention, all follower firms will pursue it. Again, this is not because of any
new cost savings or product development. It is simply because merging confers leadership
status. Daughety’s model does not give rise to the sporadic merger waves that we often
see as much as it suggests an ever-present tendency for the industry to become more
concentrated.

15.4 SEQUENTIAL MERGERS


To capture the idea that merger decisions may be explicitly sequential, i.e., that the decision
of one firm pair to merge is a catalyst for another pair to do the same, a number of
papers including Nilssen and Sørgaard (1998), Fauli-Oller (2000) and Salvo (2010) have
presented models in which a sudden change in cost or product qualities gives rise to merger
opportunities that are only profitable if other mergers also occur. It is difficult for this to
happen in a simultaneous game because each potential merger pair cannot be sure if others
will also merge. However, in a sequential game, some firms get to make their merger
decision knowing for certain that others have already merged. This greatly enhances the
likelihood of a successful merger.

We illustrate the sequential merger model with a simplification of the Fauli-Oller (2000)
model. Consider a four-firm industry characterized by Cournot competition. Initially, all of
these firms are high-cost firms with constant unit cost _c_ _[h]_ = _c_ . Suppose that two firms have
had a technical breakthrough that allows them to become low-cost firms with low constant
unit cost _c_ _[l]_ = 0. Industry demand is described by: _P_ = _A_ - _Q_ .

Now consider the following sequential scenario. In period 1, low-cost firm 1 decides
whether to merge with one of the high-cost firms 3 and 4. Without loss of generality, suppose
that firm 1 chooses whether or not to merge with firm 3. In period 2 low-cost firm 2, having
observed firm 1’s decision, decides whether or not to merge with the remaining high-cost
firm 4. The game ends after period 2. To determine the subgame perfect equilibrium we
need the pay-offs detailed in Table 15.2. Clearly, for these to make sense we must have
_A >_ 3 _c_ otherwise a high-cost firm cannot be active in the no-merger case.

Rather than work with this general case, we consider a specific example in which _A_ = 100
and _c_ = 10. This gives the profits reported in Table 15.3.

First note that a merger in period 1 by firms 1 and 3 _not_ followed by a merger of firms 2
and 4 is unprofitable for the merged firms. Merger gives them a combined profit of $756.25
whereas not merging gives aggregate profit to these two firms of $ _(_ 576 + 196 _)_ = $772.

**Figure 15.1** Sequential mergers









What we now show is that assuming mergers to be sequential actually leads to merger being
profitable in our example.

The extensive form of the game is illustrated in Figure 15.1. In formulating the game,
we assume that a merger offer will not be made unless the post-merger profit of the merged
entity is greater than the aggregate profit of the two firms pre-merger. If this were not the
case, no merger offer could be made that is satisfactory to both firms. Thus the pay-offs in
Figure 15.1 for a pair of unmerged firms are aggregate profits As usual we solve this game
backwards.

Suppose first that firms 1 and 3 choose to merge. If firms 2 and 4 choose not to merge
they earn aggregate profit $ _(_ 756.25 + 306.25 _)_ = $1062.50 whereas if they merge they earn
profit $1,111.11. They will choose to merge. Suppose instead that firms 1 and 3 choose not to
merge. If firms 2 and 4 also choose not to merge they earn aggregate profit $ _(_ 576 + 196 _)_ =
$772 whereas if they merge they earn profit $756.25. They will choose not to merge.

Firms 1 and 3 can now see that if they merge this will be followed by a merger of firms
2 and 4, with the result that firms 1 and 3 as a merged entity earns profit $1,111.11. By
contrast, if firms 1 and 3 do not merge, firms 2 and 4 will also choose not to merge, with the
result that firms 1 and 3 earn aggregate profit of $772. Firms 1 and 3 will therefore choose
to merge, in the knowledge that their merger will be followed in the next period by a merger
of firms 2 and 4. As a result, we can expect a merger wave in which first one pair merges
and then the second pair merges. In other words, conditional on the first merger taking
place, the second merger is profitable. In effect, the sequential nature of the game allows
the first pair to commit credibly to merging. In turn, this means that the second merger pair
does not have to worry that in merging they may be acting alone.

Such a merger wave is, however, not good for consumers. Prior to either merger talking
place price is _(A_ + 2 _c)/_ 5 = $24 whereas after the merger wave it is _A/_ 3 = $33.33 _._

The foregoing story is not limited to just two mergers or to models of Cournot
competition. Once cost asymmetries or product quality differences are introduced, we can
construct sequential merger models that lead to merger waves for a large number of firms in
a variety of settings, e.g., Nilssen and Sørgaard (1998) and Salvo (2006), and these mergers
are also anticompetitive. This approach offers another resolution to the merger paradox not
simply because it demonstrates why mergers may happen but, in addition, why they often
happen in sequential waves. As with Daughety’s (1990) model, these models also justify
concern over the impact that mergers may have on consumer prices.

15.5 HORIZONTAL MERGERS AND PRODUCT
DIFFERENTIATION


Our analysis of mergers has so far been set in the Cournot framework of identical products
and quantity competition. However, many firms expend considerable effort differentiating
their products and this differentiation gives them some latitude in setting their price.
Accordingly, we also need to consider the incentives for and the impact of mergers in
industries in which firms produce and market differentiated products.

It is particularly important to explore the merger phenomenon in differentiated product
markets for at least two reasons. First, firms are often price setters in such markets and the
nature of competition is different with price competition than with quantity competition. In
quantity competition, firms’ best response functions are downward sloping, i.e., quantities
are strategic substitutes. Thus, when merging occurs, the nonmerged firms want to _increase_
their outputs in response to the lower output produced by the merger. This response
undermines the effectiveness of the merger. By contrast, with price competition, best
response functions are upward sloping: prices are strategic complements. A merger leading
to an increase in the merged firms’ price(s) will encourage the nonmerged firms also to
increase their prices, potentially strengthening the effectiveness of the merger.

Second, we saw that one reason for the merger paradox under Cournot competition is that
the merged firm looks no different from a nonmerged firm. If _m_ firms merge, effectively
_m_ - 1 of them disappear. This is not the case with differentiated products. Merger allows
coordination of the prices of the products offered by the merged firm _and also_ allows the
merged firm to keep all _m_ products on the market.

We develop this intuition more explicitly using two different approaches to product
differentiation. The first approach is to extend our standard linear demand representation
of consumer preferences to incorporate product differentiation. The second is to adopt the
spatial model of horizontal differentiation, which we first introduced in Chapter 4 and then
revisited in Chapter 10. [11]


15.5.1 Bertrand Competition and Merger with Linear Demand Systems


Suppose that there are three firms in the market, each producing a single differentiated
product. [12] Inverse demand for each of the three products is assumed to be given by:



_p_ 1 _A_ _Bq_ 1 _s(q_ 2 _q_ 3 _)_
=  -  - +



_p_ 2 _A_ _Bq_ 2 _s(q_ 1 _q_ 3 _)_ _(_ 0 _s < B)_
=  -  - + ≤



_p_ 3 _A_ _Bq_ 3 _s(q_ 1 _q_ 2 _)_ (15.35)
=  -  - +



In these inverse demand functions, the parameter _s_ measures how similar the three products
are to each other. If _s_ = 0 the products are totally differentiated. In this case, each firm

11 The spatial model was first formulated in Hotelling (1929), and subsequently extended in Schmalensee
(1978) and Salop (1979). We saw in Chapters 4, 7, and 10 that this sort of spatial model has proven
insightful in analyzing a variety of topics in industrial organization, including brand proliferation in the
ready-to-eat breakfast cereal industry, Schmalensee (1978), and the effects of deregulation of transport
services such as airlines or passenger buses, Greenhut, Norman, and Greenhut (1991). It is not surprising
that the spatial model is also useful in analyzing mergers of firms selling differentiated products.
12 An excellent development of the full analysis can be found in Deneckere and Davidson (1985).


404 Contractual Relations Between Firms


is effectively a monopolist. By contrast, as _s_ approaches _B_ the three products become
increasingly identical, moving us closer to the homogeneous product case. We also assume
that the three firms have identical marginal costs of _c_ per unit. Finally, assume that the
three firms are Bertrand competitors, i.e., they compete in prices and set their prices
simultaneously.

We show in the Appendix to this chapter that when these firms compete they each set a

Now suppose that firms 1 and 2 merge but that the merged and nonmerged firms continue
to set their prices simultaneously. The two previously independent, single-product firms are
now product divisions of a two-product merged firm, coordinating their prices to maximize
the joint profit of the two divisions. The result is that the merged firm sets its product prices

It is straightforward to confirm that the merger increased the prices of all three products,
as we might have expected because the merger reduces competitive pressures in the market.
However, there remains the question of the merger’s profitability. The profits of each
product division (1 and 2) of the merged firm, and the profit of the independent nonmerged
firm 3 are, respectively:



_(A_ _c)_ [2] _(B_ _s)(B_ _s)_ [3]

(15.37)



In comparing equations (15.37) and (15.36), we can simplify matters by normalizing
_A_ - _c_ = 1 and _B_ = 1 _,_ so that profits are functions solely of the degree of product differentiation _s_ . It is then easy to confirm that this two-firm merger is profitable for the merged
firm _and_ for the nonmerged firm. More generally, Deneckere and Davidson (1985) show
that in a market containing _N_ firms, any merger of _M_ ≥ 2 firms is profitable for the merged
firms and for the nonmerged firms. This simple framework of price setting in a product
differentiated market avoids the merger paradox, suggesting that mergers are both profitable
and of potential concern to antitrust authorities unless accompanied by cost efficiencies.


15.5.2 Mergers in a Spatial Market


In the spatial model, a merger between two firms may well bring increased profit for reasons
similar to those in the previous section. Although merging means that the firms lose their
separate identity, they do not lose the ownership or control of the product varieties they
offer. For example, the merger of two major banks, Bank of America and Fleet Bank, results
in a single new corporate entity. Yet it does not require that the new firm give up any of the
locations at which either Bank of America or Fleet currently operate—or that it lose control


Horizontal Mergers 405


over the choice of moving some of those locations. Similarly, the acquisition many years
ago of American Motors by Chrysler did not mean that the Jeep product line disappeared.

When we consider a firm’s product lines, there is a second source of potential profit
increase. The merged firms can now coordinate not just the prices but also the design of
their product line, or in the context of the spatial model, their location choices. Chrysler can
redesign the Jeep line to fit better in its overall range of models. Similarly, Bank of America
and Fleet can change the locations of their branches in those areas where each formerly
operated an outlet quite close to the other.

To investigate the impact of a merger in the spatial model, we begin by recalling the basic
setup of the model. [13] There is a group of consumers who are uniformly distributed over a
linear market of length _L_ . Again, we can think of this as Main Street in Littlesville. However,
one small problem with the Main Street analogy is that outlets at either end of the market can
only reach consumers on one side. This restriction introduces an asymmetry in the model,
which we would like to avoid. To make the product differentiated market symmetric, we
can bend the ends of the line around until they touch each other, and replace our straight
line of length _L_ with a circle of circumference _L_ . For example, if we use the spatial
model to represent departure times in the differentiated passenger airline market, the circle
represents the twenty-four hours of the day over which consumers differ in terms of their
most preferred time of departure. In all other respects, the spatial model remains as before.

Each consumer has an “address” indicating the consumer’s location on the circle and,
hence, the consumer’s most preferred product type. Each consumer is also willing to buy at
most one unit of a particular good. The consumer’s reservation price for the most preferred
good is denoted by _V_ . Different varieties of the good are offered by the firms that are also
located on Main Street—or, more appropriately, Main Circle. [14] A consumer buys from the
firm that offers the product at the lowest price, taking into account the costs of transporting
the good from the firm’s address to the consumer’s. We assume that these transport costs
are linear in distance. If the distance between a firm and a consumer is _d,_ the transport costs
from the firm to the consumer are _td,_ i.e., _t_ is the transport cost per unit distance. Recall that
in the nongeographic interpretation of the model, transport costs become the consumer’s
valuation of the loss of utility incurred by consuming a product with characteristics that are
not the consumer’s most preferred characteristics.

Suppose that there are five firms selling to a group of _N_ consumers who are distributed
evenly around the circle of circumference _L_ . A firm is differentiated only by its location
on the circle, and we assume that the distance between any two neighboring firms is the
same and equal to _L/_ 5. Each firm has identical costs given by _C(q)_ = _F_ + _cq,_ where _F_ is
fixed cost and _c_ is (constant) marginal cost. In contrast to our earlier merger analysis, we
do not set _F,_ the fixed cost, equal to zero, but instead set unit cost _c_ = 0. This simplifies
the analysis without losing any generality. What it does do is make it easy to talk about the
price-cost margin, which is now just price, denoted by _m_ for mill price. [15]


_No Price Discrimination_


We start by considering the case in which firms do not engage in price discrimination.
This means that each firm sets a single mill price _m_ that consumers pay at the firm’s store


13 A more general, but much more complicated version of this analysis can be found in Brito (2003).
14 It bears repeating that the spatial or geographic interpretation of this model is only the most obvious one.
15 If the reader is interested in working out the outcome for the case of _c_ ̸= 0 _,_ then we note here that in each
case that we examine, the equilibrium price _m_ [∗] that we derive should be replaced by _c_ + _m_ [∗] _._

or mill location. The consumer then pays the fee for transporting the product back to the
consumer’s location. The full price paid by a consumer who buys from firm _i_ is _mi_ _tdi,_
where _mi_ is firm _i_ ’s mill price and _tdi_ is the consumer’s transport cost (or the utility lost by +
this consumer in buying a product that is not “ideal”). Because marginal cost is zero, the
net revenue or profit margin earned by firm _i_ on every such sale is _mi_ . Consumers buy from
the firm offering the product at the lowest full price. As a result, for any set of mill prices
across our five hypothetical firms _(m_ 1 _, m_ 2 _, m_ 3 _, m_ 4 _, m_ 5 _)_ the market is divided between the
firms, as illustrated in Figure 15.2. The dotted lines indicate the market division between
the firms. Firm 1, for example, supplies all consumers in the region _(r_ 15 _, r_ 12 _)._

When the firms set their prices noncooperatively and the maximum willingness to pay
_V_ is relatively large, the market is completely covered. That is, every consumer buys from
some firm. Hence, the marginal consumer for any firm is the one who is just indifferent
between buying from that firm and buying from one of the firm’s neighbors. [16] We show in
the Appendix to this chapter that in equilibrium the mill price set by each firm is _m_ [∗] _i_

The market outcome is illustrated in Figure 15.3, in which we have “flattened out” the
circular market to simplify the geometry; that is, firm 1 is to the left of firm 5 and firm 5 is
to the right of firm 1. In Figure 15.3, the vertical distance is the effective price—mill price
plus transport cost—that each buyer pays. The sloped lines show that this price rises for
consumers who live farther from a firm.

Now consider a merger between some subset of these firms. The first point to note is
that, taking store locations or product choice as given, _such a merger will have no effect_

_unless it is made between neighboring firms_ . A merger, for example, between firms 2 and
4 leaves prices and market shares unaffected. More generally, this suggests that a merger
has no effect on the market outcome unless the market areas of the merging firms have
a common boundary. The reason is straightforward. The merging firms hope to gain by
softening price competition between them. This will happen only if, prior to the merger,
they actually compete directly for some of the same consumers. For example, the merger
of the two investment firms Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley was not for the most part
regarded as anticompetitive because the two firms market their services to different, or
non-neighboring customers of households and businesses.

Mergers between neighboring firms, however, _do_ alter the market outcome. Consider a
merger between firms 2 and 3. Suppose that after the merger, the firms do not change either
the locations of their existing products or the number of products they offer. Acting now
as a single corporate firm with stores in two locations, the merged firm has an incentive to
set prices to maximize the joint profits of both products 2 and 3, while the remaining firms
continue to price noncooperatively. Of course, firms 1, 4, and 5 also take account of the
fact that the merger has taken place. Because firms 2 and 3 are now cooperating divisions
of the merged firm they no longer compete for the consumers located between them and
so have an incentive to raise the prices of products 2 and 3. [17] This will likely lead to the
loss of some consumers, namely, those just on the boundaries identified by the points _r_ 12
and _r_ 34. But provided that the merged firm does not raise prices too much, the loss of
market share will be more than offset by the increased profit margins on their “captive”
consumers—the consumers between the two merging firms. Moreover, the increased prices
set by the merged firm will induce a similar increase in prices set by firms 1, 4, and 5. Such
a response reduces the loss of market share that the merged firm actually suffers making
the price increase all the more profitable.

Again we show in the Appendix that the merger leads to a new equilibrium with the
following prices:

17 If the merger leaves products 2 and 3 under the control of separate, competing product divisions, prices
will not change. The merged firms need to exploit the opportunity they now have to coordinate their
prices.

This equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 15.4. Comparison with equation (15.38) confirms
that this merger is profitable for the merging firms.

The equilibrium we have identified is based upon the assumption that the merged firms
leave their product lines unchanged after the merger. What do we expect to happen if we
relax this assumption? It turns out that the answer to this question depends upon the precise
nature of transport costs. Consider the product location choice facing the newly merged
firm 2 and firm 3. The firm faces a trade-off. On the one hand, relocating products 2 and
3 nearer to products 1 and 4, respectively, gives the merged firm two advantages. First, it
softens the competition between the merged firm’s own two product lines, so that when the
firm tries to reach out to customers near the boundary with a lower price, there is less of
a fear of simply “robbing Peter to pay Paul.” Second, the move also makes it easier for
the firm to steal some customers away from its true rivals, firms 1 and 4. [18] On the other
hand, relocating products 2 and 3 further from products 1 and 4 offers potential advantages.
Admittedly this gives up market share to the rivals but such a move also softens price
competition, leading to increased prices by all firms. In our example with linear transport

**Figure 15.4** Price equilibrium—after merger of firms 2 and 3


18 There is one complication that we have ignored in this discussion. Judd (1985) argues that a merger
that creates a multiproduct firm, as for example a merger of firms 2 and 3, may not be sustainable. The
intuition is as follows: Assume that an entrant comes in exactly at firm 3’s location after the merger of
firms 2 and 3. Price competition will drive the price for this product down to marginal cost, in which case
the entrant and the incumbent earn zero profits at this location (ignoring fixed costs). But the merged firm
also loses money at the neighboring location 2 because the price war with the new entrant forces it to
reduce the price there as well. If the merged firm were to close down its location 3 product, the entrant will
raise price above marginal cost, and so the merged firm can raise the price at location 2. There is, in other
words, a stronger incentive for the merged firm to exit location 3 than for the entrant to do so. Hence,
this kind of multiproduct merger may not be sustainable because it is not credible. This argument turns,
however, on two important assumptions: that entry costs are not recovered on exit and that the merged
firm has no incentive to try to develop a reputation for toughness. Note that in a vertically differentiated
context, it may turn out that the merging firms cease producing some versions of the good. See Norman,
Pepall, and Richards (2002).


Horizontal Mergers 409


costs, it turns out that the merged firm will wish to relocate its products closer to the rivals
2 and 3. On the other hand, if transport costs were quadratic, of the form _tdi_ [2] [the merged]

firms would actually want to relocate _further_ from their rivals. [19]

A merger between two firms in our spatial market is clearly advantageous to the merging
firms but is disadvantageous to consumers because a merger tends to raise prices throughout
the industry. Both merged and unmerged firms enjoy greater profit and consumers obtain
less surplus. There is a possible gain that could benefit consumers: when the merger leads
to cost savings that permit lower prices. Remember that the two products that are merged,
while not identical, are close substitutes. They could be, for example, low-sugar and highsugar versions of a soft drink. We might expect there to be some cost complementarities
in the production of these products. If so, then production of both goods by one firm will
be cheaper than production of both by two separate firms. In short, we should not be
surprised if in a product-differentiated market, production of many closely related product
lines exhibits economies of scope. [20]

Scope economies provide a strong incentive to merge. The merger allows the new firm to
operate as a multiproduct company and thereby exploit the cost-savings opportunities this
generates. These savings may be reflected in a reduction in fixed costs. For example, the
firms can combine their headquarters, research and development, marketing, accounting,
and distribution operations. If, in addition, the merger leads to a reduction in variable
costs of production, then this change will be reflected in lower prices. Moreover, even if
scope economies are not present, it is still possible that one of the merging firms has a
more effective purchasing division or a superior production technology that, following the
merger, will be extended to its new partners. The greater such cost synergies are, the more
likely it is that consumers will benefit from the merger.


_Price Discrimination_


Firms that operate in a spatial or product-differentiated setting clearly have some monopoly
power. Yet if firms have monopoly power, we might expect them to use discriminatory
pricing strategies to exploit this power. In particular, we might expect these firms to adopt
some of the price discrimination strategies that we developed in earlier chapters. We now
turn to the analysis of how price discrimination affects the incentives for and the impact of
mergers in a product differentiated market.

Suppose that firms adopt first-degree or personalized discriminatory pricing policies
but maintain at the same time the remaining assumptions of our spatial model in the
no–price-discrimination case. The noncooperative price equilibrium is then easy to identify.
Remember that firms compete in prices for customers. Accordingly, they set the price as low
as need be—at the margin—to attract customers, so long as that price covers their marginal
cost. As a result, the equilibrium must be characterized by the following condition. Suppose
that firm _i_ is the firm that can supply consumer location _s_ at the lowest unit cost, say _c_ + _ts_
(the marginal production cost plus transport fee), and that firm _j_ is the firm that can supply
this location at the next cheapest unit cost, _c_ + _ts_ + _e,_ where _e_ is a measure of how much
closer the consumer is to firm _i_ than it is to firm _j_ . The Bertrand–Nash equilibrium price
to consumer _s_ will be for firm _i_ to charge one cent or epsilon less than the cost of firm _j_ to
supply consumer _s_ ; that is, to charge just less than _c_ + _ts_ + _e_ .


19 A formal proof for the case of three firms is provided by Posada and Straume (2004).
20 Refer to Section 4.3 of Chapter 4 for a definition and explanation of economies of scope.

**Figure 15.5** Price equilibrium with price discrimination


The heavy shaded line in Figure 15.5 illustrates this price equilibrium. Firm 2 is the
lowest-cost supplier (including transport cost) for all consumers in the region _(r_ 12 _, r_ 23 _)_ .
Therefore, firm 2 supplies all consumers in this market region, charging its consumers on
the left one cent less than firm 1’s costs of supplying them, and its consumers to the right
one cent less than firm 3’s costs of supplying these consumers. By adopting this pricing
strategy, each firm earns a gross profit (profit before deducting fixed cost) given by the
shaded areas for their market regions in Figure 15.5.

An interesting feature of this set of discriminatory prices is that the highest price now
paid by any consumer is _c_ + _tL/_ 5. This was the _lowest_ price paid by any consumer when
firms did not practice price discrimination! Price discrimination in this oligopolistic market
unambiguously benefits consumers. Why is this? [21] With nondiscriminatory pricing, when
a firm reduces the price to one consumer, it has to reduce the price to every consumer—an
expensive prospect. With discriminatory pricing, by contrast, a firm can lower price in
one location without having to lower its prices elsewhere. But this means that price
discrimination weakens each firm’s ability to commit to a set of higher prices, making price
competition between the firms much fiercer and so leading to the lower prices that we have
just identified.

Now consider the effect on this equilibrium of a merger between two of these firms,
say firms 2 and 3, as before. Two points should be clear. First, as in the no–price
discrimination case, a merger of non-neighboring firms has no effect. Second, the merged
firm’s ability to coordinate the formerly separate pricing strategies is particularly valuable
in this discriminatory setting. This is because prior to the merger these firms were engaged
in what is nearly cutthroat price competition. By merging, the two firms can avoid this
expensive conflict, at least with respect to each other. [22] From the perspective of the merged


21 This is discussed in Norman and Thisse (1996). They show that with a given number of firms,
discriminatory pricing always benefits consumers. They also show, however, that the much more
competitive environment of discriminatory pricing may cause enough firms to want to leave the market
that prices actually increase for some consumers. See also Reitzes and Levy (1995).
22 There is a further important feature of this type of merger. The potential problems that we discussed
previously in footnote 18 cannot arise when firms charge discriminatory prices. Consider, for example, an
entrant coming in at product 3’s location. This would lead to the pre-merger price equilibrium in Figure
15.5 whether or not the merged firm removes its product at this location. There is, in other words, no
benefit to the merged firm in exiting from this market. Because a potential entrant can correctly anticipate
this, no such entry will take place.


Horizontal Mergers 411


firm, the nearest competitor for consumers in the region between firm 2’s location and _r_ 23
is now firm 1. Similarly, for consumers in the region between firm 3’s location and _r_ 23 _,_
the nearest competitor is now firm 4. As a result, the merged firm can raise prices to all
consumers located between firms 2 and 3, as indicated by the line _abc_ in Figure 15.5. A
merger of firm 2 and firm 3 increases the profits of the merging firms by an amount given
by the area _abcd_ . One further effect of this type of merger, which is not quite so intuitive,
is that when firms practice price discrimination the merger only benefits the merging firms.
Prices and profit increase only for those consumers who were served by the merged firm
prior to the merger. All other prices are unaffected, and so the profits of the nonmerging
firms are unaffected by the merger.

We could also consider issues regarding the merged firm’s product location strategies.
However, the basic point has been made. Our conclusions for the no–price discrimination
case hold all the more strongly when firms engage in discriminatory pricing practices.
Prices to consumers rise and the merging firms are more profitable. There is absolutely no
paradox about merging in this price discrimination case. From the viewpoint of the merging
firms a merger can be a highly profitable venture.

There is one final point to emphasize. Why is it that mergers with price competition in
a product-differentiated market do not run into the merger paradox that so bedeviled our
earlier analysis with homogenous products and quantity-setting firms? The first part of the
answer has already been suggested. Prices are strategic complements whereas quantities are
strategic substitutes. With price competition, therefore, the strategic responses of nonmerged
firms are potentially beneficial to the merged firms whereas with quantity competition they
are potentially harmful.

The second part of the answer is equally important and is related to the notion of credible
commitment. The reason why mergers are profitable in the spatial or differentiated products
context is that the merged firms can credibly commit to produce some particular _range_
of products—that is, the commitment required in the spatial context is a commitment to
particular locations or to continue marketing the products of the previously independent
firms. By contrast, the commitment necessary with homogenous products and quantity
competition must be in terms of production _levels_ . The merging firms must be able to
commit to a high volume of output following the merger. Generally, this is not credible
because such a high volume of production is not the merged firm’s best response to
a Cournot output decision by the other firms. If, however, the merged firm becomes a
Stackelberg leader then the commitment to a high level of post-merger output is credible.


15.6 PUBLIC POLICY TOWARD HORIZONTAL MERGERS


US public policy with respect to horizontal mergers has changed dramatically over the last
forty years. To a large extent, this change is reflected in the differences between the first
Merger Guidelines issued by the Justice Department in 1968 and the Merger Guidelines
currently in force. While it is tempting to summarize these differences as a move from a
very strict regime to a more permissive one, it is more accurate to describe the evolution
of merger policy as one that has increasingly become more sophisticated and that gives
greater recognition to the complexity of corporate organizations in the real world.

The 1968 Merger Guidelines relied heavily on market structure—particularly the fourfirm concentration ratio—to determine the legality of a proposed merger. Mergers would be
challenged in any industry in which the four-firm concentration ratio exceeded 75 percent


412 Contractual Relations Between Firms


and the merging firms each had a market share of as little as 4 percent. In markets with
a four-firm concentration ratio below 75 percent, mergers would be challenged if the two
firms each had market shares of 5 percent or more. Thus, under the 1968 Guidelines,
a combined share of as little as 10 percent would be sufficient in many cases for the
government to challenge a merger.

While the approach taken in 1968 reflected many years of empirical work within the
Structure-Conduct-Performance framework, its rigidity led to increasingly questionable
decisions culminating in perhaps one of the most controversial merger cases ever, _U.S. v._
_Von’s Grocery_ (1966) in which the Supreme Court upheld the government’s prohibition of
a merger between two grocery store chains in Los Angeles that, in combination, had less
than 10 percent of the market.

Ironically, courts began to deviate from the rigid, structure-based guidelines of 1968
almost as soon as they were adopted. One early such case was the acquisition by General
Dynamics of another coal producer, which was ultimately allowed by the Supreme Court in
1974 despite the fact that the combined market shares of the two firms clearly exceeded the
permissible levels set forth by the then 1968 Merger Guidelines. As the courts permitted a
number of similar mergers, it soon became clear that the 1968 Guidelines were no longer
compelling. This eventually led to the Justice Department issuing of a new set of Merger
Guidelines in 1982.

Under the new rules, reliance on the four-firm concentration ratio was abandoned in
favor of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HI). The threshold for intervention now became
an HI of 1,800 (a little more concentrated than an industry comprised of six, equally large
firms). Mergers in less concentrated industries would only be challenged if they raised the
HI by more than one hundred points and even then, only if the industry HI already exceeded
1,000. Subsequent amendments to the Guidelines in 1984, 1992, and 1997 relaxed even
more the constraints on mergers by specifying and enlarging the ability of merger-generated
cost efficiencies as a merger justification. [23]

Underlying these developments was an increasing awareness of modern industrial
organization theory as well as a growing body of empirical data that suggested many
mergers did not threaten competition as much as the Structure-Conduct-Performance
paradigm implied. Moreover the evidence on profitability of mergers was mixed as well.
Quite a long list of studies including Mueller (1982); Ravenscraft and Scherer (1989);
Lichtenberg and Siegel (1992); Loughran and A. Vijh (1997); Andrade, Mitchell, and
Stafford (2001), and Maskimovic and Phillips (2001) have found that mergers are not
terribly profitable—especially for the acquiring firm. Indeed, many acquisitions are later
reversed by “spin-offs.”

The change in attitude reflected by the 1982 guidelines has led to many more mergers being
permitted. These have included such major consolidations as Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific (railroads), AOL and Time Warner (telecommunications), Chase Manhattan and J.P.
Morgan (finance), Exxon and Mobil and also British Petroleum and Amoco (both petroleum
mergers), Westinghouse and Infinity Broadcasting (radio), Aetna and US Healthcare (health
services), MCI and WorldCom (telecommunications), Maytag and Whirlpool (laundry
machines), and XM and Sirius (satellite radio) among others. Many of these mergers were
controversial and virtually all raised some competitive concerns, nevertheless these were
approved.


23 For work on a theoretical approach to formulating generalized merger policy rules, see Nocke and
Whinston (2013) and works cited therein.


Horizontal Mergers 413


Public policy on mergers has increasingly made use of sophisticated empirical techniques
to estimate key market parameters and then to use these parameters to model the most
likely post-merger scenario. We briefly describe this process of merger simulation in
the next section. As developed by Werden and Froeb (1994, 2002) and extended by
Epstein and Rubinfeld (2002) merger simulation has become an important, albeit somewhat
controversial tool in merger policy. [See Slade (2007).]

In addition to a greater reliance on econometric evidence and economic modeling, policy
makers have taken two additional steps that permit horizontal mergers to be approved
despite some clear antitrust concerns. First, the antitrust authorities have increasingly used
a “fix-it-first” approach regarding proposed mergers. This procedure usually centers on
divestiture of some of the assets of the merging parties to another, third firm so as to ensure
that competitive pressures are maintained. If, for example, the two firms operate in several
towns across the country, but in one town they are the only two such suppliers, then the
government may permit the merger so long as one of the firms sells off its operations in
the town in question to a new, rival entrant firm. This principle was applied to approve the
2013 beer industry merger of Anheuser Bush Inbev and Grupo Modelo. It is often used in
the case of media mergers where newspaper and broadcasting firms have ben required to
sell their operations in certain locations before being permitted to conclude a merger.

Divestiture does have some problems. Cabral (2003) notes that divestiture allows the
merging firms to dictate the entry position for new rivals. If we think of the circle spatial
model described above, if two firms merge but sell the location of some of their stores to
a formerly excluded entrant, it means that entrant enters at the same location at which the
initial stores existed rather than at other locations on the circle that would be better for
consumers. Further, firms can act strategically to reduce the competitive threat presented
by divested stores. This occurred in 1995 when Schnucks Markets, a supermarket chain,
acquired National Food Markets, which was the major competitor of Schnucks in the
St. Louis area. The merger was approved when Schnucks agreed to divest twenty-four
supermarkets in the St. Louis area over the next year. However, no immediate buyer was
named. Schnucks then took the stores to be divested and proceeded to run them into the
ground. It closed departments. It kept the stores understaffed, and referred customers to the
other Schnucks stores that were not being divested. Soon, sales at the divesting stores had
declined by about one-third and, as a result, they posed less of a competitive threat to the
stores that the new Schnucks/National firm continued to operate. It was partly a response
to this case that led the FTC to require that the buyer of the divested plants be named
in advance and that the firm be one that has the industry knowledge to be an effective
competitor. This remedy does not, however, correct for the problems identified by Cabral
(2003).

A second, alternative procedure has been to approve mergers subject to behavioral
constraints on the merging firms, and then to follow this agreement with active monitoring
by government agents. Typically, these consent agreements require the firms to take specific
actions and to avoid engaging in certain practices. In monitoring these agreements, the
regulatory agencies can always count on a reliable source of outside help, namely, the
customers of the merged firms and all parties who opposed the merger. They are always
quick to report violations of the consent agreement. Since 1992, the number of consent
decrees issued by the FTC and the Justice Department has dramatically increased.

In addition to these procedural changes, the FTC and the Justice Department have also
continued to adjust the merger guidelines themselves. In this connection, an important
recent modification is the 1997 expansion of Section 4 of the guidelines to permit greater
