to be given by _f_ _[e]_ _vi_ . Each consumer will buy either one or no units of the good depending
on how the price _p_ compares with the consumer’s willingness to pay _f_ _[e]_ _vi_ . Specifically,
the demand by consumer _i_ for a hook up to the communications service is assumed
given by

Equation (22.1) makes clear that consumer _i’s_ willingness to pay for the service _f_ _[e]_ _vi_
increases with the fraction of potential buyers _f_ _[e]_ that are expected to buy it. It is this
interdependence between the willingness to pay and the fraction of the market that one
expects to be served that leads to network externalities. Note that all potential users of the
network consider only the value to themselves of joining the network. In particular, they
do not take into account the fact that by joining they will improve the usefulness of the
network to all of the other users because now the network is bigger.

We can use equation (22.1) to calculate the actual fraction _f_ of consumers who buy into
the service at any given price _p_ . As usual, we start by focusing on the marginal consumer
denoted by the reservation valuation� _vi_ . This is the consumer who is just indifferent between
buying into the service network and not buying into it, so that � _vi_ _p/f_ _[e]_ . All consumers
with a valuation less than� _vi_ will not subscribe to the service. The remainder will subscribe. =
Because _vi_ is distributed uniformly between 0 and 100, the fraction of consumers with a
valuation below � _vi_ is simply � _vi/_ 100. Hence, the fraction of consumers _f_ with valuations
greater than - _vi_ and who therefore acquire the service is


_p_

_f_ 1 (22.2)
=  - 100 [�] _[v][i]_ [=][ 1][ −] 100 _f_ _[e]_

If we now solve for _p_ we obtain the inverse demand function confronting the monopolist
expressed in terms of the fraction _f_ of the maximum potential number of customers who
actually buy the service as


_p_ = 100 _f_ _[e]_  - 100 _f_ _[e]_ _f_ = 100 _f_ _[e]_ _(_ 1 − _f )_ (22.3)

It may help to express equation (22.3) in terms of actual demand _Q_ . Recall that the total
number of potential customers is _N_ . Hence, _Q_ = _fN_ implying that _f_ = _Q/N_ . We may
therefore rewrite equation (22.3) as:


_p_ = 100 _f_ _[e]_  - 100 _f_ _[e]_ _Q/N_ (22.4)

For a given expected fraction _f_ _[e]_ (assumed common to all consumers), a given maximum
valuation of $100, and a given potential market size _N_, the demand equation (22.4), which
is mathematically equivalent to (22.3), describes a conventional downward-sloping inverse
demand curve with price intercept of 100 _f_ _[e]_ and slope of −100 _f_ _[e]_ _/N_ . Note though that the
position of the curve depends critically on the fraction expected _f_ _[e]_ to buy into the service.
That is, for any price _p_ the actual fraction of the _N_ consumers that buy into the service will
change as the faction _f_ _[e]_ expected to buy into it changes.

Because the demand curve depends critically on the expected fraction _f_ _[e]_ of service users,
we need to have some way of resolving the value of this parameter if we are to determine the


Network Issues 615


equilibrium outcome. For this purpose, we will assume that a full equilibrium requires that
the expected and actual fraction of users be equal _f_ = _f_ _[e]_, otherwise rational individuals
would be changing their expectations to eliminate their forecast error. This requirement
implies that in a full, rational expectations equilibrium, equation (22.3) may be rewritten as:


_p_ = 100 _f_  - 100 _f_ [2] = 100 _f (_ 1 − _f )_ (22.4)

This expectations equilibrium demand curve is illustrated in Figure 22.1. This diagram
also includes a horizontal line through the value _p_ = $22.22 _,_ which we shall explain later.

The curve shown in Figure 22.1 is interesting in a number of respects. Note first that for
all prices greater than $25, no equilibrium with a positive value of _f_ exists. If for some
reason, the monopolist must charge a price greater than $25, perhaps to cover fixed costs,
then the network will simply fail. This is true even though the network might be socially
efficient.

To illustrate, suppose that the monopolist incurs a fixed cost of $15 million to set up
the system but that the marginal cost of one more customer signing in is zero. This means
that when half the market _(f_ = 0.5 _)_ or 500,000 consumers are served, the firm has an
average cost of $15 _/_ 0.5 = $30 per customer. We also know, however, that if half the
population were to buy the product, it would be those consumers with _vi_ values in the



_vi_ value for this group is therefore $75.



range of $50 to $100. The average _vi_
=

50



_I_ =51



Hence, with _f_ = 0.5, the average actual willingness to pay across these consumers would
be $75 _/_ 2 = $37.50—enough it would seem to cover the $30 cost per consumer.

Yet as we have stated and as Figure 22.1 illustrates, the network will not be viable at a
price of $30. Why? Because while the average consumer valuation at _f_ = 0.5 is $37.50,
there are some current consumers (those for whom $50 ≤ _vi <_ $60) whose willingness to
pay is less than $30. As the price rises toward $30, these consumers drop the service. Some
(those for whom $50 ≤ _vi <_ $52) drop as soon as the price rises to $26, more drop as it hits
$27, and so on. The loss of these consumers, however, reduces the value of the network to

those remaining. Those who were previously just willing to pay $30 when the service had
500,000 subscribers, no longer will be willing to do so now that fewer people are signed
on. These consumers will also cease to purchase the product, reducing still further the
network’s value to the now even fewer customers left behind. This process will continue
until the entire market unravels and the network fails. Here, one can see the externality
quite explicitly. A consumer does not consider the impact of her choice to join or to leave
the network has on the value of the network to others.

We have not of course shown that $25 is the firm’s profit-maximizing price. All we have
shown is that no rational expectations equilibrium exists with _p >_ $25 and that the market
can suboptimally fail. Determining the monopolist’s profit-maximizing price (or output) is
tricky in this case because the quadratic quality of the demand curve means that we cannot
simply apply our standard twice-as-steep rule to determine marginal revenue. However, as
we show in the Appendix to this chapter, simple calculus quickly reveals that the optimal
price is $22.22. This points to a second common feature of network markets, namely, the
existence of multiple equilibria, with the result that one cannot be sure which outcome will
obtain.

As noted earlier, the horizontal line in Figure 22.1 is drawn through the value _p_ = $22.22,
i.e., through the monopolist’s profit-maximizing price. This line indicates the three rational
expectations equilibria associated with this price. The first is where the line intersects the
vertical axis at _f_ _[e]_ = _f_ = 0. If no one expects anyone else to subscribe to the service, no
one does. The second is where the line intersects the demand curve at _f_ _[e]_ = _f_ = 0.333,
an outcome we will refer to as the low-fraction equilibrium _fL(p)_ . The final possible
equilibrium occurs where price is again _p_ = $22.22 and _f_ _[e]_ = _f_ = 0.667, an outcome we
will refer to as the high-fraction equilibrium _fH_ _(p)_ . Which of these three might we expect
to occur?

Rohlfs points out that the low-fraction equilibrium is actually unstable. To see what
this means, consider, for example, a case in which the market is at this equilibrium with
_p_ $22.22 and _f_ _f_ _[e]_ _fL(p)_ 1 _/_ 3. Suppose that starting from this point, there is
= = = =
a small increase in the expected fraction _f_ _[e]_ to 0.40. At this value of _f_ _[e]_, the marginal
consumer is now given by: � _vi_ _p/_ 100 _f_ _[e]_ 22.11 _/_ 0.40 55.5. Because all consumers
with _vi_ values greater than this buy into the service, this implies that the actual fraction = = = _f_ of
subscribers would rise to _f_ = _(_ 100 − 55.5 _)/_ 100 = 0.445. In other words, the expectation
that _f_ _[e]_ = 0.40 would lead to an actual proportion _f_ = 0.445 even higher than expected.
This difference between the actual and expected network size cannot persist as it is not
an equilibrium. Sooner or later the reality of the higher actual fraction _f_ would lead
consumers to raise their expectations _f_ _[e]_ further as well. In turn, this would raise the
actual proportion _f_ higher still. This process will continue until the high proportion
equilibrium _f_ _[e]_ _f_ _fH_ _(p)_ 0.667 is reached at which point the expectation that 2 _/_ 3
= = =
of the population will subscribe induces precisely the same actual fraction of consumers
to subscribe. Analogously, if the expected fraction _f_ _[e]_ suddenly fell to 0.25, � _vi_ would fall
to � _vi_ _p/_ 100 _f_ _[e]_ 22.22 _/_ 0.40 0.888, implying that the actual fraction of subscribers
would fall below = _f_ = _[e]_ to _f_ = 0.112. Once again, this process would continue until the =
alternative equilibrium of _f_ _[e]_ = _f_ = 0 is reached. Thus, the low fraction equilibrium
_f_ _[e]_ _f_ _fL(p)_ 0.3333 is unstable in the sense that any small deviation away from
= = =
_f_ _[e]_ = 0.333 immediately leads the market to one of the two alternative equilibria.

It is straightforward to show that in contrast to the low-fraction equilibrium, both the
zero fraction and high fraction equilibria are stable. That is, deviations away from these
equilibria set in motion forces that tend to restore them. Therefore, it seems likely that one


Network Issues 617


of these two must ultimately prevail. Because there is no consumer or producer surplus
when _f_ _[e]_ _f_ 0, the high-fraction surplus of _f_ _[e]_ _f_ _fH_ _(p)_ 0.667 is obviously
= = = = =
preferable. There is however no guarantee that it will be reached. Yet if the market can
somehow reach the low-fraction equilibrium _f_ _[e]_ _f_ _fL(p)_, then it seems virtually
= =
certain that the high-fraction equilibrium will be attained because only a trivial increase
in _f_ _[e]_ (or a trivial decrease in _p_ ) is necessary to do so. For this reason, Rohlfs refers to
the fraction _fL(p)_ as a “critical mass” for the network. If _fL(p)_, can be established, the
network will grow to contain the high fraction, _fH_ ( _p_ ), of the population.

The critical mass _fL(p)_ is a key feature confronting firms in network markets. When
network firms compete, those that do not reach the critical mass are not just smaller. They
fail to survive at all. An important question therefore is whether and how the monopolist
can reach the critical mass. One possibility is to provide the service free for a limited
period of time, perhaps by bundling the service with some other product. Another option
is to lease the equipment to potential users with a promise to cancel the service with
no penalty if it does not achieve critical mass. A further possibility, one used when fax
machines were first marketed, would be to target groups of large users first. In this regard,
national and multinational companies or government agencies are the obvious examples
of institutions that might want to operate their own internal networks. Once the network
comes into common use for internal company communications, there may well be a
demand for it to be extended to those with whom the company does business. Before long,
this may grow into a demand by company users of the service for it to be available in
their homes.

How do the monopolist’s choices of _p_ = $22.22 and _f_ = 2 _/_ 3 compare with the social
optimum? Because that optimum requires that the market be as large as possible at a price
equal to marginal cost, it requires in this case that all _N_ consumers should be served, i.e.,
_f_ = 1. Clearly then the monopolist sets too high a price and serves too small a market.
Because we know that monopolies typically restrict output, this result should come as no
surprise. In this case though, there is a second reason for the market to be suboptimally
small, namely, the presence of the network externality. The fact that each consumer ignores
the impact of the decision to subscribe on the service valuation of other consumers, market
demand tends to be too low at any price. Even a competitive market will tend to under
produce a network good. Indeed, competitive firms may have difficulty coordinating on the
collective actions necessary to push demand beyond the critical mass.


consumer will buy at most one unit of the good depending on his or her willingness to pay.
However, that willingness to pay depends on the fraction _f_ of population that buys the

22.2 NETWORKS, COMPETITION, AND COMPLEMENTARY
SERVICES


While the Rohlfs (1974) model focuses on the provision of network services by a
monopolist, it makes clear many of the major difficulties that network externalities raise
when competition is considered. The market will generally be too small and could fail
altogether. Alternatively, there could be more than one equilibrium outcome and there is no
guarantee that the market will choose the best one. Indeed, the multiplicity of equilibria may
rise once competition is permitted. Further, and perhaps more importantly, competition in
network markets tends to be particularly fierce owing to the fact that gaining just a few more
customers raises the value of a firm’s network to all potential subscribers. We illustrate
these points below.

For example, suppose that there are two firms, firm A and firm B, competing for the
1,000,000-customer market above. Suppose further that while fixed costs are zero, each
firm now has a positive marginal cost of $11.11. Consumers buy the service of the network
that gives them the biggest net surplus, _fAvi_ _pA,_ and _fB_ _vi_ _pB_, respectively. In the case
of a tie, consumers are split randomly between the two services. One possible equilibrium − occurs with each firm setting a price _pA_ _pB_ marginal cost $11.11 and two-thirds
of the market being served. The firms offer identical products and, given the tie-breaking = = =
assumption, each serves half of the consumers ranging from valuations $33.33 and up.
However, because each firm individually serves only one-third of the market, the valuation
of the least valuable consumer in each case is _f vi_ 0.333 $33.33 $11.11. Neither
firm has an incentive to raise its price unilaterally. This would only lose customers and = × =
make its network even less valuable to consumers. Nor does either firm have an incentive
to lower its price. While this may give it an edge in attracting customers, each one served
now involves a loss as the firm would be selling below cost. Hence, _pA_ _pB_ $11.11
and two-thirds of market being served is one possible equilibrium. = =

However, there are a number of other possible outcomes. Clearly, one possibility is that
neither firm’s network attracts any customers at prices _pA_ _pB_ $11.11. Again, no one
will subscribe to a network to which no one else is expected to belong, and neither firm = =
has an incentive to sell below marginal cost. Yet two alternative equilibria also occur. They
arise when either firm A or firm B has a monopoly with respect to all consumers actually
subscribing to a network at the monopoly price while its rival has zero customers at a price
equal to or greater than marginal cost. We show in the appendix, for example, that with
a marginal cost of $11.11, the monopoly price would be $23.89 and that at this price, the
monopolist would serve about 60.5 percent of the market and earn a profit of $12.78 on each
customer. Suppose that firm A is doing precisely this while firm B is charging a lower price
but has zero consumers. Clearly, firm A has no incentive to raise or lower its price because
it already has set a price that maximizes its profit. Firm B has no incentive to change its
price either. Raising it surely will not help it attract any customers. Yet lowering it won’t
either because no one will choose a network that has no other customers regardless of
the price.

Price competition is also more intense in network markets. To see this, consider our
linear Main Street market with two firms located at either end of the one mile long street
and _N_ consumers distributed uniformly between them. Firm A is located at the west
end of town ( _x_ = 0) and firm B is located at the east end of town ( _x_ = 1). Each firm
has a constant marginal cost of _c_ . Each consumer buys at most one unit of the good


Network Issues 619



either from firm A or firm B and incurs a cost of _t_ per unit of distance travelled. Absent
network effects, the net surplus earned by a consumer at location _x_ is: _V_ - _tx_ - _pA_ if the
consumer buys from firm A, and _V_ - _t(_ 1 − _x)_ - _pB_ if the consumer buys from firm _B_ . _V_
is large enough that consumers always buy from one of the two firms, i.e., the market is
covered. Firms compete in prices, _pA_ and _pB_, respectively. The location of the marginal
consumer who is just indifferent between the two products is identified by _x_ _[m]_ . Because this
consumer gets the same surplus whether goods are bought from firm A to the west or firm
B to the east, we must have: _V_ _tx_ _[m]_ _pA_ _V_ _t(_ 1 _x_ _[m]_ _)_ _pB_ . In turn, this implies

In turn, this implies that the price equilibrium when there are network effects is:


_pA_ _pB_ _c_ _t_ _k_ [0 _< k < t_ ] (22.11)
= = +   
Comparison of equation (22.8) with (22.11) shows that equilibrium prices are definitely
lower when network effects are present. The reason is clear. The value to a firm of gaining
additional customers from one’s rival now is enhanced as that makes consumers more
willing to pay for the firm’s service. Competition between two or more firms to establish the
network can be particularly fierce if it is possible that only one firm or network survives, that
is, when the market has a “winner-take-all” feature. The winning network claims the entire
(served) population and the loser gets nothing. The market is “tippy” in that once a firm
starts to lose customers, the value of its product to the remaining customers falls, causing
it to lose more customers, its value to fall further, and so on. In such a setting, more than
market share is at stake. Survival itself is on the line. Moreover, while this “winner-take-all”
feature would greatly intensify the competition by itself, coupling it with an environment
in which pricing below cost may be necessary just to get any network started, makes the
competition truly nasty. Some economists have argued that it was precisely this dynamic
that was at work in the Microsoft versus Netscape case and that what may look like
predatory behavior when applied in other markets is really just normal competition when
applied in a setting of network goods. [3]

Market problems become particularly difficult when the network is a system comprised
of complementary components and when we consider what happens over time. Suppose for
instance that the network in question involves the market for Digital Versatile Disc (DVD)
movies. The two components to this network are the DVD player and the movie discs
themselves. This complementary relationship complicates the network effect. The desired


3 See Schmalensee (2000) for a clear statement of the view that competition in network or, (what he calls)
“winner take most” markets is likely to be extremely fierce and easily mistaken for predatory conduct
when practiced by a dominant incumbent.


Network Issues 621


outcome is for sufficiently wide use of DVD players and discs to achieve what appear
to be rather sizable scale economies that characterize production, especially disc-making.
However, no firm or group of firms will sink the large up-front costs necessary to produce
a lot of DVDs unless they are sure that there will be a substantial number of DVD players.
Yet consumers may be reluctant to purchase a DVD player until they are sure that there will
be a large number of films translated to DVDs for playing. In such a setting, one possibility
is that the market fails completely because of self-fulfilling expectations. If no consumer
expects DVD films to be widely available (or available at a low price), no one will invest
in buying a DVD player and, as a result, no firm will produce many DVD films. In turn,
this outcome will confirm the initial expectations, justifying the decision not to purchase
a DVD player. On the other hand, an alternative outcome is that each consumer expects
others to purchase DVD players and therefore anticipates that firms will find it worthwhile
to put films on DVDs. In this case, each consumer will purchase a player, inducing firms to
produce movie discs, which now confirms this more optimistic expectation. The network
externality in this case is reflected in the fact that as I buy a DVD player, I enhance the
value of your DVD machine because I increase the likelihood that there will be firms that
find it worthwhile to produce DVD films.

The DVD example also highlights another aspect of the multiple equilibria problem,
namely, the possibility that the particular equilibrium realized may be one in which the
market is “locked” into the wrong or an inferior technology. From a durability and volume
of information viewpoint, the DVD technology is an undoubtedly superior and less costly
way to provide movie rentals than is the VHS technology based on videocassettes and
VCRs. However, because the two systems are substitutes and because VHS was the first
system to get established, the DVD system needed to attract customers away from VHS
in order to gain a footing. It might have been the case that the number of customers so
attracted was not sufficiently large for the DVD manufacturers to exploit the available
scale economies and avoid losses. To reach that volume, each potential DVD consumer
needed not only to be convinced of the superiority of the DVD system but also to be sure
that others shared that conviction and were willing to act on it. In this case, purely by the
historical accident that the videocassette system was developed first, consumers could have
been locked into the inferior system. [4]

To put it somewhat differently, there is “path dependence” so that whichever system
eventually claims the market is the result of an arbitrary process, but one that “locks in” that
outcome for a considerable period of time. Instead of the VHS versus DVD example just
given, consider a closely related one from the earlier days of home video, namely, the VHS
versus Betamax versions of Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs). Imagine that 40 percent
of the population has a slight preference for VHS machines _if_ the price and market share
of these machines are identical to the price and market share of Betamax based products.
Similarly, the remaining 60 percent have a slight preference for Betamax. However, these
slight preferences can be overcome if one firm has a much larger market share because,
again, no one really wants to buy a network product if it does not have a very large network
of users. Finally, we assume that all consumers are not initially aware of the general home


4 David (1985) has argued that the standardized QWERTY keyboard used initially by typewriters and now
by all PC keyboards is an example of path dependent lock-in to an inferior technology, with the superior
one being the Dvorak keyboard. While Liebowitz and Margolis (1990) cast considerable doubt on this
argument, the case nevertheless makes clear that such market failure is a real possibility. See also, Arthur
(1989).

video market. Instead, they learn of it over time. Each week a few more consumers randomly
find out about home videos and decide to buy a VCR of either a VHS or Betamax type.

On average, we would expect each new wave of new consumers to be made up of 60
percent Betamax preferring consumers and 40 percent VHS preferring consumers. However,
it is quite possible that, picking randomly, one could get a batch of new consumers who
were comprising, say, 90 or even 100 percent of those who prefer VHS. Starting from a
point in which each system has equal market penetration, such a random draw could easily
tip the market heavily in favor of VHS. Once that happens, then even those with a slight
preference for Betamax will, in subsequent rounds, choose to buy a VHS machine because
that network is so much larger that many more films are going to be printed for it. Hence,
the small random draw favoring VHS may tip the entire market in favor of this technology
forever even though, at base, Betamax is the superior technology in that most consumers
favor it over VHS when all else is equal.

Similarly, Microsoft’s dominance may reflect just plain good luck as much as it does
superior technology. A key development in this regard came in 1980 when IBM decided to
enter the personal computer market in a major way. IBM awarded the contract for its disc
operating system to Microsoft and _MS-DOS_ was born. Some analysts think that Microsoft
did not have the best product at that time. Yet having the support of IBM was clearly a
major advantage in establishing a network of _MS-DOS_ users. Note that the network effect
gives Microsoft a strong defense against _Linux_ or _Apple_ or some other product even if it is
a better operating system than _Windows_ . Again, the lock in effect raises the possibility that
the market may adopt the inferior technology.


22.3 SYSTEMS COMPETITION AND THE BATTLE OVER
INDUSTRY STANDARDS


Competition between networks does not always leave just one survivor. The US has four
major credit card firms (Visa, Amercian Express, MasterCard and Discover). There is about
the same number of major wireless phone service provides (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and
T-Mobile). When we allow for the coexistence of two or more firms, each operating its own
network, a number of additional features enter into the analysis. In such cases, there is the
important issue of compatibility. To what extent will the industry adopt a standard product
design that enables consumers to “plug in” to any network? If a standard is adopted, what
standard will it be? In this section, we address these and related questions using a simple
illustrative model described below.

Consider, for example, the question of technology adoption. Assume that two firms have
to decide on whether to stick with their individual, existing technology or switch to a new
one. To be specific, suppose that the firms estimate the payoffs to their choices to be those
shown in Tables 22.1(a) and 22.1(b). The distinction between these two matrices is that in
(a) sticking with the old technology is less profitable jointly than incurring the installation
costs of switching to the new technology, while in case (b) both firms switching reduces
their joint profits.

The payoff received for either firm depends critically on what choice its rival makes.
However, there is also a further complication, namely, the issue of compatibility. Suppose
that the old technology and the new technology are incompatible in the sense that they
cannot be used together. This means that if each firm makes a different choice, they do
not derive any network benefits from being interchangeable with each other. By contrast,

if they choose the same technologies—whether old or new—then they do enjoy network
externalities. Such positive network externalities mean that the payoff to each firm if they
choose the same technology is greater than if they choose different technologies. This is
illustrated in the payoff matrices by the fact that the payoff to either firm when both firms
choose the same technology, no matter which, is greater than the payoff to either firm when
they choose different (incompatible) technologies.

Regardless of whether both would do best by switching to the new technology

[Table 22.1(a)], or both would do best by avoiding the cost of installing the new equipment
and sticking with the existing technology [Table 22.1(b)], it can be seen that there are two
Nash equilibria: one in which the two firms stay with the old technology, and the other in
which they both switch to the new technology. There is no simple way to pick between these
two equilibrium outcomes. If the payoffs are as in Table 22.1 (a) and so both switching is
efficient, each firm may nevertheless choose not to switch from fear of moving alone into
an incompatible technology. Farrell and Saloner (1985) refer to this as a case of excess
inertia. Alternatively, with the payoffs of Table 22.1(b), we might find excess momentum
with both firms making a costly switch to the new technology out of fear of being stranded
alone with the old technology.

There are, of course, ways by which the firms can attempt to avoid either of these
unsatisfactory outcomes. For example, the firms might be able to communicate their
proposed technology choices—and they have the incentive to do so honestly because lying
actually hurts both firms. Coordination may also be more likely if we extend this game over
many periods, because then a firm has the potential to correct a “wrong” choice, i.e., one
different from that of its rival. Nevertheless, even in these more general settings, Farrell
and Saloner show that firms may in particular delay switching technology longer than they
should. That is, rather than move promptly to introduce new technology soon, they may
wait unduly long until a sufficiently large “bandwagon” has built-up. Thus, some theater
owners and film producers in the 1920s did not invest in the equipment to show or to make
“talking pictures” until they were certain that the new phenomenon would catch on. As a
result, the advent of “talkies” may have been suboptimally delayed.


624 Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment


Compatibility is clearly an important factor in technological choice. However, there is
a drawback to compatibility. When each firm adopts the same technical standard, their
products become very close substitutes, and so price competition is likely to be intense.
Hence, while product differentiation by means of different technologies incurs the cost of
foregoing possible network effects it has the benefit of softening price competition. Firms
therefore have to make a judgment in this regard. Choosing the same technology will
lead the firms into direct, intratechnology competition of the type discussed throughout
the earlier chapters of this book—that is, competition on price, quality, and service.
By contrast, the choice of different technologies will lead the firms into intertechnology
competition.

Of course, if a firm can establish its technology as the industry standard, the rewards
from this kind of competition are likely to be very large indeed. When firms choose to
compete in different technologies, each is hoping that its technology will someday win the
market and become the industry standard. Think of Sony’s _PlayStation_, Nintendo’s _Wii_,
and Microsoft’s _Xbox_ . These three firms apparently regard the advantages of compatibility
to be more than offset by the disadvantages that it would bring in terms of intensified price
competition. As a result, the three systems are totally incompatible. Yet each hopes to win
the market and to establish its technology as the standard for which all applications, i.e.,
games are written.

There is no _a priori_ means of determining whether rewards will be greater under
intratechnology competition “within the market” or intertechnology competition “for the
market.” There are, however, three main possibilities that we should consider. We illustrate
these with three simple games: (1) Tweedledum and Tweedledee, (2) The Battle of the
Sexes, and (3) Pesky Little Brother. [5]


22.3.1 Tweedledum and Tweedledee


Assume that the payoffs for this game of technology choice are given in Table 22.2. There
are two Nash equilibria, in each of which the firms prefer to adopt incompatible technologies.
This implies that the firms believe that network externalities are not particularly strong
and that any gains from adopting a common technology will be more than offset by the
fact that this will lead to particularly fierce intratechnology price competition. They also
believe that a battle to establish the industry standard will not significantly delay its adoption
by potential consumers and so offers large rewards.

With these payoffs, each firm willingly enters into a battle to have its technology
established as the dominant one, i.e., each will push for the Nash Equilibrium that favors
its own product. In terms of the game matrix, firm 1 will fight to establish its technology as

from their discussion.


Network Issues 625


the “A” technology, thereby defining firm 2’s as the lesser “B” technology, and firm 2 will
do exactly the same. Besen and Farrell (1994) suggest four forms that this battle can take:


1. _Build on an Early Lead_ . If there are any network externalities at all associated with a
particular technology of the type we have discussed, there is considerable benefit to a
firm that succeeds in establishing a large installed base of current users. These users
will be reluctant to switch to a different technology. At the same time, the existence of
such a large installed base makes the technology attractive to new users. (Just think of
the choice that a new computer user has to make between buying an IBM compatible
running the _Windows_ operating system against a similar machine running _Linux_ or
an Apple computer with the _Apple_ operating system.) Under this scenario, there will
be intense price competition in the early stages of new technologies as each firm
attempts to capture as many customers as possible. Firms will also reveal and perhaps
exaggerate their sales figures in order to persuade potential buyers that a large installed
base already exists.
2. _Attract Suppliers of Complements_ . As we have pointed out many times, the attractiveness of a product is affected by the number of complementary products that are also
available. A computer is of little use except to the most advanced users unless there
is a wide range of computer software that will run on it. A Nintendo game machine
becomes more attractive as Nintendo or other firms expand the number of games it can
play. There is little point in owning a CD player unless recording companies offer a
wide range of recordings in CD format.

Owners of a primary technology such as Dell or Microsoft will likely encourage
software developers to produce a wide range of programs that will run on their
platform. Indeed, one reason that Apple lost its early lead in personal computers may
well have been its reluctance to have its operating system installed in clones. This
restriction limited the market penetration of Apple’s system and consequently reduced
the incentives of software developers to produce Apple-compatible software.
3. _Product Preannouncement_ . The owner of a particular technology can try to slow the
growth of a rival network by regularly “preannouncing” new products in advance of
their actual introduction. The idea is to discourage new buyers from choosing the rival’s
product with the promise of new “goodies” to come. The long-advertised arrival of
Microsoft’s _Vista_ program from 2004 to 2007 may have been in part an effort to attract
new buyers who might otherwise have started out buying an alternative operating
system. Such a strategy is not without risk, however. Announcing that a new version
of a dominant product that is just round the corner may not just cause some new
customers to delay their purchase of a rival’s product. It may also cause customers
already favorable to one’s existing product to delay their purchases as well.
4. _Price Commitments_ . A contractual commitment to achieve and maintain low prices
over the long term is a fourth method by which new consumers can be persuaded to
adopt a particular technology. This will be especially beneficial if the firm offering the
commitment knows that there are significant economies of scale or learning economies
in the manufacture of the primary product. In such circumstances, building a large
installed base early generates cost reductions that allow the firm to deliver on its low
price while maintaining its profitability.


In short, when rival firms compete to establish an industry standard, a variety of strategies
and outcomes emerge. Here again we find that such markets are ‘tippy,’ with multiple


626 Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment


equilibria in which the coexistence of incompatible products may be unstable. The tide of
battle can turn rapidly and quite suddenly a dynamic can develop that leads to a single
winning standard dominating the market. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the winner
will offer the best technology.


22.3.2 The Battle of the Sexes [6]


Rather than fight to have their own technology adopted as the industry standard, firms may
agree on the adoption of a common technology. The payoff matrix in this case is as in
Tables 22.3(a) and (b). The simplest case is that illustrated in Table 22.3(a). Here, both
firms are agreed that they should adopt technology 1. Accordingly, they should be able to
establish this technology as a common standard by simple communication between them.

In the case of Table 22.3(b), however, there is no such agreement. The firms would prefer
a common standard but they are not agreed on which of the two technologies the standard
should be. Firm 1 will fight to establish technology 1 as the standard, and firm 2 will fight
to establish technology 2. This is another instance in which commitment plays a crucial
role. Firm 1, for example, may be able to persuade firm 2 to accept technology 1 as the
standard by irrevocably committing itself to this technology. It could, for example, build an
installed base rooted in technology 1. Alternatively, it could invest in production capacity
to build more units embodying this technology, or establish a large R&D program devoted
to improving this technology. The common intent here is to broadcast the clear message
that firm 1 will never give in on its demand that technology 1 be the standard because to do
so would cost firm 1 too much.

Other possible commitments take the form of concessions rather than threats. Thus, firm
1 could offer to license technology 1 to firm 2 for a low fee in return for firm 2 agreeing
that technology 1 will be the standard. Alternatively, firm 1 can promise to develop the

an opera.


Network Issues 627


technology jointly, or it can suggest that the two firms develop a hybrid technology that
combines the best features of each.


22.3.3 Pesky Little Brother


In the “Tweedledum and Tweedledee” case, the two firms pursue inter-technology competition rather than adopt a common technology and confront each other in the market with
technologically undifferentiated products. In the “Battle of the Sexes,” each firm prefers
competition between technically compatible products, but the question of which technology
is the appropriate standard remains an issue. What these two cases have in common is that
there is some degree of consensus, if only on the terms on which competition between the
firms will occur. If, however, there are asymmetries between the firms, it may be impossible
for them to reach even this limited kind of consensus.

Assume, for example, that firm 1 has established a dominant position with a large
installed base and a powerful reputation. It will prefer incompatibility with a small rival in
order to hold its customers. The smaller rival, firm 2, will prefer compatibility in order to
derive benefits from the network that the larger firm has established. As Besen and Farrell
indicate, “The firms’ problem is like the game between a big brother who wants to be left
alone and a pesky little brother who wants to be with his big brother.”

The payoff matrix now looks something like Table 22.4. There is no Nash equilibrium
(in pure strategies) to this game if the firms make simultaneous choices—the two firms’
strategic choices are inconsistent. [7] Resolution of the game then comes down again to a
question of timing and commitment.

Suppose that the dominant firm must commit to its technology choice first. This is perhaps
the most plausible assumption, given that we have motivated the game by describing firm 1
as a preexisting firm with a large installed base. In this case, the smaller firm 2 may actually
enjoy a second-mover advantage. If firm 1 is committed to its existing technology either
because it is costly to change or because such change would lose firm 1 the guaranteed
patronage it now enjoys from its customers, it may be unable to prevent firm 2 from
following. In this case, firm 2’s clear choice will be to follow with a compatible system,
precisely the outcome firm 1 had hoped to avoid.

Two tactics might be available to firm 1 that would prevent firm 2 from imitating its lead
and offer firm 1 relief from its “pesky little brother.” These are: (a) aggressive protection
of its property rights and (b) changing its technology frequently. The first tactic relates to


**Table 22.4** The pesky little brother (in US dollars, millions)

|Col1|Col2|Firm 1|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|||_Technology 1_|_Technology 2_|
|_Firm 1_|_Technology 1_<br>_Technology 2_|12, 4<br>15, 2|16, 2<br>10, 5|



There is no (pure strategy) Nash equilibrium in simultaneous play. Firm 1, the
dominant firm (or big brother) prefers that the technologies be incompatible.
Firm 2 (the little brother) prefers that they be compatible.


7 With a game of this type with a finite number of strategies, there is always a Nash equilibrium in
mixed strategies in which the firms randomize their choice of technologies, but we shall not consider this
equilibrium.


628 Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment


the use of patents. If the technology the dominant firm has built up is protected by patents,
then imitation may be preventable through strict enforcement of the protection such patents
give and by building up a stock of sleeping patents that make it difficult for a smaller firm
to invent around the current technology.

Alternatively, firm 1 can try to hamper firm 2’s imitation efforts by changing its
technology frequently. This, of course, can be expensive and runs the risk of alienating
users of the existing installed base unless they can be protected by, for example, being
given favorable access to the new generation of products. The advantage to this approach
is that the target at which the smaller rival is aiming is constantly shifting in ways that are
difficult for the small firm to predict. If you really want to avoid your pesky little brother,
don’t tell him where you are going!

In short, competition over technology has a variety of implications. Often, there may be
large social gains from all firms adopting a common technical approach. But the incentive
for firms to differentiate their products, as well as the rivalry over which technology should
become the industry standard, can frequently thwart the realization of such gains. While the
gains from price competition are generally clear, the network externality effects make the
gains from technology competition more ambiguous.


22.4 NETWORK GOODS AND PUBLIC POLICY


Our analysis of network services suggests many ways in which the market mechanism may
fail to produce an efficient outcome. In some cases, a socially desirable service may fail to
be provided. In other cases, multiple possible outcomes raise the possibility that the market
may choose the wrong equilibrium and lock into an inferior technology. Competition may
not be a feasible market structure. Moreover, even where feasible, competition may not
be a remedy for these failures. To the contrary, competition may intensify the rush to a
particular standard or technology, which later is realized to be inferior. Competition may
also lead firms to reject compatibility even when it might actually be desirable. When the
market will only support one system or network, competition is likely to be very intense
and border on predatory conduct. How should public policy deal with these issues?

It is important to understand that in many respects, the problems raised by network effects
are not new. The presence of dramatic scale economies and externalities have long been
recognized as potential sources of market failure. Large scale economies make marginal
cost pricing unlikely because such large scale economies means that marginal cost is below
average cost over a wide range of production. Further, even when it is possible to operate at
a sufficiently large size that all the scale economies are exploited, doing so will likely imply
that there is room for only a few firms. Similarly, externalities always imply a divergence
between private and social benefit (or cost) with the result that market outcomes based on
the maximizing choices of individuals and firms are not likely to be optimal.

Saying that the problems raised by network effects are not new, however, is not the
same thing as saying that they are easy. Three problems are particularly difficult in
the case of network goods. The first of these is the problem of detecting or proving
anticompetitive behavior. The second is the difficulty of devising an appropriate remedy
once anticompetitive actions have been identified. The third is determining the proper role
that the government should play in coordinating the technology choices of different firms
with a view towards achieving standardization.

Consider the problem of determining anticompetitive tactics. The presence of network
externalities requires that the developer of a new product such as a facsimile machine sell
to a large number of consumers in order to establish any market at all. In turn, this may well
mean pricing below cost, at least initially. This may result in a competitor being driven out
of the business. When later, the winning firm raises its price so as to earn a return on its
investment, the historical record of selling below cost, eliminating a rival, and then raising
price looks a lot like a case of predatory pricing. Indeed, such a record is essentially the
evidence called for by Baumol (1979) to determine predation. (See Chapter 12.) Yet such a
finding may simply reflect the need to price low so as to penetrate the market and the fact
that the market can only support one supplier.

Similarly, the developer of a platform such as _Windows_ or _Wii_ or a DVD player requires
that there be a large number of applications (programs, games, or films) available at a low
cost in order to gain wide acceptance of the overall system. One way to achieve this aim


630 Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment


is to produce and market such complementary goods itself. Yet to the extent that one can
only play Nintendo _Wii_ cartridges on a Nintendo _Wii_ machine the market outcome begins
to look like illegal tying or possibly an attempt at foreclosure. To borrow from an example
earlier in the text, Microsoft’s _Windows_ almost certainly gained from the availability of a
compatible, low-cost web browser. Yet Microsoft’s decision to bundle its _Explorer_ browser
with _Windows_ raised substantial concerns of tying with a view to driving Netscape out of
the browser business. [8]

With regard to technology adoption and product improvement, the case of Microsoft is
again relevant. Sun Microsystems’ _Java_ programming language offered the possibility of
greatly enhancing the functionality of _Windows_ . However, this required that _Windows_ be
made compatible with _Java_ . Microsoft was generally reluctant to do this at least in part
because there was a widespread view that _Java_ could provide the basis for an alternative
applications platform if it ever became widely accepted. Making it compatible with _Windows_
would have this effect. So, while providing that compatibility might greatly improve the
technology available for PC users, it might also provide an opportunity for entry to a new
rival. Does Microsoft’s reluctance in this case reflect an illegal effort to deter entry? [9]

As difficult as it is to identify anticompetitive behavior in network or systems markets,
devising an appropriate remedy when such actions are discovered is perhaps even more
problematic. The just mentioned case of Microsoft and Sun Microsystems is instructive in
this connection. Is the appropriate policy to force Microsoft to make _Windows_ compatible
with _Java_ ? Adoption of such a policy would place the government in the awkward position
of pushing a particular technology, and it is far from clear that the government has the skill
to do this well. What if _Java_ really does not offer any real improvement on the _Windows_
product? Indeed, what if there is an alternative programming language that would offer
much greater enhancement? That alternative may never break through if antitrust officials
require that _Windows_ work with _Java_ . In other words, antitrust policy may also result in an
inferior technology lock-in.

This raises the general question as to the proper role for the government in coordinating
the technology choices of different firms with a view toward achieving widespread
standardization. Consider the market for mobile telephone service. Relatively early on, the
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) imposed a requirement that cell
phone service providers adopt GSM as the 2G standard to be used throughout Europe.
Consequently, a British resident traveling on the continent was able to use a mobile phone
to make calls in Italy just as easily as at home in the United Kingdom. This was much
less feasible for US residents at that time, in part, because no centralized authority had
acted to coordinate the digital standards of American mobile phone companies. Instead,
US mobile service providers initially adopted four different standards that left interservice
communication quite difficult, if not impossible. However, competition between these
different standards spurred further technical development. Indeed, this advantage was
implicitly recognized by ETSI when it later chose to adopt the American-based CDMA
standard for 3G systems. [See Cabral and Kretschmer (2007).]


8 This point was made forcibly by Schmalensee (2000). See Fisher (2000) for an opposing point of view.
Note that if Schmalensee’s argument is that in some industries, e.g., web browsers, only one firm can
survive, this is really a statement that such a market is a natural monopoly. The only difference is that
here the scale economy lies on the demand side via the network externality. See also Eisenach and Lenard
(1999).
9 Microsoft and Sun eventually did reach an agreement of sorts, but Sun was never happy with it and the
agreement was later abandoned.

22.5 EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: NETWORK EXTERNALITIES
IN COMPUTER SOFTWARE—SPREADSHEETS


As noted earlier, computer software such as operating systems and web browsers are likely
to exhibit important network effects. Users care about being able to run their programs
on the computers of their friends or business associates. The more people using a specific
software package or the more compatible a software package is with add-on programs, the
more valuable it should be. Gandal (1994) offers empirical evidence of this phenomenon
from the early days of desktop computing.

A spreadsheet was initially a pencil-and-paper operation. Essentially, it was a large sheet
of paper with columns and rows organizing all the relevant data about a firm’s transactions.
Its name comes from the fact that costs or revenues connected to a specific operation were
spread or displayed over the sheet in a manner allowing sums over a given row or column.
In that way, management is able to focus on a specific factor, say energy costs, in making
an informed decision about company operations. The advantage of a spreadsheet format
is that if a given cost factor or revenue assumption is changed, decision makers can trace
through the implications of this change rather quickly. However, there is a natural limit
to the speed of such adjustments when spreadsheets are “hard copy” and changes must be
made by hand.

Beginning about 1980, electronic spreadsheets suitable for use on desktop computers
began to make their commercial appearance. The first of these was _VisiCalc (Visible_
_Calculator)_ . Computerization greatly enhanced the speed with which managers could
assess the impact of cost or revenue changes. It thereby greatly increased the usefulness of
spreadsheets in daily operations. Demand for such products grew and so did the supply.
Soon, there were a number of spreadsheet programs including _SuperCalc_, _VP Planner_,
_PlanPerfec_, _Quatro Pro_, _Multiplan_, _Excel_, and _Lotus 1-2-3_ .

These early products differed both from each other and over time. The earliest versions
had very limited, if any, graphing abilities. Some could link entries in one spreadsheet to
others in another spreadsheet. Some could not. Only a few were able to link with external
data and incorporate that data into the spreadsheet cells directly. The most flexible of all
was the _Lotus 1-2-3_ program. Throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s, this was
the dominant product. Indeed, an important attribute of other spreadsheet programs was
whether or not they were _Lotus_ compatible.

Gandal (1994) notes that spreadsheet demand will likely exhibit network effects for a
number of reasons because users like to be able to share their information and the results
of their spreadsheet analyses with each other. Gandal then identifies three features of a
spreadsheet program that should promote such networking. The first is whether or not the
program was compatible with _Lotus 1-2-3_, the dominant product. This is measured by a
variable _LOCOMP_ equal to 1 if the program is _Lotus_ compatible and 0 if it is not. The
second network attribute is _EXTDAT_ . This is a variable that takes on the value 1 if the
program can import files from external data sources and 0 if it cannot. The final network
feature is another 1, 0 variable _LANCOM_ that indicates whether or not the program can link
independent users through a local area network.

Gandal (1994) hypothesizes that if network externalities were present in the early
spreadsheet market, then a program’s market price will be higher if it has any of
the three features just described, i.e., when for that product, any of the variables
_LOCOMP, EXTDAT,_ or _LANCOM_ is positive. A function that specifies how product price
changes as the product’s attributes change is known as an hedonic function. Estimating such


632 Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment


functions is usually done by ordinary least squares (OLS) in an hedonic price regression.
Gandal (1994) gathered data for ninety-one computerized spreadsheet products over six
years: 1986 through 1991. His basic regression equation is:



ln _pit_ _α_ 0 _α_ 1 _TIME_ 87 _t_ _α_ 2 _TIME_ 88 _t_ _α_ 3 _TIME_ 89 _t_ _α_ 4 _TIME_ 90 _t_ _α_ 5 _TIME_ 91 _t_

+ + + +



_γ_ 1 _LOCOMPit_ _γ_ 2 _EXTDATit_ _γ_ 3 _LANCOMit_ _εit_
+ + + +



The dependent variable is the natural log of the price of spreadsheet model _i_ in year _t_ . Not
including the constant, the first five variables are time dummy variables equal to 1 in the
year that is indicated by the dummy and zero otherwise. These variables pick up the pure
effects of time on spreadsheet program prices while holding the quality attributes fixed. The
next four variables are variables that pick up specific features that should add to the value
of a spreadsheet program. _LMINRC_ is the natural log of the minimum number of rows
or columns that the spreadsheet can handle. This is meant to capture the sheer computing
power of the program. _LOTUS_ is a 1, 0 dummy variable indicating whether the product
is a _Lotus_ spreadsheet. This term captures any brand premium that _Lotus_ enjoyed during
these years. GRAPHS is a 1, 0 dummy variable indicating whether or not the program
can construct pie, bar, and line graphs. _WINDOW_ indicates the number of windows a
program can handle on a screen simultaneously. Of course, the final three variables are the
networking effects described earlier. If there are network externalities, the coefficients on
these variables should be significantly positive.

Gandal’s (1994) results are presented in Table 22.5, shown below. The first regression
shown is the estimated hedonic equation described above. Note that all the attributes hypothesized to raise the value of a spreadsheet program do in fact exert a significantly positive
effect on its price. There is a strong brand premium for _Lotus_ . There is an almost as strong
premium for programs that have graphing abilities. Most important of all, however, the
three networking variables are very strongly positive. _LOCOMP, EXTDAT,_ and _LANCOM_
all have a substantial positive effect on a program’s price.

Regression 2 shows the effects of allowing the coefficients to change over time. Gandal
(1994) splits the sample in half and adds as regressors, values of the independent variables
multiplied by 1 if the observation comes in the second half of the sample. Most of these interacted variables are not significant. However, the coefficients on both _MINRC and LINKING_
do change over time as indicated by the coefficients on _TMINRC and TLINKING_ . These
coefficients are interpreted as the difference between the marginal value of these features
in the first half of the sample and that value in the second half of the sample. Note that this
regression includes _TLANCOM_ but not _LANCOM_ . This is because connecting to local area
networks was generally not possible for any program prior to the second half of the sample.

Gandal (1994) prefers Regression 2 as the better specification of the hedonic price
equation. Note again that it implies strong network externalities. The coefficients on
_LOCOMP, EXTDAT,_ and _TLANCOM_ are all very significantly positive. Consumers are
willing to pay a lot extra for spreadsheets that others can use either because they are _Lotus_ compatible, can easily import data from external programs, or can exchange information
over a local area network. These effects are powerful. Because the dependent variable is
the log of the price, the coefficient is easily interpreted as the percentage increase in price

a consumer would pay for that feature. Thus, being _Lotus_ -compatible raised the price of a
spreadsheet program by 66 percent according to Gandal’s (1994) estimates. A program’s
ability to import data from an external source raised the price by 57 percent.

A frequent use of hedonic price regressions is to construct price indices that trace the
movement of a commodity’s price over time. This is often difficult to do because we do not
have an easy way to adjust for quality. A television set today may cost much more that a
television set from ten years ago. However, it would be wrong to interpret all of that price
increase as inflation because today’s television set has many more features than that of an
earlier set such as high definition, DVD compatibility, and a flat screen, to name just a few.
Because the hedonic regression controls explicitly the value of quality features, it permits
the easy construction of a quality-corrected price index by focusing on the changes that
are due simply to the passage of time, i.e., holding quality constant. In Regression 1, these
changes are fully captured by the year specific dummies. Because the dependent variable is
ln _pit_, the predicted price for a spreadsheet of constant quality in any year: _pit_ _e_ _[α][t]_ _[YEA][R][t]_
so the YEAR _t_ variable is the dummy for that observation and _αt_ is the coefficient estimated =
for that dummy. If we normalize so that the price index _Pt_ is 1 in the first year of 1986, then
equation 1 says that the price index will be _e_ [−][0.06] in 1987; _e_ [−][0.44] in 1988; and so on. For
Regression 2, constructing the quality-adjusted price index is slightly more complicated
because the value of the some of the attributes also changes over time, but the basic
idea is the same. We present Gandal’s (1994) estimated spreadsheet price indices for both
regressions in Table 22.6, below. It indicates that over the six-year period for which Gandal
(1994) collected data, the quality-adjusted price of spreadsheet programs—like the price of
much software and hardware in this time period—declined substantially. Here, the decline
exceeded 50 percent.

**Summary**



In this chapter, we have focused on the product
markets exhibiting important “network externalities.” In such markets, the value of the good or
service to any one consumer increases as the total
number of consumers using the product increases.
Services with important network effects, such as
telecommunications and home electronics, play
an increasingly large role in modern economies.

Markets with strong network effects present
special problems. Competition to establish a network service can be unusually fierce, leading to
low prices that can be difficult to distinguish from
predation. Often, such competition will result in
only one firm surviving so that the market’s ultimate structure is one of monopoly. There is also
a nontrivial risk that the service will be underdeveloped or not developed at all. Similarly, the


**Problems**


1. Two banks compete for the checking and
savings deposit business of a small town.
Each bank has its own ATM network that
works only on its own bankcards, but bank
1 has three times as many ATM machines as
bank 2. Depositors value a bank’s services
as an increasing function of the number of
machines on the network. Bank 2 approaches
bank 1 and suggests that they merge their
ATM networks so that depositors of either
bank can use either bank’s machines.


a. Is this merger in the interest of deposit
consumers in general?
b. Do you think that bank 1 will agree with
bank 2’s proposal?


2. Assume that consumers contemplating buying a network service have reservation prices
uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 50]



course of technical development exhibits a path
dependency in which the market may eventually
lock into an inferior technology.

There are no easy solutions to the problems
raised by network goods. On the one hand, the
possibilities for anticompetitive outcomes seem
sufficiently clear that such markets necessarily
invite examination by the antitrust authorities.
Yet it must also be acknowledged that it is not
easy either to identify anticompetitive actions
clearly or to devise workable remedies to the
market failures to which network services are
prone. Such tensions have dominated the debate
over policies regarding the telecommunications
industry and other “new economy” markets in the
past. They will no doubt continue to be important
in the future.

a. Calculate the demand function for this
service.
b. What is the critical mass if price is set at
$5?
c. What is the profit-maximizing price for
the service?



3. Many social customs exhibit network effects.
To this end, consider a party given by a group
of individuals at a small university. The
group is called the Outcasts and has twenty
members. It holds a big party on campus
each year. These parties are good, but are


especially good the more people are in attendance. As a result, the number of people who
actually come to the Outcasts party depends
on how many people are expected to attend.
The more people that are expected to attend,
the more fun it will be for each attendee
and, hence, the more people who actually
will come. These effects are captured by
the following equation: _A_ = 20 + 0.95 _A_ _[e]_ .
Here, _A_ is the number of people actually
attending the party. This is equal to the 20
Outcast members plus 0.95 times the number
of partygoers _A_ _[e]_ that are expected to go.

a. If potential party attendees are sophisticated and understand the equation
describing actual party attendance, how
many people are likely to attend the
Outcasts party?
b. Suppose that each party attendee costs
the Outcasts $2 in refreshments so that
the Outcasts need to charge a fee _p_ for

attending the party. Suppose as well that when
going to the party requires paying a fee, the
equation for attendance is: _A_ = 20 + 0.95 _A_ _[e]_ _p_ . What value of _p_ should the Outcasts set
if they want to maximize their profit from the
party? How many people will come to the party
at that price?


4. Two firms are competing in their choice of
technologies. The payoff matrix for the game
between them is given below:

a. Identify constraints on the payoffs a–h
that are such that the firms’ choices
reflect network externalities.
b. Assume that the constraints in (a) are
satisfied. Identify further constraints that
must be satisfied for the game between
the two firms to be of the form

i. Tweedledum and Tweedledee;
ii. The Battle of the Sexes;
iii. The Pesky Little Brother.

## **The Profit-Maximizing Network Access Price** **for a Monopolist**


PRICE FOR A MONOPOLIST


Let _N_ potential consumers be ranked in terms of their valuation _vi_ for a good when all
consumers are expected to buy, with _vi_ distributed in the interval [0,100]. The anticipated
surplus any buyer receives given the expected fraction _f_ _[e]_ of subscribers is: _Si_ _[e]_ _i_

Equation (22.3), then implies: [=] _[ f][ e][v]_ [−] _[p]_ [.]


_p_ = 100 _f_ _[e]_  - 100 _f_ _[e]_ _f_ (22.A1)

The monopolist’s revenues _pQ_ = _R(Q)_, and costs _C(Q)_ are given respectively by:

_R(Q)_ = 100 _f_ _[e]_ _fN_  - 100 _f_ _[e]_ _f_ [2] _N_ and _C(Q)_ = _F_ + _cQ_ = _F_ + _cfN_ ; _F, c_ ≥ 0 (22.A2)

In any full expectations equilibrium we have _f_ _[e]_ = _f,_ so that _R(Q)_ = 100 _f_ [2] _N_ - 100 _f_ [3] _N_ .
Combining equations (22.A1) and (22.A2) with _f_ = _f_ _[e]_ _,_ implies profit of:

_π(f )_ = 100 _f_ [2] _N_  - 100 _f_ [3] _N_  - _F_  - _cfN_

The necessary first-order condition for profit maximization is:


_dπ(f )_

0 200 _f_ 300 _f_ [2] _c_ 0
_df_ = ⇒   -   - =

When _c_ = 0, the solutions are: _f_ = 0; and _f_ = 2 _/_ 3. When _c_ = $11.11, they are:
_f_ = 0.0612 and _f_ = 0.6055 _._


# **23** **Auctions: Basic Theory and Applications**

Historians of the Roman Empire often refer to the year 193 AD as the year of the five
emperors. [1] Following the death (by assassination) of Emperor Commodus in 192, the famed
Praetorian Guard had arranged for the appointment of Pertinax as the new Roman emperor.
However, Pertinax proved to be more honest and more devoted to the ascetic ways of
former emperor, Marcus Aurelius, than the Guard had expected. In particular, Pertinax
did not give the Guard the generous financial reward they deemed appropriate in return
for proclaiming him emperor. Dissatisfaction grew quickly. Although he escaped an initial
coup, his inability to placate the Guard led to a final confrontation on March 28, 193, in
which Pertinax was killed. Then followed what Roman consul and historian, Dio Cassius,
called “a most disgraceful business” in which “both the City and its entire empire were
auctioned off.” [2] The winner of this auction was Didius Julianus who ruled as emperor for
an equally short time until his own assassination and decapitation prior to the ascension of
Emperor Septimus Severus.

Of course, auctioning off cities and empires is a rare event. These days, however, the use
of auctions is widespread. From the sale of master art works to the market for government
bonds to the millions of transactions at on-line sites such as e-Bay, the auction process
has become an increasingly common mechanism for awarding ownership and contracts.
Indeed, it is probably the leading example of the market mechanism and economics articles
and textbooks frequently refer to the “Walrasian auctioneer.” [3]

It is somewhat surprising then that development of the formal theory of auctions and
auction behavior is comparatively recent. However, the last two decades have made up for
this with an explosion of auction research. In this chapter, we review some of the basic
results of auction theory. We then show that analysis of auctions offers more than just
formal theoretical insights into auction design and bidding strategies. It also offers some
deep insights into imperfect competition. [4]

23.1 AUCTIONS: A TAXONOMY


Auctions may be categorized along two dimensions. One dimension concerns the auction
design—the rules regarding bidding and what the winning bidder pays. The second
dimension concerns the nature of the bidder valuations of the item(s) being auctioned. One
possibility is that these valuations are totally private. Each individual bidder has his or her
own willingness-to-pay for the item, totally unrelated to what others are willing to pay
for it. The alternative is a common value auction. In this case, each individual may have
an independent idea regarding an item’s true worth, but ultimately that item has a market
value that is common to all buyers.

Regarding auction design, there are four basic types: the English or ascending auction,
the Dutch or descending auction, the first-price sealed bid auction, and the second-price
sealed bid auction. This last case is sometimes referred to as a Vickrey auction in honor of
the pioneer of auction theory, Nobelist William Vickrey. The rules for each of these auction
designs are described below.

The English, or ascending, auction is essentially the type used by the Praetorian Guard.
Bidders call out ever increasing bids until just one bidder remains. The last bidder then
wins the auctioned good. The Dutch, or descending, auction is similar except that it works
in reverse. In this case, the auctioneer starts with a high price and continues to lower it until
a buyer is found. Both the English and Dutch auctions are open in the sense that bidders
can observe each other’ actions.

In contrast, the first-price and second-price sealed bid auctions are closed auctions. In
each of these cases, bidders submit sealed or private bids for the item and the highest bid
wins. In neither case do bidders observe the bids of others. The difference between the two is
that in the first-price sealed bid auction, the winner pays precisely what was bid, while in the
second-price case, the winning bid pays an amount only so high as the second-highest bid.


23.2 PRIVATE VALUES AUCTIONS AND THE REVENUE
EQUIVALENCE THEOREM


All auctions, but perhaps most especially English ascending auctions are characterized by
strategic interaction. Every bidder knows that the chances of winning the auction and the
price that will be paid if the bidder does win is profoundly affected by the bids made
by others. Precisely for this reason, it is natural to view auctions through the prism of
game theory and to determine the auction’s outcome by determining the Nash equilibrium
strategy combination for this game. This is the approach adopted here.

We begin with the study of auctions in which bidders have independent private values.
This analysis is relatively straightforward but it does require some work. That effort is
worthwhile because the insights from private value auctions are substantial. Further, it
is much easier to understand the key features of common value auctions once one has a
foundation in auctions with private values.


23.2.1 Equilibrium Bidding Strategies in English and Second-Price
Private Value Auctions


It is readily apparent that if bidders bid their true valuations, the English ascending auction
and the second-price or Vickrey auction are formally identical. Suppose for example that
