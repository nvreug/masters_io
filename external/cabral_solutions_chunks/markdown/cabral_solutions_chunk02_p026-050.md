(b) The monopoly pro¯t function is given by


¼m = Qp(Q) ¡ C(Qi) = Q(150 ¡ 4Q) ¡ 40Q:


The ¯rst order condition for pro¯t maximization is given by:


150 ¡ 8Q ¡ 40 = 0: (2)


Solving with respect to Q we get Q = 13:75, and then p = 95.
Under perfect competition the prevailing price would be given by marginal cost: p = 40;
total quantity would be Q = 27:5 and welfare


W = CS = [[][p][(0)][ ¡][ p][]][Q] = 1512:5:

Under duopoly, total welfare is given by:


Wd = 2¼ + CS = 2q(p ¡ c) + [p(0) ¡ p]q = 1344:38:


Under monopoly, total welfare is given by


Wm = ¼ + CS = (p ¡ c)Q + [[][p][(0)][ ¡][ p][]][Q] = 1134:375:

Finally, the duopoly e±ciency loss as a percentage of the monopoly e±ciency loss is given
by



EL = [1512][:][5][ ¡][ 1344][:][38]



1512:5 ¡ 1134:375 [= 44][:][5]



7.6 [¤¤] Show analytically that equilibrium price under Cournot is greater than

price under perfect competition but lower than monopoly price.


Solution: In a Cournot oligopoly, ¯rm i's pro¯t is given by ¼i = qiP (Q) ¡ C(qi), where
Q is total output. The ¯rst-order condition for pro¯t maximization is given by


d P
P (Q) + qi ¡ MC = 0: (3)
d qi


The ¯rst-order condition for a monopolist is given by

P (Q) + Q d Q [d P] [¡][ MC][ = 0][:] (4)


Finally, under perfect competition we have


P (Q) ¡ MC = 0:


26


[d P] [d P]

d qi [=] d Q



Notice that [d P]



Notice that d qi [=] d Q [<][ 0. Consider the case of oligopoly and suppose that price is equal]

to monopoly price. Monopoly price is such that the (4) holds exactly. The only di®erence

between (3) and (4)is that the latter has Q instead of qi. Since Q > qi, it follows that, for p

equal to monopoly price, the left-hand side of (3) is positive. Finally, if it is positive, each

¯rm has an incentive to increas output, which results in a lower price.

By a similar argument we can also show that price under Cournot competition is greater

than marginal cost.



7.7 [¤¤] Consider a duopoly for a homogenous product with demand Q = 10¡P=2.
Each ¯rm's cost function is given by C = 10 + q(q + 1). Determine the values of the

Cournot equilibrium.


Solution: Duopolist i's pro¯t is given by ¼i = qip(Q) ¡ C(qi) = qi[20 ¡ 2(qi + qj)] ¡ 10 ¡
qi(qi + 1). The ¯rst order condition for pro¯t maximization is given by:


20 ¡ 2(qi + qj) ¡ 2qi ¡ 2qi ¡ 1 = 0: (5)


The problem of duopolist j is symmetric, therefore we have qi = qj = 2:375 and p = 10:5.


8.1 Explain why collusive pricing is di±cult in one-period competition and easier

when ¯rms interact over a number of periods.


Solution: In one-period competition each ¯rm has a strong incentive to deviate from

the pre-agreed collusive price, since the gains from deviating are higher than the losses. In

terms of the example in Section 8.1, had the duopolists interacted in only one period, the

gain would be given by one half of monopoly pro¯ts, while the loss from deviating would be

0. We would then be led to the usual Nash-Bertarand equilibrium when both ¯rms price at

marginal cost.

If, however, ¯rms interact over a number of periods, history, in the form of past pricing

behavior, becomes important. Deviation from the collusive price in one period can be met

by punishment (deviation) in future periods. Hence, the original defector must weigh short
term gains against long-term losses, made possible exactly by multi-period interaction.


8.2 After several years of severe price competition that damaged Boeing's and

Airbus' pro¯ts, the two companies have recently pledged that they will not sink into

another price war. However, in June 1999, Boeing made an unusual o®er to sell 100

small aircraft to a leasing corporation at special discount prices. (Although customers


27


never play list prices, it was felt that this deal was particularly attractive.) Boeing's
move follows a similar one by Airbus. [1][4]


Based on the analysis of Section ??, why do you think it is so di±cult for aircraft

manufacturers to collude and avoid price wars?


Solution: Aircraft manufacturers receive orders infrequently. Moreover, the terms of each

sale are seldom made public. For these reasons, it is very di±cult for them to collude. The

incentive to cheat on a tacit or explicit agreement would be very high because: (a) the short

run is very important with respect to the long run (low discount factor); (b) the probability

that cheating would be detected is low.


8.3 [¤] In a market with annual demand Q = 100 ¡ p, there are two ¯rms, A and
B, that make identical products. Because their products are identical, if one charges

a lower price than the other, all consumers will want to buy from the lower-priced

¯rm. If they charge the same price, consumers are indi®erent and end up splitting

their purchases about evenly between the ¯rms. Marginal cost is constant and there

are no capacity constraints.
(a) What are the single-period Nash equilibrium prices, pA and pB?
(b) What prices would maximize the two ¯rms' joint pro¯ts?

Assume that one ¯rm cannot observe the other's price until after it has set its

own price for the year. Assume further that both ¯rms know that if one undercuts

the other, they will revert forever to the non-cooperative behavior you described in

(a).

(c) If the interest rate is 10%, is one repeated-game Nash equilibrium for both

¯rms to charge the price you found in part (b)? What if the interest rate is 110%?

What is the highest interest rate at which the joint pro¯t-maximizing price is sus
tainable?

(d) Describe qualitatively how your answer to (d) would change if neither ¯rm

was certain that it would be able to detect changes in its rival's price. In particular,

what if a price change is detected with a probability of 0.7 each period after it occurs?

Note: Do not try to calculate the new equilibria.

Return to the situation in part (c), with an interest rate of 10%. But now suppose
that the market for this good is declining. The demand is Q = A ¡ p with A = 100 in
the current period, but the value of A is expected to decline by 10% each year (i.e.,
to 90 next year, then 81 the following year, etc.).

(e) Now is it a repeated-game Nash Equilibrium for both ¯rms to charge the

monopoly price from part (b)?


Solution:


(a) Given that there is plenty of capacity to serve the entire market, each ¯rm will be willing
to undercut the other to make all the sales in the market so long as p > 10. The one-shot
Nash equilibrium is for both ¯rms to charge p = 10, the \Bertrand trap."


14The Wall Street Journal Europe, June 11{12, 1999.


28


(b) The greatest pro¯ts possible are found at the monopoly price. The capacity expenditures are

sunk. A monopoly would set Q so that MR = MC . In this case, MC is 10. So the collusive
outcome would split the market and price at 55. p = 100 ¡ Q ) MR = 100 ¡ 2Q: MR =
MC ) 100 ¡ 2Q = 10 ) Q = 45 ) p = 55.
Assume that each ¯rm can monitor the other's price very closely and can respond in
stantly (before any consumers make a purchase decision) to a price change.


(c) Yes, one equilibrium is to stay at the monopoly price. If both ¯rms are at the monopoly

price, then each faces the following decision: \Assuming that the other ¯rm will continue

to charge the monopoly price, should I charge the monopoly price also, or should I charge

slightly less today, knowing (believing) that we will then revert to p = 10 forever after?"
Charging the monopoly price means getting half the monopoly pro¯ts forever, which is

worth PDV cooperate = (1 + 1=r)(55 ¡ 10)45=2 = 11137:5 when the interest rate is 10%.
Alternatively, PDV cheat = (54:99999¡10)45 = 2025. The logical conclusion is that it pays to
cooperate inde¯nitely if you believe that the other ¯rm will also. If, however, PDV cooperate <
PDV cheat then the monopoly price would not be sustainable. PDV cooperate < PDV cheat )
(1+1=r)(55 ¡ 10)45=2 < 2025 ) r > 100%. At any interest rate above 100%, the monopoly
price would not be sustainable. Interest rates above 100% are rare, assuming that detection

lags are on the order of weeks or months, so it looks like monopoly price could persist in

this market.


(d) If the probability of being detected is less than one, then a company that cheated would

have a chance of getting the high pro¯ts of cheating for more than one period before it got

caught. This would raise the incentive to cheat and lower the interest rate at which the

monopoly price is sustainable. In fact, one can think of a detection probability of 70% as

corresponding to an interest rate of 30% (added on top of whatever interest rate applies

based on the time value of money).


(d) Declining demand generally makes cooperative pricing more di±cult to support. The rate

of decline acts much like a discount rate on future earnings, since the cost to a ¯rm of

\cheating" in the current period, namely the loss of its share of future pro¯ts, is less in

a declining market. However, a rate of decline of \only" 10% acts much like raising the

interest rate by 10% (from 10% to 20% here), which is still safely below the interest rate

at which cooperative pricing breaks down (assuming perfect detection and continuing to

assume that these \grim trigger" strategies are credible punishments for cheating).


8.4 [¤] You compete against three major rivals in a market where the products

are only slightly di®erentiated. The \Big Four" have historically controlled about

80% of the market, with a fringe of smaller ¯rms accounting for the rest. Recently,

prices have been rather stable, but your market share has been eroding slowly, from

25% just a few years ago to just over 15% now. You are considering adopting an

aggressive discounting strategy to gain back market share.


29


Discuss how each of the following factors would enter into your decision.

(a) You have strong brand identity and attribute your declining share to discount
ing by your rivals among the Big Four.

(b) The Big Four have all been losing share gradually to the fringe, as the product

category becomes more well known and customers become more and more willing to

turn to smaller suppliers to meet their needs.

(c) Your believe your rivals are producing at close to their capacity, and capacity

takes a year or two to expand.

(d) You can o®er discounts selectively, in which case it will take one or two quar
ters before your rivals are likely to ¯gure out that you have become more aggressive

on pricing.

(e) Your industry involves high ¯xed costs and low marginal costs, as applies for

most information goods.

(f) The entire market is in rapid decline due to technological shifts unfavorable

to this product.


Solution:


(a) Discounting can cheapen your brand image and identity, but may be worthwhile if you still

have relatively large margins and thus ¯nd it pro¯table to halt your slide in market share.

Since the discounting is from other members of the Big Four, an aggressive response on your

part, perhaps followed by an exploratory price increase, might signal that you will ¯ght to

avoid losing market share but are willing to accept today's shares if your rivals raise prices

somewhat.


(b) There is little you can do about this problem, since the fringe is hard to control in any

way, and entry of new fringe players is not likely to be very di±cult. This is the situation

to emphasize your brand and to try to segment the market to retain your share of those

customers willing to pay a premium for a well-known brand (yours!).


(c) Generally, you can be more con¯dent pushing prices up if rivals are at or near capacity.

You will lose some sales, assuming that industry demand is not perfectly inelastic, but you

will lose little or no customers to your rivals in the short run (a year or two) if they cannot

expand production. Of course, if fringe ¯rms are viewed as o®ering close substitutes, and do

not face capacity constraints, then the capacity limitations faced by the other major players

don't help you much at all.


(d) Such \detection lags" always make discounting look more attractive, simply because any

competitive responses will be delayed. Indeed, it seems that this is exactly how you lost

market share, to rivals who were discounting before you realized what was going on.


(e) Now discounting is more attractive because marginal cost is low, so setting marginal cost to

the marginal revenue (associated with your residual demand curve) involves a lower price.

Plus, even if you can engage in "cooperative pricing," the resulting price is lower, the lower

are marginal costs.


30


(f) In a declining market, the future is relatively less important commercially relative to the

present. In terms of our theories of \cooperative pricing," declining demand is much like

a higher interest rate: the scale tips more towards maximizing current pro¯ts and away

from a \patient" approach of sacri¯cing short-run pro¯ts to support or sustain long-run

cooperation. So, discounting now to avoid a further loss of market share (or to gain market

share back) looks more attractive in a declining market, even if this will trigger or in°ame

a price war.


8.5 \Price wars imply losses for all of the ¯rms involved. The empirical obser
vation of price wars is therefore a proof that ¯rms do not behave rationally." True

or false?


Solution: False. As Section 8.2 shows, price wars may be part of the equilibrium of a

game played between rational ¯rms.


8.6 Empirical evidence from the U.S. airline industry suggests that fare wars

are more likely when carriers have excess capacity, caused by GDP growth falling

short of its predicted trend. Fare wars are also more likely during the Spring and

Summer quarters, when more discretionary travel takes place. [1][5] Explain how these

two observations are consistent with the theories presented in Section ??.


Solution: The ¯rst model in Section 8.2 (secret price cuts) predicts that price wars start

in periods of unexpected low demand. This is consistent with the ¯rst observation above.

However, the e®ect of unexpected low demand is also consistent with a theory of price wars

caused by ¯nancial distress (see the end of Section 8.2). The observation that prices fare

wars take place during periods of higher demand is consistent with the second model in

Section 8.2 (demand °uctuations).


8.7 A 1998 news article reported that


Delta Air Lines and American Airlines tried to raise leisure air fares 4%

in most domestic markets, but the move failed Monday when lone-holdout

Northwest Airlines refused to match the higher prices.

The aborted price boost illustrates the impact Northwest's woes already

are having on the industry. Months of labor unrest . . . are prompting
passengers to book away from the fourth largest carrier. [16]

Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Microeconomics), 205{276..
16The Wall Street Journal Europe, August 12, 1998.


31


What does this say about the nature of price dynamics in the airline industry?


Solution: The event seems consistent with the view, presented at the end of Section

8.2, that price wars are asymmetric in nature. In this case, they are caused by ¯rms, like

Northwest Airlines, that are in ¯nancial distress.


8.8 In the third quarter of 1999, most North American paper and forest-products

companies experienced an improvement in their results. The industry, analysts said,

was in a cyclical upswing: not only was demand increasing at a moderate pace; more

importantly, the industry practiced restraint in keeping low production levels, thus
providing support for higher prices. [17]


How do you interpret these events in light of the models presented in Section ???


Solution: The analysis of Section 8.1 predicts that collusion is easier in growing industries

(the promise of future pro¯ts under collusion is worth more). This is consistent with the fact

that \restraint in keeping low production levels" took place during the \cyclical upswing."


8.9 In 1918, the U.S. Congress passed a low allowing American ¯rms to form

export cartels. Empirical evidence suggests that cartels were more likely to be formed

in industries where American exporters had a large market share, in capital-intensive

industries, in industries selling standardized goods, and in industries that enjoyed
strong export growth. [18] Discuss.


Solution: The e®ect of export growth seems consistent with the analysis in Section 8.1.

The e®ect of standardization may correspond to the fact that it is easier to monitor collusion

with a standardized product (however, the e®ect of product di®erentiation on collusion is a

controversial issue). The e®ect of market share is consistent with the analysis in Section 8.3

(concentration facilitates collusion).


8.10 The endowments of the Ivy League universities have increased signi¯cantly

in recent years. Princeton, the richest of all, boosted its endowment from $400,000

per student in 1990 to more than $750,000 in 1997. In the same period, both Harvard

and Yale more than doubled their endowments. Notwithstanding these riches, the

universities have restrained from using ¯nancial incentives as a means to compete for

18

32


students. For many years, the manual of the council of Ivy League Presidents stated

that the schools should \neutralize the e®ect of ¯nancial aid so that a student may

choose among Ivy Group institutions for non-¯nancial reasons." In 1991, the Justice

Department argued that this amounted to price collusion and forced the agreement to

end. However, no signi¯cant price competition took place until 1998, when Princeton

University started o®ering full scholarships for students with incomes below $40,000.

Stanford, MIT, Dartmouth and Cornell followed suit. Allegedly, Harvard sent a letter

to accepted 1998 applicants stating that \we expect that some of our students will

have particularly attractive o®ers from the institutions with new aid programs, and
those students should not assume that we will not respond." [1][9]


How do you interpret these events in light of the theories discussed in this chapter?


Solution: If the Department of Justice was right in assuming the council manual's clause

was an explicit form of price collusion, then what happened after 1991 is that collusion

ceased to be explicitly supported by the clause and turned into tacit collusion. In fact, the

analysis in Chapter 8 suggests that explicit, contractual arrangements are not necessary to

sustain a collusive agreement. The chapter also states that, under tacit collusion, each ¯rm

balances the short-run bene¯ts from deviation against the long-term cost of entering into

non-cooperative play. The fact that endowments have increased so much (especially Prince
ton's) may be what has tipped the balance in the direction of giving away full scholarships.


8.11 Based on data from the Spanish hotel industry, it was estimated that the

rate set by hotel i in market k is positively in°uenced by a variable that measures the

intensity of multimarket competition between hotel i and its competitors in market
k: the more markets m 6= k in which ¯rm i and its competitors meet, the greater the
measure of multimarket contact. It was also observed that the measure of multimarket
contact is highly correlated with hotel chain size, that is, the larger hotel i's chain,
the greater the measure of multimarket contact for ¯rm i. [2][0]

Provide two interpretations for the positive coe±cient of multimarket contact on
hotel rates, one based on collusion, one based on a di®erent e®ect.


Solution: When interaction between oligopolists takes place over a number of periods, it is

easier to sustain collusion: long-term losses weigh more compared to short-term gains from

deviation. Multimarket contact adds another \dimension" to the balance between gains and

losses. A ¯rm's gain from deviating in one market may be punished by its competitors in

all the markets they meet, making the potential cost from deviation higher. However, the

optimal behavior of the deviating ¯rm would call for deviation in all markets. Thus, we have

higher losses from deviating but also higher gains. As discussed in Section 8.3, if everything


19The Economist, December 5, 1998.
20


Fern¶andez, Nerea, and Pedro Mar¶³n (1998), \Market Power and Multimarket Contact: Some Evidence
from the Spanish Hotel Industry," Journal of Industrial Economics 46, 301{315..


33


is identical (¯rms, markets) then, multimarket contact does not increase the likelihood of

collusion because the potential gains from deviation increase in the same proportion as

the losses. However, asymmetries between ¯rms or markets can make losses weigh more

than gains, thus increasing the likelihood of collusion. This justi¯es the positive correlation

beteween multimarket contact and average rates.

There is, however, an alternative interpretation. Maybe rates are higher in hotels of

greater size. This could happen either because consumers attach a greater value to hotels

that have larger chains or because bigger hotel chains command greater (unilateral) market

power. Given the empirical correlation between hotel size and multimarket contact this

would also imply a correlation between multimarket contact and rates, even if there is no

implicit or explicit collusion between hotel chains.


8.12 Consider the following excerpt from a 1998 news item. [2][1]


LONG-STALLED SHIPPING REFORM BILL TAKEN UP BY SENATE.

Washington | The Senate has formally begun consideration of a shipping

reform bill that, if passed, would create changes for all countries shipping

manufactured goods to and from the United States . . .

Until now U.S. shipping law has been founded on the principle of common

carriage | \Everybody pays the same tari® (rate) to go from Oakland to

Yokohama," said the Department of Transportation (DOT) o±cial, who

asked not to be identi¯ed. Under this system, groups of liners called

conferences | legal cartels with immunity from antitrust law | set the

rates for their members and make those rates public through registration

with the federal government. If the shipping bill passes, however, liners

could make private, con¯dential deals with exporters-importers outside of

conferences at market-set rates.

\This is going to bring marketplace economics into ocean shipping like

we've never seen before," the o±cial said. \It's going to really change the

in°uence of ocean shipping conferences in the marketplace." . . .

The Transportation Department o±cial said the Clinton administration

has generally supported legislation for shipping reform in line with its

promotion of deregulation in airlines and trucking, but has stated concerns

about speci¯c provisions of the Senate bill. Probably the administration's

biggest concern is a provision of the bill allowing conferences also to engage

in con¯dential contracting, he said. \In the administration view that

conveys too much market power to the conferences," the o±cial said.


Do you agree with the Clinton administration's view? Why or why not?


Solution: The example in Box 8.6 shows that making information public is not a panacea

to the collusion problem. Although the market becomes more transparent, and collusive


21USIA *EPF513 04/03/98, written by USIA Sta® Writer Bruce Odessey.


34


agreements are easier to monitor, this may come at a cost: It gives ¯rms the opportunity

to coordinate on a collusive equilibrium.

The approach taken by the U.S. Senate in its shipping reform bill is to switch from a

public information exchange to the possibility of secretly priced individual/group contracts.

The idea is that, although we may end up with a collusive equilibrium that is di±cult to

detect, this equilibrium is likely to feature price wars in order to be sustainable (cf Section

8.2). In the shared information approach, collusion is probably easier to detect but ¯rms

may (tacitly) coordinate on a higher price collusive equilibrium.


8.13 In 1986, the U.S. Congress enacted a regulation (PL99-509) requiring

railroads to disclose contractual terms with grain shippers. Following the passing of

the legislation, rates increased on corridors with no direct competition from barge

tra±c, while rates decreased on corridors with substantial direct competition. [22] How

do you interpret these events?


Solution: One possible interpretation for these results is that, when there is no competition

to railroad shipping, there is potential for collusion among railroad operators, whereas the

opposite is true when there is direct competition from barge tra±c. In this context, increased

information about railroad contracts has the e®ect of

1. improving collusion among railroad operators when the latter have no competition.
This is consistent with the idea that when price cuts are di±cult to observe collusion
is more di±cult to sustain.
2. increasing competition in markets where railroad operators compete with barge operators. This is consistent with the idea that, in a competitive environment, better
information about prices increases demand elasticity (consumer are more aware of
price di®erences) and thus decreases margins.


8.14 [¤] Consider an n ¯rm homogeneous-good oligopoly with constant marginal
cost, the same for all ¯rms. Let ± [¹] be the minimum value of the discount factor such
that it is possible to sustain monopoly prices in a collusive agreement. Show that ± [¹]

is decreasing in n. Interpret the result.


Solution: Let ¼ [M] be total industry pro¯ts. Under the collusive agreement, each ¯rm

receives ¼ [M] =n. If one of the ¯rms undercuts its rivals, then it gets approximately ¼ [M] .

Finally, if ¯rms revert to a (perpetual) price war each ¯rm gets zero. It follows that the

35


condition such that it is an equilibrium for ¯rms to price at the monopoly level is given by


1 ¼ [M]

¸ ¼ [M] :

1 ¡ ± n


Solving with respect to ± we get

± ¸ [n][ ¡][ 1] :

n

It follows that collusion is stable if and only if ± > ± [¹] ´ [n][¡][1]

n [. (Note that the condition is]
independent of the value of ¼ [M], so the same condition would apply for any level of collusion.)
Taking the derivative of ± [¹] with respect to n, we get


d ± [¹] [n][ ¡][ (][n][ ¡][ 1)] = 1=n [2]              - 0:
d n [=] n [2]


It follows that ± [¹] is increasing in n. In words, the more ¯rms there are, the more di±cult

it is to sustain a collusive agreement. The idea is that the relative gain from cheating is

greater the greater the number of ¯rm (the pro¯t from cheating is always the same, but the

pro¯t from collusion is lower the greater n is).


8.15 [¤¤] Consider the model of multimarket contact presented in Subsection ??.

Determine the minimum value of the discount factor such that the optimal collusive

solution is stable.


Solution: The setting of the problem consists of Firms 1 and 2, and Markets A and B.

Firm 1 has cost c in Market A, while Firm 2 has a cost of ~~c.~~ The situation is reversed in

Market B. Demand is the same both markets. It is assumed that c < ~~c~~ < p [M] .

As discussed in section 8.3 the e±cient collusive agreement is the following: In each

market, the ¯rm with a cost advantage sets the monopoly price, while the other sets a

higher price and sells 0. Let us use the following notation: ¼ [M] represents the monopoly
pro¯t of the ¯rm with cost advantage, ¼ [M][ 0] = ¼(p [M] ¡ "; ~~c)~~ is the pro¯t of the ¯rm with high

marginal cost when it charges (slightly less than) the monopoly price and ¼ [C] = ¼( ~~c;~~ c) is

the pro¯t of the ¯rm with low cost when it charges a price equal to the other ¯rm's costs.

In the e±cient collusive agreement each ¯rm gets:


1
¼ [M] + ±¼ [M] + ± [2] ¼ [M] + ::: = ¼ [M] (1 + ± + ± [2] + :::) = (6)
1 ¡ ± [¼][M][ 1]


If a ¯rm decides to deviate, it will do so only in the market where it has a cost dis
advantage, since in the other market it already earns monopoly pro¯ts. Suppose that the

punishment for deviation is be for both ¯rms to engage in a price war so that the prevailing

price in each market is ~~c.~~ If Firm 2 deviates in Market A, then it gets ¼ [MC] in that market


36


in the ¯rst period, plus 0 from then on; and ¼ [M] + ±¼ [C] + ± [2] ¼ [C] + : : : in the other market.

The situation is symmetric. Therefore, the deviating ¯rm's total pro¯ts are given by:


±
¼ [MC] + ¼ [M] + ±¼ [C] + ± [2] ¼ [C] + ::: = ¼ [MC] + ¼ [M] +
1 ¡ ± [¼][C][:]


The stability condition requires:


1 ±
1 ¡ ± [¼][M][ ¸][ ¼][MC][ +][ ¼][M][ +] 1 ¡ ± [¼][C][:]


This gives the minimum value for the discount factor:


¼ [MC]
± = ¼ [MC] + ¼ [M] ¡ ¼ [C] [:]


9.2 Based on data from local cement markets in the U.S., a series of regressions

were estimated for seven years in the period 1948{1980. Each regression has the form

price = ¯ ¢ C4 + (other variables). The coe±cient ¯ was estimated to be positive
in ¯ve of the seven years considered, negative in the remaining two. How can these

results be explained?


Solution: It was shown in Section 9.1 that, under the assumption of Cournot competition,

the higher the number of ¯rms in the market, the lower price and the lower allocative

ine±ciency. Moreover, the more concentrated an industry (the smaller the number of ¯rms),

the easier is to sustain collusion. These arguments suggest that when market concentration

(as measured by C4, for example) is greater equilibrium price is further apart from the

competitive price (the structure-performance hypothesis).

However, as pointed out in Section 9.2, reverse causation is an important problem.

If one assumes that market structure is endogenously determined (i.e., entry is possible)

and market price is exogenous, then we obtain that a high price would induce entry from

other ¯rms and consequently decrease in concentration|a negative relation between the

two variables.

relation was estimated:

rt = 0:098 + 0:814 mt;


where rt is the interest rate charged by commercial banks and mt is the money

market rete, that is, the interest rate that banks must pay to borrow in the short

term. The standard deviation of the second coe±cient estimate is .0878. Knowing

that the money market interested rate is highly correlated with the marginal cost of

giving out loans, and knowing that H is approximately .125, what can you say about

market power in this sector?


37


Solution: Applying the equation on p. 161, we get


1

µ = [1][ ¡][ 0][:][814]

0:814 :125 [= 1][:][828]


This value is higher than Cournot (1) but lower that perfect collusion (1=H = 8). Another

way of evaluating the result is to consider what the result would be under Cournot. From

Table 9.2, we get that, under Cournot,


H 1
» =
1 + H [=] 1:125 [=][ :][888]


The statistical test that the estimated coe±cient is greater than the Cournot value would

correspond to the value (.888-.814)/.0878=.84. Although we don't have complete informa
tion about sample size, etc, this is a relatively low value. The conclusion is that behavior is

between Cournot and collusive behavior but not statistically di®erent from Cournot.

Finally, note that the above analysis is only valid under the assumption that demand

and costs are linear.


9.4 [¤¤] Consider the following criteria for a good measure of market concentration:


1. Non-ambiguity. Given any two di®erent industries, it must be possible to rank

concentration between the two.


2. Invariance to scale. A concentration measure ought not to depend on measure
ment units.


3. Transfers. Concentration should increase when a large ¯rm's market share in
creases at the expense of a small ¯rm's market share.


4. Monotonicity. Given n identical ¯rms, concentration should be decreasing in n.


5. Cardinality. If we divide each ¯rm into k smaller ¯rms of the same size, then

concentration should decrease in the same proportion.


verify whether the indeces Cn and H satisfy these requirements.


Solution: Recall that Cm ´ [P] i [m] =1 [s][i][ and][ H][ ´][ P] i [n] =1 [s] i [2][, where][ n][ is the t][otal number of]
¯rms and m · n. [Note: there is a typo on p. 164. It should be Cm, not Cn.]
(a) We can compute both Cm and H for any two industries with the result being a

rational number. Since rational numbers form an ordered set we can rank any two industries

based on the two measures.

(b) This condition is satis¯ed since when computing the share of each ¯rm the measure

becomes units-free. For example, if we consider the share of ¯rm i as the proportion of the

¯rm's sales in the total industry sales, it is irrelevant whether we measure sales in billions

or millions or thousands of dollars.


38


(c) Let ¯rm k's market share increase at the expense of ¯rm j's, so that s [t] k [=][ s][k][ +] [®][ and]
s [t] j [=][ s][j][ ¡][ ®][, where the superscript indicates post-transfer values. Moreover, as required by]
the condition, let sk > sj.

H [t] =

We conclude that H satis¯es the transfer condition. Now suppose that j; k < m. Then we

have

i=1;i=6j;k



Cm [t] [=]



m
X si + s [t] j [+][ s][t] k [=]

We conclude that Cm does not satisfy the transfer condition.
(d) If all ¯rms are identical, then H = [1]

n [and][ C][m][ =][ m=n][. Clearly, both indeces satisfy]
the condition.

(e) It is easy to ¯nd examples where Cm violates cardinality. For example, suppose that
s1 = :4; s2 = :2. In this case, C2 = :6. Suppose all ¯rms are divided by k = 2. The new
value of C2 is :2 + :2 = :4, which is di®erent from :6=2.
We now show that H does satisfy cardinality. Let H [0] be the new value of H when each

of the initial n ¯rms is divided by k.

9.5 [¤¤] Suppose you only know the value of the market shares for the largest m

¯rms in a given industry. While you do not possess su±cient information to compute

the Her¯ndahl index, you can ¯nd a lower and an upper bound for its values. How?


Solution: A lower bound would result from an industry where, in addition to the top m

¯rms, there is a very large number of ¯rms with a very small market share. In the limit of
in¯nitesimal shares, the value of H would be H = [P] i [m] =1 [s] i [2][. An upper bound would result]
from an industry where all the remaining ¯rms have the same market share as the m-th
¯rm. The value ofremaining ¯rms would be (1 H would then be ¡ [P] i [m] =1 [s] H [i][))] = [ =s][m][P][ in number.] i [m] =1 [s] i [2] [+ (1][ ¡][ P][m] i=1 [s][i][))][ s][m][. (Notice that the]
The above lower and upper bounds are frequently very close, so a fairly good approximation if often possible.

10.1 First-time subscribers to the Economist pay a lower rate than repeat

subscribers. Is this price discrimination? Of what type?


Solution: This is an example of third-degree price discrimination. The market is segmented into new subscribers and repeat subscribers. New subscribers, know the product
less well and are thus likely to be more price sensistive. Moreover, the fact that they have
not subscribed in the past indicates that they are likely to be willing to pay less than current

subscribers. It is therefore optimal to set a lower price for new subscribers.


10.2 Many ¯rms set a price for the export market which is lower than the price

for the domestic market. How can you explain this policy?


Solution: A possible explanation is that there is a \domestic product bias" that makes

consumers less price sensitive to domestic products (see Box 10.1). It is then rational to set

higher prices in the domestic market.


10.3 Cement in Belgium is sold at a uniform delivered price throughout the

country, that is, the same price is set for each customer, including transportation

costs, regardless of where the customer is located. The same is practice is also

found in the sale of plasterboard in the United Kingdom. [2][3] Are these cases of price

discrimination?


Solution: Yes, these are cases of price discrimination. Consider the total price being paid

by each customer, P, as being composed of the price actually charged and the transportation
cost; P = pi + ti. Since locations are di®erent, transportation costs are di®erent, thus, each
consumer is charged a price pi that depends on his or her location. This is a clear example
of geographic price discrimination.


10.4 A restaurant in London has recently removed prices from its menu: each

consumer is asked to pay what he or she thinks the meal was worth. Is this a case of

price discrimination?


Solution: It is likely that each consumer will pay a price that re°ects his or her willingness

to pay. In that sense, this is a situation of close to perfect price discrimination.

10.5 In the New York Fulton ¯sh market, the average price paid for whiting by

Asian buyers is signi¯cantly lower than the price paid by White buyers. [2][4] What type

of price discrimination does this correspond to, if any? What additional information

would you need in order to answer the question?


Solution: This appears to be a case of third-degree price discrimination, whereby a group

of buyers (a market segment) pays a di®erent price than another group. Theory predicts

that in a non-competitive market (monopoly, oligopoly) buyers with higher price elasticity

should be charged a lower price; as a result, we can conclude that Asian buyers have higher

price elasticity than white buyers.

In order to have a more accurate picture, however, more information is needed. Di®erent

prices could could simply result from quantity discounts and the possible fact that di®erent

quantities are bought by the di®erent groups. It could also be the case that di®erent groups

use di®erent types of payment type (cash or credit), so that di®erent prices re°ect di®erent

costs. Also, the time of purchase (e.g., before 5am or after 5am) could be correlated with

race, so that it is not race that determines the price di®erence. The same reasoning applies

to the type of establishment does the buyer represents (store, fry shop, etc.).

For a more complete discussion, see the cited reference.


10.6 Supermarkets frequently issue coupons that entitle consumers to a dis
count in selected products. Is this a promotional strategy, or simply a form of price

discrimination? Empirical evidence suggests that paper towels are signi¯cantly more

expensive in markets o®ering coupons than in markets without coupons. [25] Is this

consistent with your interpretation?


Solution: This may be interpreted as a case of price discrimination. By o®ering coupons

(hence a lower price), supermarkets can serve the buyers with a higher price elasticity at a

di®erent price. In order for this strategy to improve revenues with respect to single price,

supermarkets should then set a higher regular price. Hence, empirical evidence is consistent

with the explanation that this is a form of price discrimination.


10.7 [¤¤] A market consists of two population segments, A and B. An individual in
segment A has demand for your product q = 50 ¡ p. An individual in segment B has

demand for your product q = 120 ¡ 2p. Segment A has 1000 people in it. Segment
B has 1200 people in it. Total cost of producing q units is C = 5000 + 20q.
(a) What is total market demand for your product?

(b) Assume that you must charge the same price to both segments. What is the

pro¯t-maximizing price? What are your pro¯ts?

(c) Imagine now that members of segment A all wear a scarlet \A" on their shirts

or blouses and that you can legally charge di®erent prices to these people. What

price do you change to the scarlet \A" people? What price do you change to those

without the scarlet \A"? What are your pro¯ts now?


Solution:


(a) Segment A people buy zero at or above p = 50. At p < 50, the total demand from segment
A types is QA = 1000(50 ¡ p) = 50000 ¡ 1000p. Segment B people buy zero at or above
p = 60. At p < 60, the total demand from segment B types is QB = 1200(120 ¡ 2p) =
144000 ¡ 2400p. At p ¸ 60, quantity demanded is zero. At 50 < P < 60, total demand is
just the demand from B, Q = 144000 ¡ 2400p. At P < 50 total demand is from both types
Q = (144000 ¡ 2400p) + (50000 ¡ 1000p) = 194000 ¡ 3400p.


(b) First note that MC = 20 at all output levels. For p > 50, the only consumers in the market
are segment B consumers so TR = Q(60 ¡ Q=2400) = 60Q ¡ Q2=2400. Using calculus, one
can then take the derivative and ¯nd MR = 60 ¡ Q=1200 in this range. But note that at
the break point p = 50, where segment A customer begin to enter the market, Q = 24000,
and MR = 40, which is still greater than MC . Therefore, the ¯rm would keep lowering its
price to sell more units. This would induce segment A consumers to buy so the demand
function should we consider at p < 50, is now a combination of A and B segment customers
so TR = 57:06Q ¡ Q2=3400; MR = 57:06 ¡ Q=1700. Taking the derivative of this total
revenue function and setting it equal to MC we have 57:06 ¡ Q=1700 = 20 which yields
an optimal output of Q = 63002, which yields p = 38:53. To avoid doing the calculus, one
could set up a spreadsheet with every possible quantity and ¯nd the pro¯t maximizing Q.


(c) The problem can now be solve as two separate markets. In each, you pick the pro¯t maximizing quantity to sell to the segment by setting marginal cost equal to the marginal revenue
for that segement..

10.8 [¤] Coca-Cola recently announced that it is developing a \smart" vending

machine. Such machines are able to change prices according to the outside temperature. [2][6]


26Financial Times, October 28, 1999.


42


Suppose for the purposes of this problem that the temperature can be either
\High" or \Low." On days of \High" temperature, demand is given by Q = 280 ¡ 2p,
where Q is number of cans of Coke sold during the day and p is the price per can
measured in cents. On days of \Low" temperature, demand is only Q = 160 ¡ 2p.
There is an equal number days with \High" and \Low" temperature. The marginal

cost of a can of Coke is 20 cents.

(a) Suppose that Coca-Cola indeed installs a \smart" vending machine, and thus

is able to charge di®erent prices for Coke on \Hot" and \Cold" days. What price

should Coca-Cola charge on a \Hot" day? What price should Coca-Cola charge on a

\Cold" day?

(b) Alternatively, suppose that Coca-Cola continues to use its normal vending

machines, which must be programmed with a ¯xed price, independent of the weather.

Assuming that Coca-Cola is risk neutral, what is the optimal price for a can of Coke?

(c) What are Coca-Cola's pro¯ts under constant and weather-variable prices?

How much would Coca-Cola be willing to pay to enable its vending machine to vary

prices with the weather, i.e., to have a \smart" vending machine?


Solution:


(a) On a Hot day, Q = 280 ¡ 2p, or p = 140 ¡ Q=2. Marginal revenue is MR = 140 ¡ Q.
Equating to marginal cost (20) and solving, we get Q [¤] = 120 and p [¤] = 80. On a Cold day,
Q = 160 ¡ 2p, or p = 80 ¡ Q=2. Marginal revenue is MR = 80 ¡ Q. Equating to marginal
cost (20) and solving, we get Q [¤] = 60 and p¤ = 50.

[(b)] Observe from part (a) that even on a Hot day the optimal price is no greater than

80 cents. So, we can restrict our attention to prices of 80 cents or less. In this price range,

the expected demand is given by Q = :5(280 ¡ 2p) + :5(160 ¡ 2p) = 220 ¡ 2p. Solving for p
gives p = 110 ¡ Q=2. The marginal revenue associated with this expected demand curve is
given by MR = 110 ¡ Q. Equating this marginal revenue to marginal cost, we get Q [¤] = 90
and p [¤] = 65.

[(c)] Under price discrimination, from part (a), pro¯ts on a Hot day are (80 ¡ 20)120 =

$72, and pro¯ts on a Cold day are (50 ¡ 20)60 = $18. Expected pro¯ts per day are therefore
($72 + $18)=2 = $45. Under uniform pricing, expected pro¯ts per day are (65 ¡ 20)90 =
$40:50. It follows that Coca-Cola should be willing to pay up to an extra $4.50 per day for
a \smart" vending machine.


10.9 [¤] Suppose the California Memorial Stadium has a capacity of 50,000 and

is used for exactly seven football games a year. Three of these are OK games, with
a demand for tickets given by D = 150; 000 ¡ 3p per game, where p is ticket price.
(For simplicity, assume there is only one type of ticket.) Three of the season games
are not so important, the demand being D = 90; 000 ¡ 3p per game. Finally, one of
the games is really big, the demand being D = 240; 000 ¡ 3p. The costs of operating
the Stadium are essentially independent of the number of tickets sold.


43


(a) Determine the optimal ticket price for each game, assuming the objective of

pro¯t maximization.

Given that the Stadium is frequently full, the idea of expanding the Stadium has

arisen. A preliminary study suggests that the cost of capacity expansion would be

$100 per seat per year.

(b) Would you recommend that the University of California go ahead with the

project of capacity expansion?


Solution:


(a) Demand for OK games is given by D = 150 ¡ 3p, where number of tickets is measured in

thousands. Inverse demand is p = 50 ¡ Q=3. Marginal revenue is MR = 50 ¡ 2=3 ¤ Q.

Marginal cost is zero, since costs do not depend on the number of tickets sold. Equating

marginal cost to marginal revenue, we get Q = 75. This is greater than capacity. Therefore,

the optimal solution is simply to set price such that demand equals capacity: 150 ¡ 3p = 50,

which implies p = $33:3

Demand for not-so-important games is given by D = 90 ¡ 3p. Inverse demand is p =

30 ¡ Q=3. Marginal revenue is MR = 50 ¡ 2=3 ¢ Q. Equating marginal revenue to marginal

cost, we get Q = 45. Substituting back in the inverse demand curve we get p = $15.

Since demand for the Big Game is greater than for the OK games, it will surely be the

case that MR = MC implies a demand level greater than capacity. The optimal price is

therefore determined by equating demand to capacity: 240 ¡ 3p = 50, or simply p = $63:3


(b) The marginal revenue of an additional seat is the sum of the di®erence between marginal

revenue and marginal cost for all games where capacity was a constraint. For OK games,

marginal revenue is given by MR = 50 ¡ 2=3 ¢ 50 = 16:7. For the Big Game, MR =

80 ¡ 2=3 ¢ 50 = 46:7. Adding these up (three times the ¯rst plus the second) we get $96.7.

Since this is less than the marginal cost of capacity exapansion, it is not worth it to pursue

the project.


10.10 [¤¤] Your software company has just completed the ¯rst version of Spoken
Word, a voice-activated word processor. As marketing manager, you have to decide

on the pricing of the new software. You commissioned a study to determine the

potential demand for SpokenWord. From this study, you know that there are es
sentially two market segments of equal size, professionals and students (one million

each). Professionals would be willing to pay up to $400 and students up to $100 for

the full version of the software. A substantially scaled-down version of the software

would be worth $50 to consumers and worthless to professionals. It is equally costly

to sell any version. In fact, other than the initial development costs, production costs

are zero.

(a) What are the optimal prices for each version of the software?

Suppose that, instead of the scaled-down version, the ¯rm sells an intermediate

version that is valued at $200 by professionals and $75 by students.


44


(b) What are the optimal prices for each version of the software? Is the ¯rm

better o® by selling the intermediate version instead of the scaled-down version?

Suppose that professionals are willing to pay up to $800(a ¡ :5), and students

up to $100a, for a given version of the software, where a is the software's degree

of functionality: a = 1 denotes a fully functional version, whereas a value a < 1

means that only 100a% features of the software are functional. It is equally costly to

produce any level of a. In fact, other than the initial development costs, production

costs are zero.

(c) How many versions of the software should the ¯rm sell? Which versions?

What are the optimal prices of each version?


Solution:


(a) It is optimal to price the full version at 400 and the scaled-down version at 50. Total pro¯ts

are 450.


(b) One ¯rst possibility would be to price the intermediate version at 75 and the full version

at 400. However, this would lead professionals to choose the intermediate version since

the di®erence between willingness to pay and price is greater for the intermediate version.

In order to induce professionals to by the full version, the full version's price would need

to be 75+(400-200)=275, where the value in parentheses is the professionals' di®erence

in willingness to pay between the two versions. This would lead to a total pro¯t of 275

+ 75=350, which is lower than initially. Still another possibility would be to price the

full version at 400 and the intermediate version at 400 - (400-200) = 200. In this case,

professionals would buy the full version but students would not buy the intermediate version.

Pro¯ts would then be 400: better than 350 but still less than the 450 the ¯rm would get

with the truly scaled-down version.


(c) There are two candidates for optimal price: $400 and $100. Pro¯ts are given by $400m in

the ¯rst case and $200m in the second case (recall that there are one million professionals

and one million students). It follows that a = 1; p = 400 is the optimal solution.

Since there are only two types of consumers, it will not be necessary to o®er more than

two di®erent versions. Since it is equally costly to produce any version and willingness to

pay is increasing in a, it follows that one of the versions should have have full functionality

(a = 1), the other one a · 1. Since professionals value at zero any version with a · :5, we
conclude that the \damaged" version has :5 · a · 1.

At the margin, professionals are willing to pay more for greater functionality than stu
dents. Therefore, if there is to be self-selection between two di®erent versions, it will be the

case that professionals choose the fully functional version and students the other one. If pro
fessionals prefer the fully functional version, it must be that p1¡pa · 800(1¡:5)¡800(a¡:5),
that is, the price di®erence must be smaller than the di®erence in willingness to pay (p1 and
pa are the prices of the fully functional and damaged versions, respectively). Moreover, it
must be p1 · 400. By the same token, if students prefer to purchase the \damaged" version,
it must be that p1 ¡ pa ¸ 100 ¡ 100a and pa · 100a.


45


Suppose the ¯rst and fourth inequalities are binding. Pro¯ts as a function of a are then

given by p1 + pa, which is equal to 200a + 800(1 ¡ :5) ¡ 800(a ¡ :5). This is decreasing
in a, implying that the optimal value would be a = :5. But this would lead to p1 = 450,

which violates the second inequality. It follows that the optimal solution is to choose the

minimum value of a such that the second constraint is just satis¯ed, that is, 100a + 800(1 ¡
:5) ¡ 800(a ¡ :5) = 400, or simply a = 4=7. (Notice that the third constraint is satis¯ed for
these values.) Optimal prices are therefore given by p1 = 400 and pa = 100(4=7) ¼ 57:14.
Pro¯ts under one version are $400m. Under two versions, the ¯rm gets $457.14m, an

increase of $57.14m. Basically, the increase corresponds to student sales.


10.11 [¤] One of the arguments used in Microsoft's defense against allegations

of monopoly behavior is that it \cannot charge a monopoly price because it faces

competition from . . . its own installed base." Based on the above discussion on

durable goods, how would you qualify/extend Microsoft's defense?


Solution: In Section 10.4, we discussed the problem faced by a monopolist selling a

durable good. If the monopolist can set di®erent prices over time (inter-temporal price

discrimination), then its pro¯ts may be lower that they would be if the monopolist could not

set di®erent prices over time. Rational buyers know that, once high-valuation buyers have

purchased the good the seller has an incentive to lower price and capture lower-valuation

consumers who would otherwise not purchase the product.

In order for this to take place, it is important that potential buyers have some °exibility

regarding the time of purchase (as is usual with durable goods). Operating systems seem

a good candidate for this: typically, consumers are already using a give operating system

when they buy a new one, and thus delay is a reasonable option. However, many computer

purchases are bundled with the latest operating system, in which case buyers don't really

make a decision of when to purchase the operating system. In summary, it's unclear how

important the durable-good constraint is in this case.


10.12 In 1998, the European Commission ¯ned Volkswagen more than $100m

for preventing its dealers in Italy from selling to foreign buyers. Is this consistent

with the European Commission's policy regarding price discrimination? Is this the

right decision from a social welfare point of view?


Solution: Section 10.5 presents several cases concerning the European Union's policy

towards price discrimination. The E.U. appears concerned with price discrimination within

the union but less so between the E.U. and the rest of the world. Since both Italy and

Germany (home to Volkswagen) are part of the E.U., the decision is consistent with the

E.U. policy goal of creating a single market.


46


From a social welfare point of view, as Section 10.5 suggests, things are not straight
forward. Price discrimination may be more e±cient if total welfare is increased. However,

price discrimination may be considered unfair by consumers: German buyers may not like

the idea of paying more for the same car as Italian buyers.


10.13 [¤] Can coupons be used to price discriminate? How? Empirical evidence

suggests that, in U.S. cities where coupons are used more often, breakfast cereals are

sold at a lower price. [2][7] Is this consistent with the interpretation that coupons are

used for price discrimination? If not, how can the empirical observation be explained?


Solution: Paralleling the explanation in Exercise 10.6, one could argue that coupons can

be used for price discrimination. However, the empirical evidence from the breakfast cereal

market is not consistent with this explanation (as was the example with the market for

paper towels in Exercise 10.6). The interpretation of coupons as a promotion strategy is

probably a better explanation.

For more information, see the cited reference.


10.14 [¤¤] In September 1997, the New York state's attorney general pressed

charges against Procter & Gamble over the fact that P&G eliminated the use of

coupons. The argument was that P&G was colluding with rivals to eliminate coupons,

for doing so \only works if everybody goes along with it." [28] What does this suggest

about the practice of price discrimination in the context of oligopoly? (In the end,

P&G, while not admitting any wrongdoing, agreed on a $4.2m settlement of the

charges.)


Solution: Price discrimination may be viewed as a \prisoners' Dilemma:" If oligopolists

can commit not to use coupons (and price discriminate) then everybody is better o® (as are

both prisoners in the case they do not defect). However, using coupons may be a dominant

strategy, implying that every player would use it. The equilibrium where no player uses

coupons can then only be achieved through collusion / cooperation.


10.15 [¤] Suppose that perfect price discrimination implies a transaction cost T,

incurred by the seller. Show that perfect price discrimination may be optimal for the

seller but welfare decreasing for society as a whole.

47


Solution: Refer to Figure 10.1. By going from no price discrimination to (perfect) price

discrimination, the seller's gross pro¯ts increase by B + C, whereas consumer surplus de
creases by B. The net social gain is C. Suppose however that the seller must incur a cost

T in order to implement perfect price discrimation. If C < T < B + C, then perfect price

discrimination is pro¯table but not socially desirable.


10.16 [¤] Consider the model of a monopolist with two markets presented in Section

??. Suppose that the seller has a limited capacity and zero marginal cost up to

capacity (or very low marginal cost). An example of this would be an airline with

two types of passengers or a football stadium with two types of attendees.

Derive the conditions for optimal pricing. How do they relate to the case when

there are no capacity constraints?


Solution: Let K denote capacity and p1(q1), p2(q2) denote the inverse demand functions.

The monopolist's problem becomes:


max
q1;q2 [q][1][p][1][(][q][1][) +][ q][2][p][2][(][q][2][)][ ¡][ c][(][q][1][ +][ q][2][)]


subject to

q1 + q2 · K:


The Lagrangean for this problem is


L = q1p1(q1) + q2p2(q2) ¡ c(q1 + q2) + ¸ K ¡ q1 ¡ q2 :
³ ´


The ¯rst-order conditions are:


MR1 = MC + ¸


MR2 = MC + ¸;


or simply


MR1 = ¸


MR2 = ¸;


since marginal cost is zero up to capacity. Depending on whether capacity constraints are

binding or not, we will have ¸ positive or zero. Whichever is the case, the above equations

show that optimality implies that marginal revenue be equated across markets. Notice that,

if demand elasticity di®ers across markets, then this implies di®erent prices for the di®erent

markets.

The same result can be obtained intuitively. Suppose that the seller is capacity con
strained. Is the current set of prices optimal? One alternative is to take one unit from one


48


market and sell it the other market, changing prices accordingly. Whould the seller want to

do this? By taking one unit away from Market 1, the seller would lose MR 1. By selling it
in Market 2, the seller would get MR 2. Optimality then requires that MR 1 = MR 2.



10.17 [¤¤¤] Consider the model of non-linear pricing introduced in Section ??.

Suppose there are two types of consumers, in equal number. Type 1 have demand

D1(p) = 1 ¡ p, and type 2 D2(p) = 2(1 ¡ p). Marginal cost is zero.
(a) Show that if the seller is precluded from using non-linear pricing, then the
optimal price is p = [1] [3]

2 [and pro¯t (per consumer)] 8 [.]

(b) Show that if the seller must set a single two-part tari®, then the optimal
values are f = 329 [and][ p][ =] [1] 4 [, for a pro¯t of] 169 [.]




[1] [3]

2 [and pro¯t (per consumer)] 8



values are f = 329 [and][ p][ =] [1] 4 [, for a pro¯t of] 169 [.]

(c) Show that if the seller can set multiple two-part tari®s, then the optimal values
are f1 = [1] 8 [,][ p][1][ =] [1] 2 [,][ f][2][ =] [7] 8 [,][ p][2][ = 0, for a pro¯t of] [5] 8 [.]

d) Show that, like pro¯ts, total surplus increases from (a) to (b) and from (b) to

(c).




[1] 8 [,][ p][1][ =] [1] 2




[1] 2 [,][ f][2][ =] [7] 8




[7] 8 [,][ p][2][ = 0, for a pro¯t of] [5] 8



Solution: (a) Total demand from a consumer of Type 1 and a consumer of Type 2 is given
by D(p) = D1(p) + D2(p) = 1 ¡ p + 2(1 ¡ p) = 3(1 ¡ p). The monopolist's problem is:


max 3p(1 ¡ p) (7)
p


The solution to this problem is given by the ¯rst order condition, 1 ¡ 2p = 0, so that we
get p = [1] 2 [and the pro¯t is] [3] 4 [. Social welfare is given by the sum of the ¯rm's pro¯t and the]

consumer surplus and is equal to: Wa = 3p(1 ¡ p) + (1 ¡ p) [2] = 1.
(b) In this case the monopolist's demand is the same. However, the monopolist now can
also charge a ¯xed fee, f, from both consumers. The problem becomes:


max 3p(1 ¡ p) + 2f
p



s.t. [(1][ ¡][ p][)][2] ¸ f;

2

where the constraint comes from the fact that the consumer of Type 1 must have a positive
surplus, otherwise it will not buy. Once the constraint for the Type 1 consumer is satis¯ed,
the constraint for Type 2 is also satis¯ed; we can therefore ignore it. The monopolist is
better o® when it extracts as much surplus as possible from consumers. Thus, its optimal
policy requires that the ¯xed fee be equal to the Type 1 consumer surplus, that is, the
constraint should be binding. The monopolist's problem becomes:


max 3p(1 ¡ p) + (1 ¡ p) [2] ;
p


and the solution is given by the ¯rst order condition, 3 ¡ 6p ¡ 2 + 2p = 0, so that we get
p45 = [1] 4 [,][ f][ =] 329 [and the pro¯t is] [9] 8 [. Welfare is given by][ W][b][ = 3][p][(1][¡][p][)+(1][¡][p][)][2] [+0+][ (1][¡] 2 [p][)][2] =

(c) In this case the monopolist's problem is more complex:


max p1(1 ¡ p1) + f1 + 2p2(1 ¡ p2) + f2
p1;p2


s:t: CS1(p1) ¸ f1 (PC1)


CS2(p2) ¸ f2 (PC2)


CS1(p2) ¡ f2 · CS1(p1) ¡ f1 (IC1)


CS2(p1) ¡ f1 · CS2(p2) ¡ f2; (IC2)


where the participation constraints assure that the consumer will prefer to consume and the
incentive compatibility constraints assure that each plan is chosen by the targeted type of
consumers, that is, Type 1 consumers will prefer plan 1 to plan 2 while Type 2 consumers
will prefer plan 2 to plan 1.
One can show that PC1 and IC2 are binding, while PC2 and IC1 are not. Suppose that
PC1 and IC2 are satis¯ed. We have: CS2(p2) ¡ f2 ¸ CS2(p1) ¡ f1 ¸ CS2(p1) ¡ CS1(p1) ¸
0, where the last inequality comes from the fact that, at any price, the surplus of the
Type 2 consumers is higher, since they consume more. Therefore, PC2 is automatically
satis¯ed. PC2 will not be binding unless consumers of Type 1 are not served. To see this,
suppose PC2 is binding. From IC2 and PC1 we get CS2(p1) · f1 · CS1(p1) which is
obviously impossible. In contrast, PC1 must be binding: if PC1 and PC2 would not bind
the monopolist could increase its pro¯ts by increasing both f1 and f2 with the same small
amount without violating the ICs. If IC2 is not binding the monopolist could increase f2
with a small amount and keep all other constraints satis¯ed, while increasing her pro¯ts.
Therefore, we have f1 = CS1(p1) = (1¡2p1) [2] and f2 = CS2(p2) ¡ CS2(p1) + f1 =

(1 ¡ p2) [2] ¡ [(1][¡] 2 [p][1][)][2] . The monopolist's problem becomes:


max p1(1 ¡ p1) + 2p2(1 ¡ p2) + (1 ¡ p2) [2]
p1;p2



The ¯rst order conditions are: 1 ¡ 2p1 = 0 and 2 ¡ 4p2 ¡ 2 + 2p2 = 0, and the solutions
are: p1 = [1] 2 [,][ f][1][ =] [1] 8 [,][ p][2][ = 0,][ f][2][ =] [7] 8 [and the pro¯t is] [5] 4 [. The welfare is given by][ W][c][ =]




[1] [1]

¡ p1) + [¡] 2 [1] + 2p2(1 ¡ p2) + (1 ¡ p2) = 8 [< W][b][.]

(d) The proof is already contained in the previous points.



10.18 [¤¤¤] Many retail stores set lower-than-usual prices during a fraction of the

time (sale). One interpretation of this practice is that it allows for price discrimination

between patient and impatient buyers.

Suppose that each buyer wants to purchase one unit per period. Each period is

divided into two subperiods, the ¯rst and the second part of the period. Suppose

there are two types of buyers, i = 1; 2. Each type of buyer is subdivided according to
