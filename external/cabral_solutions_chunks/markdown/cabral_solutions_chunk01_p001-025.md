# Solutions to Exercises From \Introduction to Industrial Organization"

## Lu¶³s Cabral [1] November 14, 2001

1.1 [¤] Empirical evidence from a sample of more than 600 U.K. ¯rms indicates

that, controlling for the quantity of inputs (that is, taking into account the quantity

of inputs), ¯rm output is increasing in the number of competitors and decreasing in

market share and industry concentration. [2] How do these results relate to the ideas

presented in the chapter?


Solution: In Section 1.2, we argued that one of the implications of market power is the

decline of productive e±ciency. Controlling for input levels, the level of output is a measure

of productive e±ciency. The number of competitors and the degree of concentration are

measures of the degree of competition (concentration is an inverse indicator). The empirical

evidence from U.K. ¯rms is therefore consistent with the view presented in the text.

As to the third explanatory variable (market share), see the discussion in Chapter 9.


2.1 \A price-taking ¯rm selling in a market with a price greater than the ¯rm's

average cost should increase its output level." Comment.


Solution: In a competitive market, ¯rms are price takers; optimal output is such that price

equals marginal cost (or marginal revenue equals marginal cost). It is perfectly possible that

price be equal to marginal cost and greater than average cost. In fact, if price is greater

than the minimum of average cost, then the optimal output is such that price is greater

than average cost. In summary, the sentence is wrong.

2.2 [¤] Consider the following values of the price elasticity of demand:


Cigarettes 0.5

zinha U.S. luxury cars in U.S. 1.9

Foreign luxury cars in U.S. 2.8


Based on these values, provide an estimate of the impact on revenues of a 10%

increase in the price of each of the above three products.


Solution: Revenue is given by

R = PQ


Taking the derivative with respect to P and rearranging, we get


d R
= Q + P [d Q]
d P d P


d Q

= Q + Q [P]

Q d P

= Q(1 ¡ ²);


where

P

² ´ ¡ [d Q]

d P Q


is the price elasticity of demand (see page 17). It follows that a 10% increase in price
implies an increase in revenues from cigarette sales given by 10(1 ¡ :5) = 5%. In the case of
U.S. luxury cars and foreign luxury cars, a 10% price increase would lead to a decrease in
revenues of -9% and -18%, respectively.


2.3 You own and operate a facility located in Taiwan that manufactures 64
megabit dynamic random-access memory chips (DRAMs) for personal computers

(PCs). One year ago you acquired the land for this facility for $2 million, and used

$3million of your own money to ¯nance the plant and equipment needed for DRAM

manufacturing. Your facility has a maximum capacity of 10 million chips per year.

Your cost of funds is 10% per year for either borrowing and investing. You could

sell the land, plant and equipment today for $8 million; you estimate that the land,

plant, and equipment will gain 6% in value over the coming year. (Use a one-year

planning horizon for this problem.)

In addition to the cost of land, plant, and equipment, you incur various operating

expenses associated with DRAM production, such as energy, labor, raw materials,

and packaging. Experience shows that these costs are $4 per chip, regardless of the

number of chips produced during the year. In addition, producing DRAMs will cause

you to incur ¯xed costs of $500,000 per year for items such as security, legal, and

utilities.


2


(a) What is your cost function, C(q), where q is the number of chips produced

during the year?

Assume now that you can sell as many chips as you make at the going market

price per chip of p.

(b) What is the minimum price, p, at which you would ¯nd it pro¯table to produce

DRAMs during the coming year?


Solution:


(a) The $5 million you originally spent for the land, plant, and equipment is a sunk expenditure
and thus not an economic cost. However, there is a \user cost of capital" associated with
the land, plant and equipment, based on its current market value of $8 million and your cost
of funds and the rate of depreciation or appreciation of the asset over the planning horizon.
Your (opportunity) cost of investing $8 million for one year is $800,000, but these assets will
appreciate by $480,000 over the year, giving a (net) user cost of capital of $320,000. (The
depreciation rate is 6%.) This is a ¯xed cost of making DRAM's, to which we must add
the other ¯xed costs of $500,000 to get a combined ¯xed cost of $820,000 for the year. The
variable costs are a constant $4 per chip, so the cost function is C(Q) = 820; 000 + 4Q, in
the range of 0 < Q < 10; 000; 000. (One could also report that C(0) = 0, by de¯nition, and
that C(Q) is in¯nite for Q > 10; 000; 000, since your maximum capacity is ten million chips
per year. Of course, in practice there would likely be a way to push production beyond
\rated capacity," at some cost penalty, but that is beyond the scope of this problem.)


(b) The average cost function is AC (Q) = 820; 000=Q + 4, again up to ten million chips per
year. This declines with Q, so the minimum AC is achieved at full capacity utilization.
At ten million chips per year, the ¯xed costs come to $0.082 per chip, so average costs are
$4.082 per chip. This is your minimum average cost, and thus the minimum price at which
is makes sense to stay open for the year.


2.4 Consider the following 1988 data on the costs of a Sprinter (Class 150/2)
train: [3]


Capital cost 525,000

Annual costs (per unit)

Depreciation (20 years) 26,300

Overhaul and maintenance 32,600

Stabling and cleaning 9,400

Total annual cost of

2 drivers 20,200

2 guards 15,600

Mileage costs of rolling stock (per unit mile)

Maintenance 0.15

Fuel 0.126


3Source: Data provided by British Rail to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission.

(Notes: (a) Annual costs assume a 90,000 mile benchmark annual use. (b) There are

145 seats on the train.)


Based on these numbers, answer the following questions:

(a) What is the average cost per train mile?

(b) What is the average cost per passenger mile? (Note: the average number of

passengers during this time period was 45.)

(c) What is the marginal cost per train mile?

(d) What is the marginal cost per passenger mile?


Solution:


(a) Fixed costs are 26,300+32,600+9,400+20,200+15,600=104,100. (Note: the capital cost
should not be included in the yearly cost, only its depreciation.) Average variable cost per
train mile is constant at .15+.126=.276 per train mile. It follows that average cost per
train mile is 104,100/m+.276, where m is the number of miles. Using the benchmark of
90,000 miles, this comes down to 1.157+.276=1.433. As these number suggests, this is a
capital-intensive, strong-scale-economies technology.


(b) 1.433/45=.032 (approximately).


(c) Average variable cost per train mile is constant(see part a), thus equal to marginal cost:
.126


(d) .276/45= .0061 (approximately).


2.5 You are considering opening your own restaurant. To do so, you will have

to quit your current job, which pays $46k per year, and cash in your life savings

of $200k, which have been in a certi¯cate of deposit paying 6% per year. You will

need this $200k to purchase equipment for your restaurant operations. You estimate

that you will have to spend $4k during the year to maintain the equipment so as

to preserve its market value at $200k. Fortunately, you own a building suitable for

the restaurant. You currently rent out this building on a month-by-month basis for

$2500 per month. You anticipate that you will spend $50k for food, $40k for extra

help, and $14k for utilities and supplies during the ¯rst year of operations. There are

no other costs involved in this business.

What are the economic costs of operating the restaurant during the ¯rst year? In

other words, what level of revenues will you need to achieve in the ¯rst year to make

the ¯rst year pro¯table in an economic sense?


Solution: There are three opportunity costs:


1. The salary you could earn if you do not quit: $46k.

2. The interest income your savings could earn if you do not cash in: $200k £0:06 = $12k.


4


3. The rent your building could earn if you do not use it for your restaurant: $2:5k £
12months = $30k.


There are four direct costs:

1. Maintaining the equipment: $4k.

2. Food: $50k.
3. Hiring extra help: $40k.

4. Utilities and supplies: $14k.


Note that the $200k cost of the equipment is not an economic cost because it is essentially

reversible. That is, you can always sell the equipment for its current market value as long

as you maintain it. Only the interest you would have earned on the money tied up in the

equipment and the cost to maintain it are economic costs.

Adding up opportunity and direct costs yields $196k. This is the break-even revenue for

¯rst year of operations.


2.6 Eurotunnel, the company that owns the tunnel linking England and France,

earned an operating pro¯t of $46 million during the ¯rst semester of 1998. How
ever, subtracting interest payments (mainly from the construction of the tunnel), its

bottom line was a loss of $130 during the same period. [4] Is it optimal to continue

operating the tunnel, given all these losses?


Solution: The interest payments correspond to a cost (building the tunnel) that is sunk

(literally!). It should therefore not be taken into consideration in the decision of whether

or not to continue operations. However, if bankruptcy is a viable option for the owners of

Eurotunnel, and if the situation is expected to remain the same (operating pro¯t less than

interest payments), then the optimal option is to declare bankruptcy.


2.7 [¤] 1998 was a turning point for Old McDonald's farm. Until then, the farm

produced unprocessed tomato exclusively, selling its 100,000t for a pro¯t margin of

$2.1/t. In January 1998, however, Old McDonald decided to start exporting processed

tomato (tomato pulp) to Europe. At that time, the price of tomato pulp was $6/t. In

order to produce tomato pulp, Old McDonald bought a machine capable of processing

100,000t per year. The machine cost $200,000 and was paid for with retained earnings

that had been earning an 8% rate of return. This machine has a useful lifetime of

2 years. The market value of this machine drops to $50,000 after one year of use

(and zero after two years of use). In addition to the machine cost, there is a $2.2/t

harvesting and processing cost (mostly labor cost).

(a) Determine Old McDonald's average cost, marginal cost, and pro¯t margin.


4The Wall Street Journal Europe, September 22, 1998.


5


A few months later, things turned bad for Old McDonald. In December 1998, the

European Union increased its tari®s on imported tomato pulp, implying that the net

price received by American exporters is now only $5/t. It is not expected that this

price will change in the future. One accountant consulting for Old McDonald stated

that as margins have declined drastically the farmer had better sell the machine right

away and go back to producing unprocessed tomato. Old McDonald is trying to

decide whether to take this consultant's advice.

(b) What would you advise Old McDonald to do?

(c) Would your advice change if the price of unprocessed tomato were expected

to be $0.50/t higher than described above? Explain why or why not.


Solution:


(a) The user cost of capital corresponding to the machine is given by 8% times $200,000 plus

(200; 000 ¡ 50; 000), or simply $166,000. Divided by 100,000t this gives $1.66/t. Adding
labor costs of $2.2/t, this gives a total of $3.86/t, the average cost. Marginal cost is $2.2/t

up to 100,000t/year, in¯nity thereafter. The pro¯t margin is therefore $6-$2.2=$3.8/t (up

to 100,000t).


(b) We are considering the option of continuing to produce tomato pulp versus the option of

producing unprocessed tomato. There are two opportunity costs that need to be accounted

for. First, by selling tomato pulp the farmer is foregoing the chance of selling unprocessed

tomato. This opportunity cost amounts to the the margin on unprocessed tomato, or $2.1/t.

The second opportunity cost is that of the machine | the user cost of capital. Since the

machine is now worth only $50,000 and will last for one more year, the user cost of capital

is given by 50,000 plus 8% times 50,000 plus, or $54,000, which corresponds to $.54/t. The

average economic pro¯t, that is, including all imputed costs is, $5 (price) - 2.2 (labor) - .54

(cost of capital) - 2.1 (margin on unprocessed tomato) = $.16. Since this is positive, the

¯rm should continue operating the machine and sell tomato pulp.


(c) By a calculation analogous to the one above, we conclude that the farmer is better o® by

switching to unprocessed tomato.


2.8 [¤] Las-O-Vision is the sole producer of holographic TVs, 3DTVs. The daily

demand for 3DTVs is D(p) = 10200 ¡ 100p. The cost of producing q 3DTVs per day
is q [2] =2 (note this implies that MC = q).

(a) What is Las-O-Vision's total revenue schedule?

(b) What is Las-O-Vision's marginal revenue schedule?

(c) What is the pro¯t-maximizing number of 3DTVs for Las-O-Vision to produce

each day? What price does Las-O-Vision charge per 3DTV? What is its daily pro¯t?


Solution:


6


(a) Total Revenue is given by p(x) ¢ x, that is, the revenue that Las-O-Vision receives when it
sells x units. To get p(x), we invert the demand function x = 10; 200 ¡ 100p by solving for
p in terms of x, or p(x) = 102 ¡ x=100. Substituting this into our total revenue equation,
we obtain TR (x) = (102 ¡ x=100) ¢ x = 102x ¡ x [2] =100.


(b) Marginal revenue is the derivative of Total Revenue with respect to x, so MR (x) = 102 ¡
x=50; or, since our demand equation is linear in x, we can obtain it by recalling that the
marginal revenue curve is twice as steep as the inverse demand curve and starts at the same

point on the vertical axis.


(c) The pro¯t maximizing quantity, x [¤] is that quantity at which marginal cost and marginal
revenue are equal. Setting MR (x) = MC, we have 102 ¡ x [¤] =50 = x [¤], or x [¤] = 100. The
pro¯t maximizing prices is that which generates x [¤] = 100 in sales or, substituting into the
inverse demand function calculated in (a), p(100) = 102 ¡ (100=100) = 101. When selling
100 units, Las-O-Vision generates Total revenues equal to TR (100) = 102¢100¡1002=100 =
$10; 100. Its total cost is 1002/2=5000. Therefore its total pro¯t when it sells 100 units is
10; 100 ¡ 5000 = $5; 100.


2.9 [¤] You own a private parking lot near U.C. Berkeley with a capacity of 600
cars. The demand for parking at this lot is estimated to be Q = 1000¡ 2p, where Q is
the number of customers with monthly parking passes and p is the monthly parking
fee per car.

(a) Derive your marginal revenue schedule.

(b) What price generates the greatest revenues?

Your ¯xed costs of operating the parking lot, such as the monthly lease paid to

the landlord and the cost of hiring an attendant, are $25,000 per month. In addition,

your insurance company charges you $20 per car per month for liability coverage,

and the City of Berkeley charges you $30 per car per month as part of its policy to

discourage the use of private automobiles.

(c) What is your pro¯t-maximizing price?


Solution:


¡
(a) Solving for p gives p = 500 Q=2. Using the \twice-the-slope" formula for marginal revenue
associated with a linear demand curve, we then have MR = 500 ¡ Q.
Alternatively, one could directly write down the revenue function, R(Q) = p(Q) ¤ Q, and
plus in for p(Q) = 500¡Q=2 to get R(Q) = (500¡Q=2)Q = 500Q¡Q2=2, then di®erentiate
with respect to Q to get MR (Q) = 500 ¡ Q.


(b) Revenues are maximized when marginal revenues equal zero. Setting MR = 0 gives 500 ¡
Q = 0, or Q = 500. Then solving for price using the demand curve gives p = 250.


(c) The (monthly) cost function here is C(Q) = 25; 000 + 50Q. Marginal cost per car is simply
$50. Setting MR = MC gives 500 ¡ Q = 50, or Q [¤] = 450. Using the demand curve to solve
for the price that goes along with this quantity gives p [¤] = $275.


7


To con¯rm that this is indeed the pro¯t-maximizing price, you also should check that

it is not optimal to shut down, i.e., that your economic pro¯ts are positive in comparison

with shutting down. This can be done by directly calculating pro¯ts, which are given by
¼ [¤] = p [¤] Q [¤] ¡ C(Q [¤] ) = $275(450) ¡ $50(450) ¡ $25; 000 = $76; 250. Another way to check
pro¯tability is to calculate the \contribution to ¯xed costs" generated by your customers.

This contribution is $225 per customer times 450 customers, or $101,250, which easily

exceeds the ¯xed costs of $25,000 per month.


2.10 [¤¤¤] You are one of two companies bidding to try to win a large construction

project. Call your bid B. You estimate that your costs of actually performing the

work required will be $800k. You are risk neutral. [5] You will win if and only if your

bid is lower than that of the other bidder. You are not sure what bid your rival will

submit, but you estimate that the rival's bid is uniformly distributed between $1m

and $2m. [6] What bid should you submit?


Solution: A risk-neutral bidder will use a bidding strategy that maximizes the expected

value of its bid B. This entails picking a bid value B that balances two o®setting e®ects|

changes in the value of winning due to changes in the bid (the larger your bid is the more

valuable the contract is) and changes in the chances of winning due to changes in B (the

larger your bid is the less likely you are to win). Formally, the expected value of a bid B

can be expressed E[B] = (B ¡ 800; 000) ¢ Prob(B < Br), in which Br is the rival bidder's

bid and Prob(B < Br) is the probability that its bid, B, is less than its rival's bid. The

¯rst term in this equation is simply the payo® when a bidder wins. The second term is its

chances of winning (which requires that B < Br).

In this problem, the focal bidder believes that its rival's bid can be anywhere between

$1m and $2m so Prob(B < Br) = 1 ¡ (B ¡ 1; 000; 000)=1; 000; 000 for all bids between bid
$1m and $2m (Prob(B < Br) = 1 for all bids less than $1m since it believes that the rival
never bids below $1m and Prob(B < Br) = 0 for all bids greater than $2m since it believes

that the rival never bids above $2m). Substituting this expression into the expected value

of the bid B we obtain: E[B] = (B ¡ 800; 000)[1 ¡ (B ¡ 1; 000; 000)=1; 000; 000].

From this expression it is clear that the bidder's payo® goes up with B but that its

chance of winning declines with B. Picking the optimal B entails ¯nding the maximum of

E[B], which we can easily obtain by taking the derivative of E[B], setting it equal to zero

and solving for B [¤] . This bid will be the point at which the two e®ects of changing B just

o®set each other. Dropping the zeros we have


@
= (1 ¡ (B [¤] ¡ 1)) ¡ (B [¤] ¡ :8) = 0
@ B [E][[][B][]]


5We say that an agent is risk neutral if he or she is indi®erent between receiving 100 for sure and receiving

0 or 200 with probability 50% each. More generally, a risk-neutral agent only cares about the expected value

of each outcome.
6By \uniformly distributed between a and b" we mean that all values between a and b are equally likely.


8


B [¤] ¡ :8 = 1 ¡ B [¤] + 1


B [¤] = 1:4m


An alternative approach to this problem is to construct a demand function from the

information you have about the market. You can then solve the problem in the same

way as you would with more straightforward problems in which you are given an explicit

demand function (i.e., set MR = MC and solve for Q [¤], then solve for B [¤] ). To see this
approach, note that the bid the ¯rm submits is just like a price. The higher its bid, the
lower its expected demand will be. In this case, demand falls as the price goes up because
the ¯rm's chance of winning is falling. Formally, expected demand, Q, at any level B is
equal to Q = 1 ¡ Prob(B < Br) = 1 ¡ (B ¡ 1; 000; 000)=1; 000; 000 = 2 ¡ B=1; 000; 000.
As this equation indicates, when the ¯rm's bid is equal to 1,000,000 demand will be 1 unit.
That is, the ¯rm is sure to win the contract. As its bid (the price) increases, demand
falls to some fraction of a unit until at 2,000,000 demand is zero. Since the contract is
a winner take all item, the idea of fractional units is not really correct, but if there were
say N consumers instead of a single consumer, and the ¯rm was bidding against other
¯rms for the business of each consumer, the aggregate demand function would then be
QN = N (2 ¡ B=1; 000; 000) = 2N ¡ B(N=1; 000; 000). This is like a simple linear demand
function.
To continue with this approach, we need to invert the demand function and solve for B to

¡ ¢ ¡
get B = 2; 000; 000 1; 000; 000 Q. The bidder's total revenue is then BQ = (2; 000; 000

¢
1; 000; 000 Q)Q. Taking the derivative of this total revenue function, we ¯nd that the

¡ ¢ ¢
marginal revenue of the ¯rm is 2; 000; 000 2 1; 000; 000 Q. As we would expect, the
marginal revenue curve has twice the slope of the inverse de-mand curve. We can then set
this marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost of 800,000 to get Q [¤] :


¡ ¢ ¢
800; 000 = 2; 000; 000 2 1; 000; 000 Q


¢ ¢
2 1; 000; 000 Q = 1; 200; 000


Q [¤] = 1:2=2 = :6


Substituting this value into our inverse demand function, we obtain the optimal bid of

¡
B(:6) = 2; 000; 000 (:6)1; 000; 000 = 1; 400; 000.


3.1 Explain why the assumption of pro¯t maximization is or is not reasonable?


Solution: The answer to this question is given by Section 3.1 in the book. The main reson
why we might think that the assumption of pro¯t maximization is not reasonable is that
the ¯rm managers are frequently not the ¯rm owners; and the goals of managers frequently


9


di®ers from those of the owners. However, it can be argued that the discipline imposed by
the shareholders, the labor market, the product market and the capital market are su±cient
to enforce pro¯t maximization. In particular, the threat of a takeover has been found to
have a signi¯cant e®ect on value maximization.


3.2 Should ¯rms have their own catering services or should they outsource it?

What are the main trade-o®s? Are their other alternatives in addition to \make or

buy"?


Solution: The answer to this question is given by Section 3.2 in the book.


3.3 Two parts in an automobile taillight are the plastic exterior cover and

the light bulb. Which of these parts is a car company more likely to manufacture

in-house? Why?


Solution: Light bulbs are a generally used homogeneous good. External suppliers enjoy

economies of scale and specialization and supply the entire industry. In contrast, the plastic

exterior cover must be custom-designed and manufactured for each make and model. Be
cause it requires more Relationship Speci¯c Investment (RSI), it is more likely to be made

in-house.


3.4 There are three main suppliers of commercial jet engines, Pratt & Whitney,

General Electric, and Rolls-Royce. All three maintain extensive support sta® at major

(and many minor) airports throughout the world. Why doesn't one ¯rm service each

airport? Why do all three feel they need to provide service and support operations

worldwide themselves? Why don't they subcontract this work? Why don't they leave

it entirely to the airlines?


Solution: Jet engines are marvelously idiosyncratic. The knowledge, tools and parts

needed to service one family (brand) of engines do not transfer fully across brands. One

¯rm does not typically service each airport because the economies of scale (across brands)

are small and the economies of specialization (within brand) are large. The only thing worse

for an airline than an AOG (an aircraft sitting on the ground with a broken engine) is an

aircraft °ying with a broken engine or two. To ensure their reputation and revenues and

to avoid ex post hold up, airlines demand before purchasing an aircraft that engine makers

pre-commit capital to ensure that parts and service are available at major stations world
wide. Because the skills to do this are RSIs, and because the engine owner's reputation is


10


at stake, to sell engines and credibly commit to keeping them running, each manufacturer

must provide service and support at major stations.

Subcontracting would be di±cult because of the RSI required (the subcontractor would

fear hold-up) and because a poor subcontractor would impose a negative externality on the

manufacturer. When the jet goes down, the manufacturer's reputation will su®er on a scale

beyond any contractual penalty a subcontractor could likely be held to, so the work is not

usually subcontracted. In addition, the manufacturers bene¯t directly from direct feedback

within the ¯rm on the performance of the engines they produce. This information may °ow

more readily within the ¯rm than across ¯rms.

Some airlines with su±cient scale do perform their own routine engine maintenance at

their own maintenance bases. However, the airlines cannot e±ciently do emergency engine

repairs away from an airline's main bases. While there are enough GE engines going through

Karachi International Airport to justify an on-site GE technical support sta®, most airlines

do not have enough °ights through Karachi to justify the investment. The economies of

scale in non-routine work are site and engine speci¯c, not generally airline speci¯c.


3.5 The Smart car was created as a joint venture between Daimler-Benz AG

and Swatch Group AG. Although Micro Compact Car AG (the name of the joint

venture) was originally jointly owned, in November of 1998 Daimler-Benz AG took

complete control by buying Swatch's share. [7] The deal put an end to a very stressed

relationship between Daimler and Swatch. What does Section 3.2 suggest as to what

the sources of strain might have been?


Solution: Section 3.2 suggests that, when two parties invest in speci¯c assets and contracts

are incomplete, the equilibrium solution is ine±cient in every situation short of vertical

integration. (See also the mathematical supplement corresponding to this section.) It

is likely that some of this happened in the \stressed relationship" between Daimler and

Swatch. Since none of the parties was in complete control (and ownership) of the future

developments in the joint venture, the incentives for each party to invest were less than

e±cient.


3.6 Why do television networks have a few \owned and operated" stations but

work through independent a±liates in most geographic locations?


Solution: See Exercise 3.7.

3.7 Empirical evidence from franchise retailing suggests that, even when stores

have similar characteristics, the mother company resorts to a mix between company
owned stores and franchised ones. [8] How can this be justi¯ed?


Solution: Franchisers face a problem in judging the performance of their franchisees.

Keeping some retail locations in-house provides the parent company with a baseline of

more readily accessible and less biased information against which the performance of the

franchises can be measured. This information then helps to set standards in negotiating and

administering future franchise contracts. Franchising the majority of retail locations limits

the parent's direct ¯nancial outlay and exposure. Franchisers might also have an interest

in direct control of locations that could have a particularly strong impact on its brand or

reputation.


3.8 The U.K. Body Shop franchise network consists of three types of stores:

franchised, company owned and partnership stores. All stores that are distant from

headquarters by more than 300 miles are franchised. More than half of the company
owned stores are within 100 miles of headquarters. [9] How can you explain these fact?


Solution: Owning a store has the advantages of vertical integration discussed in Section

3.2. However, it also has the problem that it requires increased monitoring by the store

owner. We would expect the costs from monitoring to be lower the closer the store is to

headquarters. Consequently, we would expect vertical integration to be more likely when

the store is located closer to headquarters. The empirical evidence seems consistent with

this hypothesis.


3.9 Explain why Intel has maintained, if not increased, its competitive advan
tage with respect to rivals. Indicate the explanatory power of the di®erent causes

considered in the text (impediments to imitation, causal ambiguity, strategy, history).


Solution: This is a complex question. In fact, as argued in this chapter, this is the
question in strategy. A good source for the particular case of Intel is the HBS case \Intel
Corporation: 1968{1997," No. 9{797{137 (Rev. October 21, 1998).

3.10 [¤¤¤] Suppose that a ¯rm's pro¯ts are given by ¼ = ® + Á(e) + ², where ®
denotes the intensity of product market competition, e e®ort by the manager, and
² a random shock. The function Á(e) is increasing and concave, that is, Á [0] - 0 and
Á [00] < 0.
In order for the ¯rm to survive, it must be that pro¯ts are greater than ¼. The
manager's payo® is ¯ > 0 if the ¯rm survives and zero if it is liquidated, that is, if
pro¯ts fall short of the minimum target. The idea is that if the ¯rm is liquidated,
then the manager loses his job and the rents associated with it.
Suppose that ² is normally distributed with mean ¹ and variance ¾ [2], and that
¹ > ¼. Show that increased product market competition (lower ®) induces greater
e®ort by the manager, that is, @ ®@ e [<][ 0.]


Solution: The manager's payo® is given by


P = ¯ P (® + Á(e) + ² > ¼) ¡ e;


where P(x > y) is the probability that x > y. Since ² is normally distributed, we have


P = ¯ (1 ¡ F (¼ ¡ ® ¡ Á(e))) ¡ e;


where F (x) is the probability that ² is less than x (cumulative distribution function). Taking

the derivative with respect to e, the manager's choice of e®ort level, we get


d P

[¡][ ®][ ¡][ Á][(][e][)))][ ¡][ 1][;]
d e [=][ ¯ f][ (][¼]


where f(x) is the density function of ². Since ¹ > ¼, ¹ > ¼ ¡ ® ¡ Á(e). Therefore

f (¼ ¡ ® ¡ Á(e))) is in the increasing portion of f . It follows that an increase in ® leads
to a decrease in f (¼ ¡ ® ¡ Á(e))); and this, in turn, implies a lower [d P]

d e [. Finally, a lower]
d P

d e [implies a lower value of][ e][. In words, a decrease in the degree of competition (higher][ ®][)]
decreases the marginal bene¯t from managerial e®ort ( [d P]

d e [), and ultimately leads to a lower]
e®ort of managerial e®ort (e).


4.1 What are the assumptions regarding player rationality implicit in solving a

game by elimination of dominated strategies? Contrast this with the case of dominant

strategies.


Solution: When applying the iterated elimination of dominated strategies one implicitly

assumes that each player is rational and believes that the other player is rational. With dom
inant strategies the only assumption needed is that players are rational, utility-maximizing

agents, regardless of their beliefs about other players.

4.2 The UK O±ce of Fair Trading has recently unveiled a plan that will o®er

immunity from prosecution to ¯rms who blow the whistle on their co-cartel conspira
tors. In the U.S., this tactic has proven extremely successful: since its introduction in

1993, the total amount of ¯nes for anti-competitive behavior has increased twentyfold.

Show how the tactic initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice and soon to be

followed by the O±ce of Fair Trading changes the rules of the game played between

¯rms in a secret cartel.


Solution: Prior to the introduction of the plan, each cartel ¯rm would have two options:

(a) to stick by the agreement or (b) to deviate and set lower prices. With the introduction of

the plan, the ¯rm has a third option: (c) to blow the whistle. Let ® be the probability that

the DOJ discovers the price conspiracy. High values of ® imply a low expected value from

(a). The same is true of (b), though probably to a lesser extent. Finally, (c) is invariant to

the value of ®. We would thus expect that, for high values of ®, (c) is the best strategy.

With the introduction of the plan, the ¯rms now play a second prisoner's dilemma type

of game. Before, it was whether to price high or price low. Now, it's whether to blow the

whistle or not. Firm would be better o® if neither of them blew the whistle. However, if ®

is high, the bblowing the whistle is a dominat strategy.


4.3 Figure 1 represents a series of two-player games which illustrate the ri
valry between Time magazine and Newsweek. Each magazine's strategy consists of
choosing a cover story: \Impeachment" or \Financial crisis" are the two choices. [10]


The ¯rst version of the game corresponds to the case when the game is symmetric

(Time and Newsweek are equally well positioned). As the payo® matrix suggests,

\Impeachment" is a better story but payo®s are lower when both magazines choose

the same story. The second version of the game corresponds to the assumption

that Time is a more popular magazine (Time's payo® is greater then Newsweek's

when both magazines cover the same story). Finally, the third version of the game

illustrates the case when the magazines are su±ciently di®erent that some readers

will buy both magazines even if they cover the same story.

For each of the three versions of the game,

(a) Determine whether the game can be solved by dominant strategies.

(b) Determine all Nash equilibria.

(c) Indicate clearly which assumptions regarding rationality are required in order

to reach the solutions in (a) and (b).


Solution:


(i) Impeachment is a dominat strategy for both players. It follows that (Impeachment, Im
peachment) is the unique Nash equilibrium. All we need to assume to reach this conclusion

is that players are rational and know their own payo®s.


10In each cell, the ¯rst number is the payo® for the row player (Time).

(i) Time and Newsweek are evenly matched


Newsweek

|Col1|Impeachment|Financial Crisis|
|---|---|---|
|Impeachment|42, 28|70, 30|
|Financial Crisis|30, 70|18, 12|



(ii) Time is more popular than Newsweek


Newsweek

|Col1|Impeachment|Financial Crisis|
|---|---|---|
|Impeachment|42, 28|70, 50|
|Financial Crisis|50, 70|30, 20|



(iii) Some customers will buy both magazines


Figure 1: The cover-story game.


(ii) Impeachment is a dominant strategy for Time, but not for Newsweek. Given that Time

chosses Impeachment, Financial Crisis is the optimal choice for Newsweek. It follows that

(Impeachment, Financial Crisis) is the unique Nash equilibrium. This solution assumes that

Time is rational and knows its payo®s; and Newsweek is rational, knows the payo®s for both

players, and believes Time is a rational player.


(iii) There are no dominant strategies in this game. There are two Nash equilibria (in pure

strategies): (Impeachment, Financial Crisis) and (Fiancial Crisis, Impeachment). In this

context, the concept of Nash equilibrium pressuposes that players know the payo®s of both

players; moreover, it is common knowledge (I expect that you expect that I expect...) that

the particular equilibrium will be played.


4.4 [¤] In the movie \E.T.," a trail of Reese's Pieces, one of Hershey's chocolate

brands, is used to lure the little alien out of the woods. As a result of the publicity

created by this scene, sales of Reese's Pieces trebled, allowing Hershey to catch up

with rival Mars.

Universal Studio's original plan was to use a trail of Mars' M&Ms. However,

Mars turned down the o®er, presumably because it thought $1m was a very high

price. The makers of \E.T." then turned to Hershey, who accepted the deal.

Figure 2: Mars vs Hershey. ai and ri signify acceptance and rejection by ¯rm i, respectively.


Suppose that the publicity generated by having M&Ms included in the movie

would increase Mars' pro¯ts by $800,000. Suppose moreover that Hershey's increase

in market share cost Mars a loss of $500,000. Finally, let b be the bene¯t for Hershey's

from having its brand be the chosen one.

Describe the above events as a game in extensive form. Determine the equilibrium

as a function of b. If the equilibrium di®ers from the actual events, how do you think

they can be reconciled?


Solution:

As can be seen from Figure 2, if b > $1; 000; 000 then Hershey's equilibrium strategy is to

accept the o®er; likewise, Mars' equilibrium strategy is to accept the o®er. If b < $1; 000; 000,

however, then the equilibrium strategies is for both ¯rms to turn down the o®er.

This di®ers from what actually happened (Mars rejected the o®er, whereas Hershey

accepted it). One possible explanation is that Mars underestimated either its own bene¯ts

from having M&Ms featured in the movie, or Hershey's bene¯ts, or both.


4.5 Hernan Cort¶ez, the Spanish navigator and explorer, is said to have burnt

his ships upon arrival to Mexico. By so doing, he e®ectively eliminated the option of

him and his soldiers returning to their homeland. Discuss the strategic value of this

action knowing the Spanish colonists were faced with potential resistance from the

Mexican natives.

Figure 3: The HDTV game: each country chooses a high or a low level of R&D on HDTV.


Solution: By eliminating the option of turning back, Hernan Cortez established a credible

commitment regarding his future actions, that is, to ¯ght the Mexican natives should they

attack. Had Cortez not made this move, natives could have found it better to attack,

knowing that instead of bearing losses the Spaniards would prefer to withdraw.


4.6 Consider the following game depicting the process of standard setting in
high-de¯nition television (HDTV). [11] The U.S. and Japan must simultaneously decide

whether to invest a high or a low value into HDTV research. Each country's payo®s

are summarized in Figure 3.

(a) Are there any dominant strategies in this game? What is the Nash equilibrium

of the game? What are the rationality assumptions implicit in this equilibrium?

(b) Suppose now the U.S. has the option of committing to a strategy ahead of

Japan's decision. How would you model this new situation? What are the Nash

equilibria of this new game?

(c) Comparing the answers to (a) and (b), what can you say about the value of

commitment for the U.S.?

(d) \When pre-commitment has a strategic value, the player that makes that com
mitment ends up `regretting' its actions, in the sense that, given the rivals' choices, it

could achieve a higher payo® by choosing a di®erent action." In light of your answer

to (b), how would you comment this statement?


Solution: (a) For the United States investing, a low value in HDTV research is a dominant

strategy. The Nash equilibrium of the game is given by the U.S. choosing Low and Japan

choosing High. The rationality assumptions implicit in this solution are that both players

are rational and, moreover, Japan belives the U.S. acts rationally.

(b) See Figure 3. (See also Section 4.2.) By solving backwards, with get the following

Nash equilibrium: U.S. chooses High, Japan chooses Low.

(c) Comparing the answers from a. and b. we can see that the value of commitment to

the U.S. is 1 that is, 3 minus 2.

(d) Given that Japan chooses Low, the U.S. would be better o® by choosing Low as well.

However, it must be the case that the cost of switching from High to Low is so high that

the U.S. won't do it (ex post). Otherwise, the commitment to stick to High would not be

credible.


4.7 Consider a one-shot game with two equilibria and suppose this game is

repeated twice. Explain in words why there may be equilibria in the two-period

game which are di®erent from the equilibria of the one-shot game.


Solution: When the game is repeated twice the strategy space for each player becomes

more complex. Each player's strategy speci¯es the action to be taken in period 1 as well as

the action to be taken in period 2 as a function of the outcome in period 1. The possibility of

linking period 2's actions to past actions allows for equilibrium outcomes that would not be

attainable in the corresponding one-shot game (for example, the use of a 'punishment' action

in period 2 if one of the players deviates from the designated period 1 payo®-maximizing

action).


4.8 [¤¤] Consider the game in Figure 4. [1][2] Show, by backward induction, that

rational players choose d at every node of the game, yielding a payo® of 2 for Player

1 and zero for Player 2. Is this equilibrium reasonable? What are the rationality

assumptions implicit in it?


Solution: [IMPORTANT NOTE: there is a typo in the game tree: the payo®s in the

second and third to last nodes should be increased by 2.]


12This game was ¯rst proposed by


Rosenthal, Robert (1981), \Games of Perfect Information, Predatory Pricing and the Chain-Store Para
dox," Journal of Economic Theory 25, 92{100.


18


Starting from the right-most node, we observe that Player 2's strategy, if that node is

reached, is to play d, in which case its gets 101, whereas Player 1 gets 99. This implies that,

in the second to last node, Player 1 is better o® choosing d. In fact, by choosing r, Player

1 expects to get 99 (see sentence above) instead of 100 from d. And so forth. We conclude

that the unique sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium is for each player to play d whenever it

is called upon to make a move. The outcome of this equilibrium is Player 1 getting 2 and

Player 2 getting 0.

Obviously, one might question whether this result is reasonable or not. Here, the implicit

assumption is that each player is rational, believes that the other player is rational, believes

that the other player believes that the ¯rst player is rational, and so forth.

To see how important this assumption is, suppose that Player 1 chooses r in the ¯rst

period. Since this is not according to the equilibrium, Player 2 may not conjecture that

Player 1 is not rational. But then chosing d may no longer be in Player 2's best interest.

But then chosing r may be, after all, a rational strategy by Player 1 in the ¯rst place.


5.1 \The degree of monopoly power is limited by the elasticity of demand."

Comment.


Solution: Optimal monopoly pricing leads to the following relation between the price-cost
margin and demand elasticity: (p ¡ MC )=p = 1=², where p is price, MC marginal cost, and
e demand elasticity. It follows that the greater the value of ² the lower the value of (p¡MC )
and the lower monopoly pro¯ts. A monopolist facing a very elastic demand curve makes

pro¯ts at the level of a competitive ¯rm.


5.2 A ¯rm sells one million units at a price of $100 each. The ¯rm's marginal

cost is constant at $40, and its average cost (at the output level of one million units)

is $90. The ¯rm estimates that its elasticity of demand is constant at 2.0. Should

the ¯rm raise price, lower price, or leave price unchanged? Explain.


Solution: Optimal monopoly pricing leads to the following relation between the price,
marginal cost, and demand elasticity: (p ¡ MC )=p = 1=², where p is price, MC is marginal
cost, and ² is the elasticity of demand. In this problem, we have (p¡MC )=p = (100¡40)=100
or 0.6, which is greater than 1=² = 1=2 = 0:5. This tells us that the price/cost margin is
too high, so a lower price ($80) would be optimal. It would be a mistake to use AC rather

than MC for the purposes of calculating the price/cost margin.

5.3 A recent study estimates the long-run demand elasticity of AT&T in the

period 1988{1991 to be around 10. [1][3] Assuming the estimate is correct, what does

this imply in terms of AT&T's market power?


Solution: A demand elasticity of 10 implies that AT&T's demand is very elastic. In

fact, the author of the study that produced this estimate computes the welfare loss due to

AT&T's market power to be less than 1% of sales volume.


5.4 Sprint currently o®ers long-distance telephone service to residential cus
tomers at a price of 8c per minute. At this price, Sprint sells 200 million minutes of

calling per day. Sprint believe that its marginal cost per minute of calling is 5c. So,

Sprint's residential long-distance telephone service business is contributing $6 million

per day towards overhead/¯xed costs.

Based on a statistical study of calling patterns, Sprint estimates that it faces a

constant elasticity of demand for long-distance calling by residential customers of 2.0.

(a) Based on this information, should Sprint raise, lower, or leave unchanged its

price?

(b) How much additional contribution to overhead, if any, can Sprint obtain by

optimally adjusting its price?


Solution:


(a) Given the elasticity of demand for long-distance, the optimal price is given by p = MC ²=(²¡
1). The optimal price is thus 0:05 ¢ 2=1 = :10. Sprint should raise its price from 0.08 to 0.10.


(b) The demand curve in this case has constant elasticity. The general formula for demand

with constant elasticity is q = Qp [¡][²], where A is a positive constant. We can ¯nd A in this
problem by substituting p and Q (p = 8; Q = 200) into the formula. The result is that
A = 12; 800. Substituting the optimal value p = :10 into the above, q = (12; 800)(:10) [¡][2],
gives 128 million minutes a day.
The contribution to ¯xed cost is 128(:10 ¡ :05) = $6:4m. Repricing yields higher pro¯ts
of $400,000 per day.


5.5 After spending 10 years and $1.5 billion, you have ¯nally gotten Food and

Drug Administration (FDA) approval to sell your new patented wonder drug, which

reduces the aches and pains associated with aging joints. You will market this drug

under the brand name of Ageless. Market research indicates that the elasticity of


13


Ward, Michael R. (1995), \Measurements of Market Power in Long Distance Telecommunications," Federal
Trade Commission, Bureau of Economics Sta® Report..


20


demand for Ageless is 1.25 (at all points on the demand curve). You estimate the

marginal cost of manufacturing and selling one more dose of Ageless is $1.

(a) What is the pro¯t-maximizing price per dose of Ageless?

(b) Would you expect the elasticity of demand you face for Ageless to rise or fall

when your patent expires?


Solution:


(a) Our general markup rule states that (p ¡ MC )=p = 1=², where ² is the elasticity of demand
facing the ¯rm at the point on the demand curve at which the ¯rm operates. With a constant

elasticity of demand and constant marginal cost, as in this problem, we can use this formula

to solve directly for the pro¯t-maximizing price, p [¤] . Here we get (p [¤] ¡ 1)=p [¤] = 1=1:25.
Solving for the optimal price gives p [¤] = $5. Equivalently, one can directly use the other
version of the markup formula, p = MC ²=(² ¡ 1), to get p = 1 £ 1:25=(1:25 ¡ 1), which again
gives p [¤] = $5. Of course, the R&D expenditures are now sunk and thus do not enter into
the pricing decision.


(b) The level of demand for Ageless must fall now that there are many very close substitutes

in the form of generic versions. Hopefully, your brand will still allow you to command a

premium price, but surely at any given price you will sell less as a result of the presence of

the generic competition.

The elasticity of demand for Ageless will very likely rise now that closer substitutes are

available. Customers will presumably be more price sensitive, and thus will induce you to

set a lower price.


5.6 Is the Windows operating system an essential facility? What about the

Intel Pentium microprocessor? To what extent does the discussion in Section ?? on

essential facilities (vertical integration, access pricing) apply to the above examples?


Solution: [Note: this is a very controversial question and not all economists agree on a

single answer.] Both Microsoft (the producer of the Windows operating system) and Intel

(the producer of the Intel Pentium microprocessor) provide computer makers with essential

components, without which the machines could not function. Nevertheless, strictly speaking,

we cannot say that their output represents an essential facility. The discussion in section 5.3

applies to monopolists. The crucial di®erence from the examples presented in the section

is the fact that Microsoft and Intel are not monopolists: computer makers always have the

option of switching to another provider of components.

However, the widespread use of the Windows operating system, and the fact that Win
dows is only supplied by Microsoft, implies that the latter's position is much closer to the

one of a monopolist than is Intel's. Even though Intel's chip design is very close to being

an industry standard, Intel is not the only company supplying microprocessors with that


21


desing. Hence, the Windows operating system is closer to what is called an essential facility

than Intel's Pentium processor.


6.1 The technology of book publishing is characterized by a high ¯xed cost

(typesetting the book) and a very low marginal cost (printing). Prices are set at much

higher levels than marginal cost. However, book publishing yields a normal rate of

return. Are these facts consistent with pro¯t maximizing behavior by publishers?

Which model do you think describes this industry best?


Solution: The model of monopolistic competition is probably the best approximation to

describing this industry. The model of monopolistic competition shows that price-making,

pro¯t-maximizing behavior is consistent with a zero-pro¯t long-run equilibrium. The strong

scale economies in book publishing imply that the gap between price and marginal cost is

particularly high.


6.2 The market for laundry detergent is monopolistically competitive. Each

¯rm owns one brand, and each brand has e®ectively di®erentiated itself so that is has

some market power (i.e., faces a downward sloping demand curve). Still, no brand

earns economic pro¯ts, because entry causes the demand for each brand to shift in

until the seller can just break even. All ¯rms have identical cost functions, which are

U-shaped.

Suppose that the government does a study on detergents and ¯nds out they are

all alike. The public is noti¯ed of these ¯ndings and suddenly drops allegiance to

any brand. What happens to price when this product that was brand-di®erentiated

becomes a commodity? What happens to total sales? What happens to the number

of ¯rms in the market?


Solution: Based on the information provided, it seems that the initial situation in this

market is like the long-run equilibrium of the monopolistic competition model; see Figure 6.3.

The government's announcement has turned a di®erentiated product into a homogeneous

one. In terms of the graph in Figure 6.3, this implies a °attening of the demand curve faced

by each ¯rm and a new long-run equilibrium where d (now horizontal) is tangent to the AC
curve. At this new long-run equilibrium, price is given by p [0] LR [and each ¯rm's output is]
given by qLR [0] [.]
Clearly, the new equilibrium implies a lower price and a higher output per ¯rm: p [0] LR [<]
pLR and qLR [0] [> q][LR][.]
Suppose that price were to drop from pLR to p [0] LR [without changing the degree of product]
di®erentiation or the number of ¯rms. This would imply an output per ¯rm equal to qSR [0] [,]
where qSR [0] [is greater than][ q][LR][ but lower than][ q] LR [0] [. If we take into account the disappearance]


22


of product di®erentiation (and continue with the same number of ¯rms), then the output

per ¯rm would be less than qSR [0] [. Whatever the exact value is, each ¯rm would be losing]
money (p [0] LR [< AC][). Therefore, in the post-announcement long-run equilibrium, some ¯rms]
will need to exit the market.

Finally, it is not clear what will happen to total output. On the one hand, each ¯rm's

output goes up. On the other hand, the number of ¯rms goes down. Which e®ect dominates

depends on how consumers value product di®erentiation and how the demand curve shifts

as a result of the government announcement.


6.3 [¤¤] Show that, in a long-run equilibrium with free entry and equal access to

the best available technologies, the comparison of price to the minimum of average

cost or the comparison of price to marginal cost are equivalent tests of allocative

e±ciency. In other words, price is greater than the minimum of average costs if and

only if price is greater than marginal cost.

Show, by example, that the same is not true in general.


Solution: We ¯rst show the following fact: marginal cost is greater than average cost if

and only if average cost is increasing. To see this, notice that Average Cost is given by the

ratio Cost / Output. Taking the derivative with respect to Output q, we get



d AC




[d] C

d q q



AC

= [d]
d q



q [=]



d C



q [q][ ¡][ C]



= (MC ¡ AC )=q;
q [2]



which shows the fact.

In the long-run equilibrium of an industry with equal access, each ¯rm will be producing

at a point in the left-hand portion of its Average Cost curve. Given the above fact, it follows

that marginal cost is lower than or equalt to average cost. Since there is free entry, price is

equal to average cost. Speci¯cally, either price is equal to the minimum of average cost and

equal to marginal cost; or price is greater than the minimum of average cost and greater

than marginal cost.

The same is not true, for example, in a short-run equilibrium. Consider the case of

perfect competition. and suppose that price is greater than the minimum of average cost.

Since ¯rms are price takers, price is equal to marginal cost. So, the comparison price minus

marginal cost is zero whereas price minus the minimum of average cost is positive.


7.1 According to Bertrand's theory, price competition drives ¯rms' pro¯ts down

to zero even if there are only two competitors in the market. Why don't we observe

this in practice very often?


23


Solution: Section 7.2 suggests three possible explanations: (a) product di®erentiation,

(b) dynamic competition, (c) capacity constraints.


7.2 Three criticisms are frequently raised against the use of the Cournot oligopoly

model: (i) ¯rms normally choose prices, not quantities; (ii) ¯rms don't normally take

their decisions simultaneously; (iii) ¯rms are frequently ignorant of their rivals' costs;

in fact, they do not use the notion of Nash equilibrium when making their strategic

decisions.

How would you respond to these criticisms? (Hint: in addition to this chapter,

you may want to refer to Chapter ??.)


Solution:


(i) If ¯rms are capacity constraint, then price competition \looks like" like quatitiy competition.

See Section 7.2.


(ii) If there are signi¯cant information lags, then sequential decisions \look like" simultaneous

decisions. See Chapter 4 (¯rst section).


(iii) The last section of Chapter 7 presents an argument for the relevance of Nash equilibrium

which only requires each ¯rm to know its own pro¯t function.


7.3 Which model (Cournot, Bertrand) would you think provides a better approx
imation to each of the following industries: oil re¯ning, internet access, insurance.

Why?


Solution: Capacity constraints seem relatively more important in oil re¯ning and relatively

less important in insurance. Given the discussion in Section 7.4, one would be inclined to

select the Cournot model for oil re¯ning and the Bertrand model for insurance. Internet

access is an intermediate case between the previous two.


7.4 [¤] Two ¯rms, CS nd LC, make identical goods, GPX units, and sell them
in the same market. The demand in the market is Q = 1200 ¡ P . Once a ¯rm has
built capacity, it can produce up to its capacity each period with a marginal cost of

MC = 0. Building a unit of capacity costs 2400 (for either CS or LC) and a unit

of capacity lasts four years. The interest rate is zero. Once production occurs each

period, the price in the market adjusts to the level at which all production is sold.

(In other words, these ¯rms engage in quantity competition, not price competition.)

(a) If CS knew that LC were going to build 100 units of capacity, how much
would CS want to build? If CS knew that LC were going to build x units of capacity,

how much would CS want to build (that is, what is CS's best response function in

capacity)?

(b) If CS and LC each had to decide how much capacity to build without knowing

the other's capacity decision, what would the one-shot Nash equilibrium be in the

amount of capacity built?


Solution:


(a) If LC builds 100 units of capacity, then CS faces a residual demand of QCS = Q ¡ 100 =
1100 ¡ p. Its marginal revenue (contribution) is then MR CS = 1100 ¡ 2QCS. Equating
this marginal revenue with CS's capacity costs of 600 yields the optimal capacity for CS as
Q [¤] CS [= 250 units.]
The generalization of this is to solve for CS's residual demand as a function of LC's

capacity QLC. That is, QCS = Q ¡ QLC = 1200 ¡ QLC ¡ p. CS's total revenue is then equal
to TR CS = pQCS = (1200 ¡ QLC + QCS)QCS and its marginal revenue can be obtained
by taking the derivative of TR CS with respect to QCS (treating QLC as a constant). This
yields MR CS = 1200 ¡ QLC ¡ 2QCS. Equating this marginal revenue to marginal cost and
solving for QCS yields QCS = 300 ¡ QLC=2 as CS's optimal capacity in response to any
capacity decision by LC.


(b) Since the two ¯rms are symmetric, LC's best response to CS is analogous to CS's best
response to LC, or QLC = 300 ¡ QCS=2. A Nash equilibrium requires that Q [¤] LC [= 300][ ¡]
Q [¤] CS [=][2 and][ Q][¤] CS [= 300][ ¡][ Q][¤] LC [=][2. Substituting][ Q][¤] LC [into][ Q][¤] CS [and solving for][ Q][¤] CS [yields]
Q [¤] CS [= 200. Substituting this amount into the LC's best response function yields][ Q][¤] LC [=]
200. At these capacities the market price is p = 1200 ¡ 200 ¡ 200 = 800. Each ¯rm's pro¯ts
are then (800 ¡ 600)(200) = $40; 000.


7.5 [¤] Consider a market for a homogeneous product with demand given by
Q = 37:5 ¡ P=4. There are two ¯rms, each with constant marginal cost equal to 40.
a) Determine output and price under a Cournot equilibrium.

b) Compute the e±ciency loss as a percentage of the e±ciency loss under monopoly.


Solution: (a) Duopolist i's pro¯t is given by


¼i = qip(Q) ¡ C(qi) = qi[150 ¡ 4(qi + qj)] ¡ 40qi;


where the term in the square brackets comes from the demand function. The ¯rst order
condition for pro¯t maximization is given by:


150 ¡ 4(qi + qj) ¡ 4qi ¡ 40 = 0: (1)


By symmetry, we have qi = qj = 9:166. Also, p = 150 ¡ 8qi = 76:666.
