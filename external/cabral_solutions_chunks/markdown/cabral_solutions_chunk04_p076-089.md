15.7 [¤¤¤] A large fraction of industry entry corresponds to acquisition of incumbent

¯rms. For example, from a sample of 3,788 entry events, about 70% were acquisitions. [4][1] Econometric analysis suggests that entry by acquisition is more common in
more concentrated industries. [42] Can you explain this observation?

Suggestion: Consider a Cournot oligopoly with n symmetric ¯rms. Determine

the maximum that an entrant would be willing to pay for one of the incumbent ¯rms.

Determine also the minimum that an incumbent would require from a buyer, knowing

that the alternative to selling the ¯rm is for the entrant to create a new ¯rm. Show

that the di®erence between the two values above is greater when the industry is more
concentrated. [43]


What other factors would you expect to in°uence the \build or buy" decision

when entering an industry?


Solution: Suppose that p = a ¡ bQ and c(q) = cq + F . Every ¯rm solves max[(a ¡ c ¡
bQ)q ¡F ], with the solution being qi = b(an¡+1)c [. In a symmetric equilibrium all ¯rms produce]

a¡c 2 n
the same quantity, and the pro¯ts would be ¼i [(][n][)] = ³ n+1 ´ b [¡][ F] [. Therefore, a buyer is]

willing to pay up to ³ na¡+1c ´2 nb [¡][ F][ to aquire an incumbent ¯rm. If the buyer decides to]

enter, the number of ¯rms in the industry becomes n + 1, hence each ¯rm's pro¯t is given

by ¼i [(][n][+1)] = ³ na¡+2c ´2 n+1b ¡ F . This is also the minimum that a target would require.



The di®erence is given by ¢ = ¼i [(][n][+1)] ¡ ¼i [(][n][)] = ³ na¡+1c ´2 nb

n greater or equal to 2.
In industries with a large number of ¯rms, the value of a potential target does not go

down to much if the potential acquirer enters by building a new plant. Adding one more

¯rm in an industry with a big number of players results in a marginal decrease in pro¯ts.

On the other hand, if the industry is concentrated, adding one more ¯rm leads to a large

drop in pro¯ts, hence, the potential target prefers to be acquired.

One other reason why acquisition may be thought of as a good strategy is the time

necessary to build a new plant. Acquisition gives the right to the ¯rms pro¯ts in a \short"

time, while a new plant needs time to become established as a player in the industry.

16.1 \Perfect competition is not only impossible but inferior, and has no title
to being set up as a model of ideal e±ciency." Do you agree? Why or why not?


Solution: In a static sense, perfect competition is the most e±cient industry structure,

since it maximizes social welfare. In a dynamic sense, however, perfect competition is not

necessarily the ideal model, since it may be less conducive to technological progress than

situations that allow for some (temporary) degree of market power. The latter would not

necessarily be monopoly markets (in a static sense) but rather forms of oligopoly, in which

¯rms compete not only in quantity (or price) but also in R&D, so that they can outpower

rivals in the future and gain some market power.


16.2 \ºcompetition implies a dynamic system whereby industries tend to become

more and more concentrated." Do you agree? Why or why not?


Solution: There is no clear answer to this question. The reason why industries would

move towards a higher concentration is the presence of a steep learning curve (see the case

of the wide-body aircraft manufacturing industry). If one of the ¯rms is moving faster down

the learning curve than its rivals, it can end up in a position where its competitive advantage

is big enough so that it remains the sole major player in the industry.

On the other hand, we saw that if there is uncertainty regarding the threat of entry,

outsiders have a greater incentive to perform R&D, which implies a higher lielihood of entry

and the industry becomes more competitive.


16.3 Two ¯rms are engaged in Bertrand competition. There are 10,000 people

in the population, each of whom is willing to pay at most 10 for at most one unit of

the good. Currently, both ¯rms have a constant marginal cost of 5.

(a) What is the equilibrium in this market? What are the ¯rms' pro¯ts?

(b) Suppose that one ¯rm can adopt a new technology that lowers its marginal

cost to 3. What is the equilibrium now? How much would this ¯rm be willing to pay

for this new technology?

(c) Suppose the new technology mentioned in (b) is available to both ¯rms. The

cost to a ¯rm of purchasing this technology is 10,000. The game is now played in two

stages. First, the ¯rms simultaneously decide whether to adopt the new technology

or not. Then, in the second stage, the ¯rms set prices simultaneously. Assume that

each ¯rm knows whether or not its rival acquired the new technology when choosing

its prices. What is (are) the Nash equilibrium (equilibria) of this game? (What does

your answer suggest about why ¯rms engage in patent races?) [44]


Solution:


44Adapted from Haas School of Business economics problem sets.


77


(a) Both ¯rms charge p = 5 and earn ¼ = 0.


(b) The ¯rm with the lower cost technology charges a fraction of a cent less than p = 5 and
sells to all 10,000 customers. Its pro¯ts are ¼ = [(5 ¡ 3) ¢ 10; 000] = 20; 000. It would be
willing to pay up to 20,000 for this technology.


(c) There are two pure-strategy equilibria: (1) ¯rm 1 invests in the low-cost technology and

¯rm 2 does not, and (2) ¯rm 2 invests in the low-cost technology and ¯rm 1 does not. It

is not an equilibrium for both ¯rms to invest or for neither ¯rm to invest. (There is also a

mixed strategy equilibrium in which each ¯rm invests with probability 0.5.)


16.4 [¤] In 1984, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that allowed generic-drug

makers to receive fast marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration

(FDA). Since then, the market share of generic-drug companies has increased con
siderably (in volume). Branded-drug companies have attempted di®erent tactics to

protect their market share. In some cases, large pharmaceutical ¯rms have paid

generic ¯rms to keep o® the market. Ivax Corp. and Novartis AG, for example, have

agreed not to market a generic competitor to Abbott Laboratories' hypertension drug
Hytrin. In exchange, Abott pays quarterly fees totaling several million dollars. [4][5]


Compare this example to the discussion on the persistence of monopoly power.


Solution: Suppose for simplicity that Abbot Laboratories is a monopolist on the hyper
tension drug market. From Section 16.2, we know that a monopolist has a greater incentive

to maintain its monopoly power than a rival has to enter. In other words, the monopolist

has more to loose from competition than the rival has to gain (the e±ciency e®ect). There

are therefore potential gains from an agreement like to one described above.


16.5 Patent life is 17 years in the U.S. and 20 years in Europe. From the

perspective of social welfare, do you ¯nd this period too short or too long?


Solution: The discussion in Section 16.3 suggests that it is optimal to provide relatively

weak patents for relatively long periods of time.


16.6 Should ¯rms be allowed to enter into agreements regarding R&D?


Solution: R&D agreements between ¯rms help alleviate the free-rider problem occuring

due to the inevitable spillovers from R&D activity. Moreover, such agreements help reduce

the risk associated with an R&D project. There might also be important synergies stemming


45The Wall Street Journal Europe, November 19, 1998.


78


from the combination of experience, intellectual and mental resources and so on. On the

other hand, if spillovers are low and the gain from R&D to a ¯rm is a loss to another, then

R&D joint ventures may lead to an undesirable reduction in R&D expenditures. See Section

16.3.


17.1 [¤] You have created a business-to-business (B2B) Internet venture directed

at an industry with exactly ¯fty (50) identical ¯rms. Your services allow these ¯rms

to do business with each other more e±ciently as members of your trading network.
You plan to sell access to your service for a price p per member ¯rm. Each ¯rm's
bene¯t from the service is given by 2n, where n is the number of other ¯rms joining
the B2B network as a member. So, if 21 ¯rms join your service, each places a value

of 2 £ 20 or 40 on membership in your network.

Suppose for part (a) that you set the price, p, and then ¯rms simultaneously and
independently decide whether or not to join as members.

(a) Show that, for a price greater than zero and lower than 98, there exist exactly

two Nash equilibria in the simultaneous-move game played by ¯rms deciding whether

or not to join the network as members.

Suppose for part (b) that you are able to persuade 10 ¯rms to join your network

at an initial stage as \Charter Members." At a second stage, you set a price for

the remaining 40 ¯rms. These 40 ¯rms then simultaneously decide (as in part (a))

whether to join your network as regular members.

(b) For each price p, determine the equilibria of the game played between the
remaining 40 ¯rms in the second stage.

Finally, for part (c), consider the same situation as in part (c), but suppose that,

when there are multiple Nash equilibria, ¯rms behave conservatively and conjecture

that the low-adoption Nash equilibrium will be played. (Note that, by the de¯nition

of Nash equilibrium, this conjecture is self-ful¯lling.)

(c) How much would you be willing to pay (in total to all 10 early adopters) in

order to persuade the ¯rst 10 ¯rms to join the network as Charter Members?


Solution:


(a) Suppose that no ¯rm joins the network. Then the bene¯t for an individual ¯rm to join the
network is zero. If price is positive, the net bene¯t is negative, which implies that it is a
best response not to join the network, which in turn con¯rms the conjecture that no ¯rm
joins the network. We thus have a Nash equilibrium where no ¯rm joins the network for
any positive price.
Suppose now that each ¯rm conjectures that all of the other ¯rms will join the network.
The expected bene¯t from joining the network is therefore 98 = 2 £ 49. If price is less than
98, the net bene¯t is positive, which in turn con¯rms the conjecture that all ¯rms join the
network. We thus have a Nash equilibrium where all ¯rms join the network for a price less
than 98.


79


Suppose that you are able to persuade 10 ¯rms to join the network at an initial stage. At
a second stage, you set a price for the remaining 40 ¯rms. These 40 ¯rms then simultaneously
decide whether to join the network (as in (a)).


(b) Each of the second-mover ¯rms knows that the number of adopters is at least 10. It follows
that the bene¯t from joining the network is at least 2 £ 10 = 20. Therefore, if price is less
than 20, then the zero-adoption equilibrium is no longer a Nash equilibrium. Only the fulladoption equilibrium remains. For higher prices, however, the two equilibria are possible,
for the same reasons as in (a).
Suppose that, when there are multiple Nash equilibria, ¯rms behave conservatively and
conjecture that the low-adoption equilibrium will be played. (Note that, by de¯nition of
Nash equilibrium, this conjecture is self-ful¯lling.)


(c) If no ¯rm joins the network in the ¯rst stage, then the game in the second stage is as
described in (a). Since for any positive price there are two equilibria and ¯rms behave
\conservatively", it follows that no ¯rm joins the network in the second stage and pro¯ts
are zero. If however the 10 ¯rms do join the network at the initial stage, then, in the second
stage, you can set a price of up to 20 and know that all ¯rms will join the network (since
this is the only Nash equilibrium and ¯rms know that; in fact, joining the network would be
a dominant strategy). For a price P = 20, this leads to pro¯ts 20 £ 40 = 600. We conclude
that you should be willing to spend up to 600 to persuade the ¯rst 10 ¯rms to join the
network.


17.2 Empirical evidence suggests that, between 1986 and 1991, consumers were

willing to pay a signi¯cant premium for spreadsheets that were compatible with

the Lotus platform, the dominant spreadsheet during that period. [4][6] What type of

network externalities is this evidence of?


Solution: One can think of this both as a type of direct and indirect externality. For
example, exchanging ¯les with users of the Lotus package, one has to own a compatible
spreadsheet. This is a case of direct network externality. On the other hand, developments
in the Lotus software can (potentially) be easily adapted and adopted by compatible software
products, which is a case of indirect network externality.


17.3 People are more likely to buy their ¯rst home computer in areas where

a high fraction of households already own computers or where a large share of their

nalities," Rand Journal of Economics 25, 160{170..


80


friends and family own computers: a ten percent greater penetration in the surround
ing city is associated with a one percent higher adoption rate. [4][7] How can this be

explained by network externalities? What alternative explanations are there?


Solution: The larger the number of households/friends that own computers, the larger the

the possibilities for direct communication among users and the greater utility one derives

from owning a computer. Communication among users may consist of email exchange,

learning how to use a given software, exchange of ¯les, and so forth.

An alternative explanation is that certain areas attract more \sophisticaded" users than

other areas. If this were the case, those areas would have a higher penetration rate and a

higher adoption rate. But then the correlation between penetration and adoption would be

just that|correlation, not causality. Another situation of correlation-not-causality is when

a higher penetration implies a greater degree of competition in the computer market, lower

prices and a higher adoption rate.

See the cited reference for additional alternative explanations.


17.4 [¤¤] In the early days of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), there were

very few interbank networks, that is, each bank's network was incompatible with

the other banks'. Empirical evidence shows that banks with a larger network of

branches adopted ATMs earlier. To what extent can network externalities explain

this observation? [4][8]


Solution: Network e®ects imply that the value of using a given ATM system is increasing

in the number of ATM machines compatible with that system. Part of the value created

by a network is gained by the consumer, part by the banks. Assuming (as is empirically

observed) that the cost of adoption is decreasing over time, the above observation implies

that the critical moment in time at which it pays to adopt ATMs is earlier the greater the

netowrk e®ect. Since the number of branches is a good proxy for the number of ATMs, this

implies that banks with a greater number of ATM machines are likely to adopt ¯rst, as the

evidence shows was indeed the case.

Apple Computer, the company that brought you the idiot-friendly Macin
tosh, is staring at bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the great army of technocrats

at Microsoft, which only last year managed to reproduce the look and feel

of a 1980's Mac, lumbers on, invincible.

A bad break for Apple? A rare exception to the Darwinian rules in which
the best products win the hearts and dollars of consumers? [4][9]


Solution: This is an instance of how network externalities work and how \the best

technology" does not always win. As in Section 17.2, it is possible that the lock-in to the

Microsoft operationg system resulted from a series of \small historial events," not from the

inherent superiority of the Microsoft operating system.


17.6 [¤] Consider the model of technology adoption presented in Section ??. Sup
pose that the utility derived by an A fan from technology A is given by u + nA if nA
is less than ¹nA, and u + ¹nA for values of n greater than ¹nA. Likewise utility from
buying technology B is as before except that for nB greater thank ¹nB we get ¹nB.
Analogous expressions apply for B fans. In other words, network externalities are

bounded: once the network reaches a certain size, no additional bene¯ts are gained

from a larger network.

Show that, under these circumstances and for certain values of u; v, three di®erent

outcomes are possible: (a) the industry becomes locked-in to technology A; (b) the

industry becomes locked-in to technology B; (c) the two technologies survive in the

long run.


Solution: One can distinguish 3 cases:

a) If u + ~~n~~ A   - ~~n~~ B then all future adopters will prefer technology B;
b) If u + ~~n~~ B   - ~~n~~ A then all future adopters will prefer technolgy A;
c) If u + ~~n~~ B = ~~n~~ A or u + ~~n~~ A   - ~~n~~ B then adopters that would prefer technology B (and
respectively A) are indi®erent, therefore both technologies will survive.


17.7 Explain why the market adoption of a new technology may be too fast or

to slow.


Solution: The adoption of new a technology may feature excess inertia because of in
complete information about the preferences of future potential adopters. Even a slight

probability that future users are conservative and therefore are better o® not adopting the

new technology, can act as a deterrent for early users that would prefer the new technology.

On the other hand, excess momentum may appear when sticking to the old technology

is not a dominant strategy. That is, if initial users prefer the new technology, future users


49The New York Times Magazine, May 5, 1996.


82


will also choose the new technology, despite the fact that the utility from sticking to the

old technolgy if the initial users were also conservative, is much higher (see the example in

section 17.3).


17.8 Company A has just developed a new technology. Company B approaches

Company A, stating it has developed its own version of the technology and proposing

a compromise that would make the two technologies compatible with each other.

What advice would you give Company A?


Solution: If the ¯rms decide to go alone, standards competition reduces the product
market size for both of them, and they may end up loosing, since users have the easy option

of staying with the old technology (see the example in box 17.3). Therefore, compatibility

is the prefered action.

On the other hand, if product competition is ¯erce when the products are compatible,

then the two ¯rms will get duopoly pro¯ts which are lower than the expectation of prof
its from refusing the compromise (case in which each ¯rm receives monopoly pro¯ts with

probability 0.5). In this case, the decission to go alone is better.


17.9 A standardization battle is currently under way in the recordable DVD

industry, with Philips and Sony on one side, Matsushita and Toshiba on the other

side. In an e®ort to coordinate on a standard, an industry group was set up: the DVD

Forum. On April 1997, the forum's ten members voted eight-to-two to standardize

around the Matsushita-backed format, leaving Philips and Sony stranded with their

losing format. Within a few weeks, Philips and Sony announced they would start

selling their own format.

What role can you see for public policy in this case?


Solution: A standardization war can have as an e®ect a delay in the introduction of a

product, which is bad both for the consumers and producers. Hence, there is scope for

public policy in settling the issue of which standard should be chosen. On the other hand,

the cost of having only one standard is lower product variety and lower competition. Public

policy has to weigh which e®ect is more important from the point of view of social welfare.


17.10 [¤] You are marketing a new wireless information device (WID). Consumers

di®er in their willingness to pay for the device. (No one needs more than one.)

All consumers value owning a WID more highly, the larger is the total number of

consumers using such devices. Denote the expected total number of WID users by

n [e], which we also can call the \expected size of the WID network."


83


If all consumers expect the size of the WID network to be n [e], and the price of

the device is p, then the number of users who will want to buy the device (i.e., the

total quantity demanded) is given by n = 100 ¡ p + vn [e], where 0 < v < 1. (Note

that this is a standard linear relationship between price and unit sales for any given

level of expected network size, n [e] .)

(a) Interpret the parameter v. What factors in°uence v?

Suppose that your marginal cost per WID is 20. Suppose also that consumers

are quite sophisticated and form accurate expectations about the size of the WID

network, for any price p that you might set, so that n must equal n [e] .

(b) What is the pro¯t-maximizing price of WIDs? How many are sold, and what

pro¯ts do you earn?

Suppose that you could improve the performance of your WID communications

network and thus enhance the network e®ects, raising v from 1/3 to 1/2.

(c) How much would you pay to develop this enhancement?


Solution:


(a) The parameter v is the network bene¯t contributed by each additional WID sold. One way

to think about this is as follows. When an additional WID is sold, n [e] increases by one. This

raises the bene¯t to all consumers from owning a WID since now there is one more WID

out there with which they might communicate. Adding up this small improvement in the

value of a WID for all consumers gives us the parameter v.

Suppose that your marginal cost per WID is 20. Suppose also that consumers are quite

sophisticated and form accurate expectations about the size of the WID network, for any

price p that you might set.


(b) Since consumers have accurate expectations we can set n [e] equal to n and invert the total

demand for WIDs to get p = 100 ¡ (1 ¡ v)n as the inverse demand curve and a marginal
revenue curve of MR = 100 ¡ 2(1 ¡ v)n. The optimal number of WIDs to sell is that
which equates this marginal revenue with marginal cost. That is, 100 ¡ 2(1 ¡ v)n = 20 or
n = (80)=2(1 ¡ v). The pro¯t maximizing price is then p = 100 ¡ (1 ¡ v)(80)=2(1 ¡ v) = 60
and pro¯ts are (60 ¡ 20)80=2(1 ¡ v) = 1600=(1 ¡ v).


(c) When v = 1=3, the ¯rm's pro¯ts are 1600=(1 ¡ :333) = $2; 400. When v = 1=2, the ¯rm's
pro¯ts are 1600=(1 ¡ :5) = $3; 200. Therefore, the most the ¯rm would pay to develop this
enhancement is $3,200-$2,400=$800.


17.11 [¤] Two ¯rms, Compress and Squeeze, o®er incompatible software products

that encrypt and shrink the size of large data ¯les for safe storage and/or faster

transmission. This software category exhibits strong network e®ects, since users seek

to send ¯les to each other, and a ¯le saved in one format cannot be retrieved using

the other format. The marginal cost of serving one customer is $40 for either ¯rm.

To keep things simple, suppose that there are only two customers, \Pioneer"

and \Follower," and two time periods, \This Year" and \Next Year." As the name


84


suggests, Pioneer moves ¯rst, picking one format This Year. Pioneer cannot change

her choice once it is made. In contrast, Follower picks Next Year. Follower will be

aware of Pioneer's pick when the time comes for Follower to pick. The annual interest

rate is 20% for both Compress and Squeeze and Pioneer.

Pioneer regards Compress and Squeeze as equally attractive products. Pioneer

values either product at $100 during This Year (before Follower enters the market),

and at $100 during Next Year if Follower does not pick the same product. If Follower

does pick the same product Next Year, Pioneer's value during Next Year will be $136.

(In other words, the network e®ect is worth $36 to Pioneer.)

Follower has very similar preferences. If Follower picks the same product Next

Year as Pioneer did This Year, Follower values that product at $136. Alternatively,

if Follower picks a di®erent product Next Year than Pioneer did This Year, the value

to Follower of that product will be only $100.

Finally, suppose that Compress and Squeeze simultaneously set prices This Year

at which they o®er their products to Pioneer. (One could just as well say that they

bid for Pioneer's business.) Then Compress and Squeeze simultaneously set prices

Next Year at which they will o®er their products to Follower.

For simplicity, please assume that Pioneer will pick Compress if Pioneer is just

indi®erent between Compress and Squeeze, and that Follower will pick the same

product as Pioneer if Follower is indi®erent between Compress and Squeeze given the

values they o®er and the prices they charge.

(a) What prices will Compress and Squeeze set Next Year in bidding to win

Follower's business if Compress wins Pioneer's business This Year?

(b) What prices will Compress and Squeeze set This Year in bidding to win

Pioneer's business?

(c) What product will Pioneer buy, and what product will Follower buy?

(d) What are the resulting payo®s of Compress, Squeeze, Pioneer, and Follower?

(e) Describe in words the advantages of early or late adopters identi¯ed in this

problem.

(f) How does all of this change if there is rapid technological progress so that

costs Next Year are much lower than costs This Year?

(g) How does your analysis change if the (marginal) cost of serving a customer is

only 20 rather than 40?


Solution:


(a) If Compress wins during the ¯rst period, then Compress o®ers an extra $36 value over
Squeeze to Follower. Squeeze will compete as best possible by o®ering its product at cost,
$40, but Compress can win by charging $76. (We could make this $75.95, but the numbers
are simpli¯ed by breaking ties in favor of Compress.)


(b) The equilibrium derived in A generates pro¯ts Next Year to Compress of $36, which are
equal to $30 in This Year dollars (given the 20% interest rate). By symmetry, Squeeze
would also enjoy pro¯ts of $36 Next Year if Pioneer picks Squeeze this year. This implies
that both Compress and Squeeze are prepared to set a price as low as $10 to win Pioneer's
business: losing Pioneer's business means they will lose Follower's business as well and earn


85


zero; bidding $10 means losing $30 This Year and earning pro¯ts of $36 Next Year, which

gives zero in present discounted value.


(c) From the answer to B, we conclude that the Nash Equilibrium involves a bid of $10 by

each ¯rm to serve Pioneer. Compress thus will win Pioneer's business, by our tie-breaking

convention. Then Squeeze will bid $40 to serve Follower, and Compress will bid $76 to serve

Follower. Compress will win, so both customers will buy from Compress.


(d) Both ¯rms earn zero pro¯ts in present discounted value. All of the pro¯ts are dissipated by

bidding for Pioneer's business, since Pioneer \tips" the market towards one product or the

other. Pioneer gets a surplus of $90 This Year and $136 Next Year. Follower gets surplus

of $60 Next Year.


(e) Pioneer enjoys a nice strategic advantage by virtue of its ability to \tip" the market, i.e., to

in°uence subsequent adopters.


(f) With rapid technological progress, prices fall rapidly and Follower could well do better than

Pioneer, simply because Follower can buy when the product is much cheaper to produce

(or of higher quality). From the customer's perspective, waiting for products to improve

must be balanced against the bene¯ts of adopting early and thus enjoying very strong price

competition between incompatible suppliers seeking to build their installed bases and thus

gain competitive advantage.


(g) If marginal costs are only $20, then the price during This Year would be -$10. The problem

here is that many \phantom" customers could appear, take the $10 subsidy to use the

product, and then disappear. Actually paying customers to take your product can be a very

dangerous strategy. Are you building an installed base of users or just giving away money

to opportunistic \fake" customers?


17.12 [¤] Technological progress (of a sort) has led to the WalkDVD. As the name

suggests, this is a miniature DVD player. It is attached to a pair of headphones and

special viewing glasses which, together, allow for highly realistic sound and image

e®ects, as well as easy mobility. Three ¯rms, Son, Tosh and Phil, are planning to

launch their WalkDVD players. There are two possible formats to choose from, S

and T, and the three competitors have not agreed on which standard to adopt. Son

prefers standard S, whereas Tosh prefers standard T. Phil does not have any strong

preference other than being compatible with the other ¯rms. Speci¯cally, the payo®s

for each player as a function of the standard they adopt and the number of ¯rms that

adopt the same standard are given by Table 2. For example, the value 200 in the Son

row and S2 column means that if Son chooses the S standard and two ¯rms choose

the S standard, then Son's payo® is 200.

Suppose that all three ¯rms simultaneously choose which standard to adopt.

(a) Show that \all ¯rms choosing S" and \all ¯rms choosing T" are both Nash

equilibria of this game.

(b) Determine whether there are any other Nash equilibria in this simultaneous
move game.

Son has just acquired a ¯rm that manufactures DVDs for the S format. For all

practical purposes, this implies that Son is committed to the S format. It is now up

to Tosh and Phil to simultaneously decide which format to choose.

(c) Write down the 2x2 payo® matrix for the game now played by Tosh and Phil.

Find the Nash equilibrium of this game.

(d) Do you think Son's move was a good one? How would your answer di®er if

Phil had a slight preference for the T format (e.g., assume that payo®s for T1, T2

and T3 are 70, 110 and 130, respectively)?

Suppose now that all ¯rms' payo®s are like Phil in the table above. You are Son.

(e) If you could choose, would you rather move before Tosh and Phil, or after

them? Contrast your answer to what you have learned from the answers to parts (c)

and (d).


Solution:


(a) Suppose all ¯rms choose S. By unilaterally deviating and choosing T instead, Son would get

40 instead of 250; Tosh would get 100 instead of 110; and Phil would get 60 instead of 120.

Since all would stand to lose, we conclude that all with S constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

By the same token, all choosing T is also a Nash equilibrium.


(b) The only other possible (pure-strategy) Nash equilibria are for two ¯rms to choose one

standard and one to choose the other one. But such a situation cannot be a Nash equilibrium:

the ¯rm that is the sole adopter of one of the standards would be better o® by joining the

other ¯rms. We conclude that there are no (pure-strategy) Nash equilibria in addition to

the ones derived in the previous question.

Son has just acquired a ¯rm that manufactures DVDs for the S format. For all practical

purposes, this implies that Son is committed to the S format. It is now up to Tosh and Phil

to simultaneously decide which format to choose.


(c) The game is as follows:


87


Phil

|Col1|S|T|
|---|---|---|
|S|120<br>110|60<br>80|
|T|100<br>100|100<br>200|



Notice that Phil has a (weakly) dominant strategy: to choose S. Even if Phil assigns

the lowest positive probability that Tosh is going along with S, it is strictly better o® (in

expected value) by choosing S. Knowing this, Tosh should choose S, since, conditional on

Phil choosing S, payo® is greater with S (110) than with T (100). We conclude that both

¯rms choose S.

Notice that (T,T) is also a Nash equilibrium. However, the discussion above implies that

it would not be a very \reasonable" Nash equilibrium.


(d) Son's move was a brilliant one. In the simultaneous-move game, there are two Nash equilib
ria, one that is good for Son, one that is not so good. By moving ahead of the other players,

Son is e®ectively able to lead the industry to adopt its preferred standard.

In the event Phil prefers the T standard, things are di®erent. The game played between

Tosh and Phil is now the following


Phil

|Col1|S|T|
|---|---|---|
|S|120<br>110|70<br>80|
|T|100<br>100|110<br>200|



There are now two Nash equilibria: (S,S) and (T,T). Moreover, joint payo® are greater

in the (T,T) equilibrium (310) than in the (S,S) equilibrium (230). It is not unlikely that

Tosh and Phil choose T, in which case Son is worse o® by choosing S than by choosing T

as well.

Suppose now that all ¯rms' payo®s are like Phil in the table above. You are Son.


(e) If all ¯rms have payo®s as Phil, then a particular ¯rm would prefer to move after the other

¯rms have moved than to move at the same time. As in part A, there are two Nash equilibria

in the simultaneous-move game. Moreover, both equilibria yield each ¯rm the same payo®.

If ¯rms are able to coordinate perfectly on which equilibrium to choose, then moving at

the same time or after does not make a di®erence. If however there is a small chance that

coordination will fail, then moving later is (weakly) better, as it reduces the probability of

mis-coordination.

17.13 [¤¤¤] Consider the market for a given piece of hardware |a photocopier

of brand x, for example| that needs after-sale servicing. Suppose that there is free

entry into this after market. Servicing photocopiers implies a ¯xed cost of · and a

marginal cost of ° per unit of service provided. Total demand for servicing is given
by D = ¾(® ¡ p), where p is price and ¾ the number of photocopier owners. Finally,
suppose that ¯rms in the after market compete µa la Cournot.

This is a case of indirect network externalities. The greater the market size (S), the
greater the need for after-sale services, and hence the greater competition in the after-sale

market. This increase in competition lowers the price for after-sale services and increases

consumer surplus.
