the part of the period they would ideally like to make their purchase. One half the

buyers would prefer to purchase during the ¯rst part of the period, one half during

the second part. A buyer of type i is willing to pay ~~v~~ i for a purchase during his or
her preferred part of the period; and v ~~i~~ for a purchase at another time.
Buyers of type 1, which constitute a fraction ® of the population, are highvaluation, impatient buyers; that is, ~~v~~ h is very high and v ~~h~~ very low. High valuation
implies that ~~v~~ h is very high; impatience implies that v ~~h~~ is very low: buyers of type 1
are not willing to buy at any time other than their preferred time. Buyers of type 2,
by contrast, are very patient: ~~v~~ l ¼ v ~~l~~ . Assume that ® is relatively low; speci¯cally,
® < ~~v~~ l ~~=v~~ h. To summarize: ~~v~~ h > ~~v~~ l ¼ v ~~l~~ - ® ~~v~~ h > v ~~h~~ ¼ 0.
a) Show that, under a constant-price strategy, the seller optimally sets p = ~~v~~ l.
b) Determine ¯rm pro¯ts when it sets prices p = ~~v~~ h and p = vl in the ¯rst and
second parts of the period, respectively.

c) Show that pro¯ts are greater under the \sales" strategy.



Solution: a) If p > ~~v~~ 1 ~~,~~ then there is no sale. If ~~v~~ 2 < p < ~~v~~ 1, then the only purchasers
are the impatient, high-valuation buyers, and the seller's pro¯t is ¼ = ®p, with maximum

maximum value ~~v~~ 2 ~~.~~ Since ® ~~v~~ 1 < ~~v~~ 2 ~~,~~ it is clear that the best constant-price strategy is to set
p = ~~v~~ 2.

11.1 [¤] Assume for the purposes of this problem that, contrary to their protesta
tions, Microsoft has a monopoly in providing operating systems, called \Windows,"

for personal computers. Assume also that the marginal cost to Microsoft of supplying

its operating system for one more computer is zero. Denote by w the price charged

by Microsoft for its operating system. (Assume that Microsoft sets a single price per

computer, i.e., does not employ two-part tari®s, quantity discounts, or other forms

of price discrimination.)

Computer Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) assemble computers. Sup
pose that the \bill of materials" for a computer, i.e., the cost to the OEM of all the

parts necessary to build a computer, adds up to $900 per machine, and that assem
bly costs another $100 per machine. Finally, assume (contrary to the e®orts of Dell

and Compaq) that computers are a homogeneous good and the annual demand for

computers is given by Q = 50; 000; 000 ¡ 10; 000 p, where Q is quantity and p is price

as usual.

Suppose that the OEM business is perfectly competitive.

(a) For any given price, w, of operating systems, what will be the price and sales

of computers?

(b) What price w should Microsoft set for its operating system? How much money

will Microsoft make? How much money will OEMs make? What will be the price of

a computer?


51


Amusing if irrelevant note: Microsoft in fact charges in the $50 to $60 range per

PC for Windows98. Microsoft argued in their antitrust trial that they must not really

have a monopoly or else they would be charging a lot more.

(c) How much money would a vertically integrated ¯rm controlling both the

supply of Windows and the assembly of computers make? What price would such a

¯rm charge for computers?

(d) Could Microsoft make more money by integrating downstream into computer

assembly? Why or why not?

Suppose now (de¯nitely contrary to reality) that a single ¯rm, Compaq, has a

monopoly over the assembly of computers.

(e) For a given price, w, for Windows, what price, p, would Compaq set for

computers and how many computers would be sold?

(f) What price, w, should Microsoft set for its operating system? How much

money will Microsoft make? How much money will Compaq make? What will be the

price of a computer?

(g) Could Microsoft and Compaq make more money by merging? If so, how

much? Would such a merger bene¯t or harm computer users? By how much?


Solution:


(a) Competition in the downstream computer market will drive prices in that market to the
OEM's marginal cost. For the downstream computer makers, marginal cost is equal to w
the price they pay Microsoft for its operating system plus the 900+100 = 1000 per machine
that they incur in materials and assembly. Therefore, the price in the downstream market
will be p = w + 1000 and the total number of computers sold will be Q = 50; 000; 000 ¡
10; 000(w + 1; 000) = 40; 000; 000 ¡ 10; 000w.


(b) The demand curve calculated in part (a) is the derived demand for Microsoft's operating system since each computer sold has one copy of the Microsoft's operating system. Therefore, the correct price for Microsoft to charge is the price that maximizes
its pro¯ts in this market, which is the monopoly price. Inverting this demand curve
you get w = 4000 ¡ Q=10000, which means that Microsoft's marginal revenue will be
MR M = 4000 ¡ Q=5000. Since its marginal cost for the operating system is zero, the
optimal quantity to sell will be 4000 ¡ Q=5000 = 0 or Q = 20; 000; 000 machines, or 20
million copies of its operating software. In order to sell this many copies, Microsoft needs
to set its price, w such that w = 4000 ¡ 20; 000; 000=10000 = 2; 000. At this price, Microsoft
earns $2000 ¢ 20; 000; 000 = $40; 000; 000; 000 in pro¯ts. The OEMs earn zero pro¯ts since
they price at marginal cost, which is equal to $2; 000 + $100 + 900 = $3; 000.


(c) A vertically integrated ¯rm has marginal costs of is $0 for the operating system, $100 for
assembly, and $900 for computer parts. Assuming that the vertically integrated ¯rm only
sells operating systems to its downstream computer subsidiary, this subsidiary would be
a monopolist in the computer market. Therefore, its marginal revenue would be MR =
5000 ¡ Q=5000. Setting this marginal revenue equal to marginal cost of $1000 and solving
for Q [¤] yields Q [¤] = 20; 000; 000 units. In order to sell this many units the ¯rm would charge


52


p = 5000 ¡ 20; 000; 000=10000 = 5000 ¡ 2000 = $3; 000 per computer. Its pro¯ts would be
20; 000; 000($3000 ¡ $1000) = $40; 000; 000; 000.


(d) Since all the market power in this industry is in the software business, Microsoft can make
just as much money by staying in the upstream market as it could by entering the downstream market. You just demonstrated that fact in part (c).


(e) As a monopolist in the downstream market, Compaq faces marginal revenue equal to MR =
5000 ¡ Q=5000. Equating this with its marginal cost of w + 1000 and solving for Q [¤] yields,
Q [¤] = 20; 000; 000 ¡ 5000w. This is the optimal amount for Compaq to sell, which requires
a price of p = 5000 ¡ (20; 000; 000 ¡ 5000w)=10000 = 3000 + w=2.


(f) When setting its price, w, Microsoft knows that its demand will we Q [¤] = 20; 000; 000; ¡5000w
since this is the optimal amount for Compaq to sell when it pays Microsoft a price of w per
unit of the operating system. For Microsoft, the optimal number of units of the operating
system to sell are those that maximize its pro¯ts given this demand. Inverting Q [¤] and
solving for w yields w = 4000 ¡ Q [¤] =5000, which means that Microsoft's marginal revenue
is MR = 5000 ¡ Q [¤] =2500. Equating this with its marginal cost of zero, you ¯nd that the
optimal amount for Microsoft to sell is Q [¤] = 12; 500; 000 units. In order to sell this many
units, Microsoft's price to Compaq needs to be w = 4000 ¡ 12; 500; 000=5000 = $1500 per
unit. Its pro¯ts will be 12; 500; 000$1500 = $18; 750; 000; 000.


(g) If Microsoft and Compaq merged, their pro¯ts would be those calculated for the integrated
computer maker calculated above (Part (c)), or $40,000,000,000, which is an improvement
of $21,250,000,000. Consumers actually bene¯t as well since the total number of computers
they buy will increase form 12,500,000 to 20,000,000 and the price they pay will fall. The
total improvement for consumer is equal to the change in consumer surplus associated with
the expansion of the number of computers sold and this price decline. In the vertically separated setting, the total cost of a computer is p = 1500=2+3000 = 3750 (from Part (e) above).
Therefore, the consumer surplus is equal to (12; 500; 000)(5000¡3750)=2 = $7; 812; 500; 000.
In the vertically integrated setting, the price of a computer is $3,000 (from Part (b) above)
so the consumer surplus will be (20; 000; 000)(5000¡3000)=2 = $20; 000; 000; 000. Therefore,
the net improvement in consumer welfare will be $12,187,500,000.


11.2 Empirical evidence suggests that franchiser-owned McDonald's restaurants

charge lower prices than independent ones. How can this di®erence be explained?


Solution: This is an example of double marginalization. If ¯rms are vertically integrated

(as is the case with franchise-owned McDonalds restaurants), then the retailer price is the

monopoly price for the vertical structure. On the other hand, if the ¯rms are not vertically

integrated, then retailer's pro¯t maximization leads to a second monopoly margin which

takes as marginal cost the wholesale price. If the wholesale price is equal to the marginal

cost of the upstream ¯rm, then the two retail prices are the same. However, in such a


53


case the upstream ¯rm makes zero pro¯ts. We would thus expect the wholesale price to be

greater than marginal cost. It follows that the retail price for independent retailers is higher

than for franchise-owned retailers.


11.3 Suppose that a manufacturer sells to n retailers by means of a two-part

tari® (f; w) including a ¯x fee f and a wholesale price w. Explain the intuition of

the result that the greater the degree of retailer competition, the greater the optimal

wholesale price.


Solution: See Section 11.2.


11.4 The following industries are known to practice or have practiced resale

price maintenance: fashion clothing, consumer electronics, ¯ne fragrances. In each

case, indicate the probable motivation for RPM and the likely welfare consequences.


Solution: In the case of consumer electronics, as pointed out in Section 11.3, there is

an important positive externality from investing in sales e®ort. Retailers can free-ride on

the investment e®orts made by competing retailers, since one consumer can bene¯t from

the point-of-sale services provided by a retailer (who invested in sales e®ort) and shop at

a lower-price retailer (who did not invest). The result of this externality is that no retailer

invests and the demand for the good is lower. An RPM policy induces investment in sales

e®ort (which increases demand); instead of competing in price (which is now the minimum

price required by the manufacturer), the retailers compete in investments in sales e®ort to

attract customers. The ¯nal bene¯ciaries of this policy are, obviously, the retailers and the

manufacturer. Nevertheless, consumers also bene¯t from better services at the point of sale.

in the fashion clothing and ¯ne fragrance industries the degree of externality is likely

to be much lower. Still, the incentives to invest may not high enough, since the retailer's

bene¯t from investing in e®ort sales depends on the margin it receives. Speci¯cally, if the

margin is low, then the retailer will invest a small amount. Using an RPM policy, the

manufacturer can create a larger margin for the retailer, thus inducing the optimal level of

investment (see Section 11.4).


11.5 Vermont Castings is a manufacturer of wood-burning stoves, a somewhat

complex product. One of Vermont Castings's dealers once complained about the

terms of the relations between the manufacturer and dealers, stating that \the worst

disappointment is spending a great deal of time with a customer only to lose him to

Applewood [a competing retailer] because of price." Speci¯cally, the dealer lamented


54


\the loss of 3 sales of V.C. stoves . . . to people whom we educated and spent long
hours with." [2][9]


How do you think this problem can be resolved? How would you defend your

solution in an antitrust/competition policy court?


Solution: Obviously, this is a case when one retailer makes an investment in sales e®ort

while the other free-rides and gets the customer by charging a lower price. As we have seen

in the discussions in sections 11.2 and 11.3, one possible solution to this problem is to use

an RPM policy. In this way, the price would be \¯xed" at the minimum level, while the

retailers would compete in sales e®orts to attract customers.

One would expect that the minimum price set in the RPM policy would be high, hence,

an antitrust court would not agree with this policy. However, Vermont Casting may argue

that, absent the RPM policy, the retailers will have no incentives to further invest in sales

e®ort and to provide services to customers, making them (the customers) worse o®. The price

may be lower but the services may be poor. On the contrary, by using an RPM policy, the

price may indeed increase, but the customer will now bene¯t from proper services provided

at the point of sale. Obviously there is a trade-o® between using and not using an RPM

policy, with the crucial issue being the level at which the minimum price should be set.


11.6 Should the European Union outlaw the practice of exclusive territories in

car dealerships? Why or why not?


Solution: As we saw in Section 11.3 exclusive territories represent an instance of vertical

restraints that helps in resolving the inter-retailer externality represented by underinvest
ment in sales e®ort. Thus, if awarded an exclusive territory, a car dealer has all the incentives

to invest in advertising, educating customers, etc., while absent this policy it would, most

likely, underprovide these services. The issue is to quantify the positive and negative e®ects

of such a policy, that is, to observe how prices and service levels are set in areas where this

policy is in use compared to areas where it is not.


11.7 Beer producers are wont to impose an exclusive dealing clause on retailers.

Discuss the e±ciency and market power e®ects of this practice.


Solution: Exclusive dealing has, obviously, the e®ect of foreclosing upstream competition,

that is, competition between manufacturers, which, a discussed in Sections 11.5 and 11.6, is

likely to reduce welfare and increase market power. One possible defense of exclusive dealing


29Cf Judge R Posner's opinion, cited


Mathewson, Frank, and Ralph Winter (1998), \The Law and Economics of Resale Price Maintenance,"
Review of Industrial Organization 13, 57{84..


55


is that there may be important investments to be made by the manufacturer at the retail

store, so that, if there is competition between manufacturers, an externality may appear,

leading to sub-optimal investments. In the case of car dealerships, such externality arise in

the context of dealer training to be done by the manufactuer. In the case of beer, however,

it is unlikely there are signi¯cant manufacturer externalities.


11.8 [¤] Two major music companies|Sony and Warner Music|have recently

been subject to an antitrust inquiry by the FTC over allegations that they illegally

discouraged retail discounting of compact disks. The investigation is centered on the

practice of announcing suggested prices. Suggested prices are not illegal|only agree
ments among ¯rms on such prices are illegal. But in practice retailers that advertise

or promote CDs at a price below the suggested price are denied cash payments by
the manufacturers, in e®ect \forcing" such suggested prices. [3][0]


How would you decide on this case?


Solution: De facto, this situation corresponds to one of RPM, even though it is not

explicitly presented as such. The analysis of the costs and bene¯ts from RPM should

therefore be applied.


11.9 [¤¤¤] Consider the model presented in the beginning of Section ??, but assume

that retailers compete µa la Cournot. Show that the optimal wholesale price is strictly

between marginal cost and monopoly price.



Solution: As in the text, suppose that the upstream ¯rm o®ers retailers a contract

stipulating a ¯xed fee, f, as well as a wholesale price, w. From Chapter ??, we know that
the equilibrium price under Cournot competition is given by p [N] = [1] 3 [a][ +] [2] 3 [w][, where][ w][ is the]

e®ective marginal cost paid by retailers. Output per ¯rm is given by q [N] = [1] 2 [(][a][ ¡][ p][N] [) =]

(a ¡ w)=3. Finally, equilibrium pro¯t per ¯rm is ¼ [R] = (a ¡ w) [2] =3. This implies that the
upstream ¯rm can ask for as much as f = (a ¡ w) [2] =3 as a ¯xed fee.

The upstream ¯rm's total pro¯t is therefore given by

Maximizing with respect to w, we get the optimal value w = [1]

Maximizing with respect to w, we get the optimal value w = 4 [a][ +] 4 [c][. Notice that the]

optimal w is a convex combination of a and c, that is, the coe±cients of a and c add up to
1. Moreover, from Chapter ?? we know that monopoly pro¯t is given by p [M] = [1] 2 [a][ +] [1] 2 [c][.]

Since the relative weight of w on c is greater than the weight of p [M] on c (and c < a), it
follows that w is less than monopoly price. By the same argument, it is also clear that w is
greater than marginal cost.

11.10 [¤¤¤] Consider the following highly simpli¯ed picture of the personal com
puter industry.

There are many, price-taking ¯rms that assemble computer systems. Call these

¯rms \computer OEMs." (\OEMs" stands for \original equipment manufacturers.")

Each of these ¯rms must buy three inputs for each computer system that it sells: (1)

a variety of components that are themselves supplied competitively and collectively

cost the computer OEM $500 per computer; (2) the Windows operating system, available only from Microsoft, at a price pM, to be discussed below; and (3) a Pentium
microprocessor, available only from Intel, at a price pI, also to be discussed below.
Since each computer system requires precisely one operating system and one microprocessor, the marginal cost of a computer to an OEM is 500+ pM + pI . Assume that
competition among OEMs drives the price of a computer system down to marginal
cost, so we have p = 500 + pM + pI, where p is the price of a computer system.
The demand for computer systems is given by Q = 100; 000; 000 ¡ 50; 000p.
Microsoft is the sole supplier of the Windows operating system for personal com
puters. The marginal cost to Microsoft of providing Windows for one more computer

is zero.

Intel is the sole supplier of the Pentium microprocessors for personal computers.

The marginal cost to Intel of a Pentium microprocessor for one more computer system

is $300.

(a) Suppose that Microsoft and Intel simultaneously and independently set the
prices for Windows and Pentium chips, pM and pI . What are the Nash equilibrium
prices, ^pM and ^pI ?
Now suppose that Microsoft and Intel sit down to negotiate an agreement to sell

Windows and Pentium chips as a package to computer OEMs for a package price of
pMI .
(b) What package price would maximize Microsoft's and Intel's combined pro¯ts?

By how much would an agreement between Microsoft and Intel boost their combined

pro¯ts?

(c) Would ¯nal consumers bene¯t from such an agreement between Microsoft

and Intel, or would they be harmed? What about computer OEMs? Relate your

answer to your calculations in parts (a) and (b), and explain the economic principles

underlying your answer.


Solution: [(a)] First consider Microsoft's best response to any given price pI by Intel.
Using the underlying demand for computers, the demand for Windows is given by Q =
100; 000; 000 ¡ 50; 000(500 + pM + pI ). For a given value of pI, the demand for Windows is
Q = 75; 000; 000 ¡ 50; 000pI ¡ 50; 000pM . The corresponding marginal revenue for Microsoft
is MR M = 1500 ¡ pI ¡ Q=25; 000. Setting this equal to Microsoft's marginal cost of zero
gives qM [¤] [= 37][;][ 500][;][ 000][¡][25][;][ 000][p][I] [, and the corresponding optimal price of][ p] M [¤] [= 750][¡][p][I] [=][2.]
Next, repeat these steps to consider Intel's best response to any given price pM by Microsoft.
The only di®erence is that Intel has a marginal cost of $300. These calculations imply that
MR I = 1500 ¡ pM ¡ Q=25; 000. Setting this equal to Intel's marginal cost of $300 gives
with the corresponding optimal price of p [¤] I [= 900] [¡] [p][M] [=][2. Finally, solve these two equations]
together to get the Nash Equilibrium prices, which are p [¤] M [= $400 and][ p] I [¤] [= $700. Note]


57


that the resulting price of a computer is $1600, so total computer sales are 20 million.

[(b)] This is a basic monopoly pricing problem for Microsoft and Intel collectively. If
they set a package price of pMI, the price of a computer system will be 500 + pMI . The
number of computers sold will be Q = 100; 000; 000 ¡ 50; 000(500 + pMI ). The marginal

¡
revenue corresponding to this demand curve is MR MI = 1500 Q=25; 000. Setting this
equal to the (combined) marginal cost of $300 gives a quantity of Q [¤] MI [= 30][;][ 000][;][ 000]
and a corresponding package price of p [¤] MI [= $900.] At this price, the contribution to
Microsoft's and Intel's combined pro¯ts is $600 per computer times 30 million machines, or
$18 billion. In comparison, the Nash Equilibrium in part (a) involved a contribution of $800
per computer times 20 million machines, or $16 billion. Cutting a deal is worth $2 billion
to Microsoft and Intel together.

[(c)] Since Windows and Pentium are complements, Microsoft's pro¯ts are decreasing in
the price of Pentium chips, and Intel's prices are decreasing in the price set by Microsoft.
This implies that the two companies together would bene¯t from lower prices than they
would set separately. Indeed, comparing parts (a) and (b) we see a lower price in part (b)
than in part (a). Final consumers thus bene¯t from the cooperation between Microsoft and
Intel. OEMs are indi®erent, because their pro¯ts are driven to zero by competition, whatever
the prices of components. (In practice, OEMs would bene¯t in the short run from the lower
input prices, and OEMs able to di®erentiate themselves with their own brand names would
bene¯t for a longer period of time.) The underlying principle is that cooperation among
suppliers of complements tends to bene¯t consumers, just as cooperation among suppliers of
substitutes (i.e., collusion) harms consumers. This is closely related to the theory of \double
marginalization" that we discussed in this chapter; the only di®erence is that Microsoft and
Intel stand in a \complements" relationship rather than a buyer/seller relationship.


12.2 Empirical evidence suggests that, during the 1970s, a ¯rm with an IBM

1400 was as likely as any other ¯rm to purchase an IBM when making a new purchase,

while a ¯rm with an IBM 360 was more likely to purchase an IBM than a ¯rm that

did not own an IBM 360. Software for the IBM 1400 could not run on the succeeding

generations of IBM models (360, 370, 3000, and 4300), while software for the IBM
360 could run on the 370, 3000 and 4300. [3][1]


How do you interpret these results?


Solution: These results suggest how backwards compatibility in°uences the degree of

switching cost. Switching away from an IBM 1400 was less costly because there was no

backwards compatibility between later models and the software developed for the IBM 1400.

The same was not thue for the 360,370, 3000 and 4300 models. Consumers who bought one

of these models had a higher opportunity cost of switching to a non-IBM computer. As

Greenstein, Shane M. (1993), \Did Installed Base Give an Incumbent Any (Measurable) Advantages in

Federal Computer Procurement?," Rand Journal of Economics 24, 19{39..


58


we would expect, these consumers were more likely to buy IBM in the future than other

consumers.


12.3 Says a market analyst in Brussels:


I think the euro [the new European single currency] will bring lower prices

over all but that the price di®erences will be more or less the ones we have

right now.


Do you agree? Why or why not?


Solution: As discussed in Section 12.4, there is signi¯cant price dispersion across European

countries. Cross-country di®erences are partly due to price discrimination, partly to taxation

and regulation, and partly to search costs (and possibly other factors). Search costs may be

reduced because consumers are no longer confused by transforming prices from one currency

to another. Therefore, the reduction in search costs should reduce the market power of ¯rms

(perhaps not to a great extent, though), resulting in lower prices. Overall di®erences will,

however, persist, due to the above mentioned price discrimination, taxes, regulations, etc.


12.4 A study on retail price for books and CDs ¯nds that price dispersion

(weighted by market shares) is lower for internet retailers than for conventional retailers. [3][2] Discuss.


Solution: Lower price dispersion may result from two factors. First, it is easier to

obtain information about online store prices than it is about conventional retailers. Second,

online stores have one less dimension of di®erntiation with respect to traditional stores:

geographical location.

As shown in Section 12.4, imperfect information leads to higher prices and possible price

dispersion. In Section 12.2, we argued that product di®erentiation leads to higher prices.

And, although this was not formally shown, product di®erentiation may also lead to price

dispersion.

In summary, lower price dispersion by online sellers may result both from imperfect

information and product di®erentiation. In fact, one of the points of this chapter is that

the e®ects of imperfect information and product di®erentiation are often similar.

59


12.5 \Price dispersion is a manifestation | and indeed it is a measure |
of ignorance in the market." [33] Do you agree? Compare with possible alternative

explanations for price dispersion.


Solution: If we consider search costs as being a measure of market ignorance, then indeed

the above claim holds. As in note f) in section 12.4, quotation of prices in di®erent currencies

makes comparison shopping more di±cult by increasing \search costs". The fact that buyers

do not know or bother to learn how to transform prices from one currency into another is

a sign of ignorance, which supports price dispersion.

Other alternative explanations for price dispersion may be: price discrimination, dif
ferent regulatory or taxation regimes (geographical price dispersion) or di®erent shopping

experience (see the example for CDs bought in a small music shop or in a supermarket).


12.6 Consider the model of price dispersion sketched in Section ??. Show that

there can be at most two di®erent prices in equilibrium.


Solution: See S. Salop and J. Stiglitz, \Bargains and Ripo®s," Review of Economic Studies

44 (1976), 493{510; or the summary discussion in H. Varian, Microeconomic Analysis, New

York: Norton (1978), Chapter 8.


12.7 [¤] Two ¯rms are engaged in Bertrand competition. There are 10,000 people

in the population, each of whom is willing to pay at most 10 for at most one unit

of the good. Both ¯rms have a constant marginal cost of 5. Currently, each ¯rm is

allocated half the market. It costs a customer s to switch from one ¯rm to the other.

Customers know what prices are being charged. Law or custom restricts the ¯rms to

charging whole-dollar amounts (e.g., they can charge 6, but not 6.50).

(a) Suppose that s = 0. What are the Nash equilibria of this model? Why does

discrete (whole-dollar) pricing result in more equilibria than continuous pricing?

(b) Suppose that s = 2. What is (are) the Nash equilibrium (equilibria) of this

model?

(c) Suppose that s = 4. What is (are) the Nash equilibrium (equilibria) of this

model?

(d) Comparing the expected pro¯ts in (b) to those in (c), what is the value of

raising customers' switching costs from 2 to 4?


Solution:


33


Stigler, George (1961), \The Economics of Information," Journal of Political Economy 69, 213{225..


60


(a) There are three Nash equilibria: (1) both ¯rms charge p = 5, (2) both ¯rms charge p = 6,
and (3) both ¯rms charge p = 7. The reason whole-dollar pricing results in multiple Nash
equilibria is that one has to undercut by a discrete amount, not by just a fraction of a cent.


(b) Now to undercut your rival, you must drop price by at least 3 to get the whole market. (If

you undercut by 2, you get half the other's customers). There is only one Nash equilibrium:

both ¯rms charge p = 10.


(c) Same as in part (b). One Nash equilibrium: both ¯rms charge p = 10.


(d) There is no advantage to further increasing switching costs once s = 2.


12.8 [¤] Twenty ¯ve di®erent stores sell the same product in a given area to a

population of two thousand consumers. Consumers are equally likely to ¯rst visit any

of the twenty ¯ve stores. Half of the consumers have no search costs and purchase

at the lowest price. The other half is willing to buy one unit of the product up to a

maximum of $70 and must incur a cost of $44 in order to ¯nd out about the prices

charged by other stores. Each store can sell up to 50 units and has a unit cost of $25.

(a) Show that, in equilibrium, there exist at most two di®erent prices.

(b) Show that, if there exist two di®erent equilibrium prices, then the higher price

must be 70.

(c) Show that the following is an equilibrium: 5 ¯rms set a price of 70 and the

remaining 20 ¯rms set a price of 45.


Solution: a. As in Exercise 12.6;

b. If the high price is lower than 70, a ¯rm that deviates by slightly increasing price does

not lose market share since consumers are not willing to pay the search cost. Therefore, the

¯rm is strictly better o®. Hence, all ¯rms would want to deviate upwards, so that the high

price must be 70.

c. [There are two typos in this problem: each store's capacity is given by 90 units, not

50. Moreover, consumers with zero search cost have willingness to pay of 45.]

First notice that, given the search costs for ¯rst type of consumers, we can safely assume

that these consumers will not search, rather will compare price to their willingness to pay

(70).

At the proposed prices, pro¯ts are as follows: for a ¯rm setting p = 70, demand is given
by 1,000/25=40 and total pro¯t is 40(70 ¡ 25) = 1; 800. For a ¯rm setting p = 45, total
demand is 1; 000=25 + 1; 000=20 = 90 and total pro¯t is 90(45 ¡ 25) = 1; 800.
A p = 45 ¯rm could deviate by setting a lower price. It would get more demand but,
since it is selling at capacity, pro¯t would be lower. It could set a higher price but would

then only keep the high valuation consumers. It could at most make a pro¯t equal to the

pro¯t currently earned by the p = 70 ¯rms, which in turn is equal to its current pro¯t. We
thus conclude that such ¯rm would not want to charge a di®erent price.


61


A p = 70 ¯rm could deviate by setting a lower price. Any price below 70 and above
45 leads to the same demand but a lower margin. By setting a price equal or lower than
45, the ¯rm would get less than what p = 45 currently get, which in turn is the same as a
p = 70 ¯rm currently gets.


13.1 Explain how advertising expenditures with no direct informational content

can increase market e±ciency.


Solution: As discussed in Section 13.1, advertising expenditures may signal product

quality. In the presence of repeat purchases, a ¯rm that produces a high-quality good and

sells the good not only in the present but also in the future, will have more to gain from

getting customers to try its product than a ¯rm that produces a low-quality good. This is

because once a good is purchased, consumers become aware of its quality; in the future they

will buy the high-quality good. If, however, a consumer does not get to try the good in the

present, in the future he or she will still be uncertain about the good's quality. Therefore,

high-quality goods producers will try to lure customers in the present since their gain is

higher. They thus have an incentive to di®erentiate themselves from low-quality goods

producers.

Although advertising has no direct informational content, the equilibrium with adver
tising may be more e±cient than the equilibrium without advertising. Absent advertising,

high-quality ¯rms have no incentive to produce, since they cannot di®erentiate themselves;

their products are ex-ante identical to the ones produced by low-quality ¯rms. Therefore,

if consumers value high-quality goods, even if there are savings in advertising expenditures,

the overall e±ciency e®ect may be negative, due to the loss in the availability of high-quality

goods.


13.2 [¤] Empirical evidence suggests that the probability of a household switching

to a di®erent brand of breakfast cereal is increasing in the advertising intensity of

that brand. However, the e®ect of advertising is signi¯cantly lower for households

who have previously tried that brand. [3][4] What does this suggest about the nature of

advertising expenditures (persuasion vs information)?


Solution: To answer this question one can simply parallel the explanation provided in

Box 13.1. The e®ect on the probability of switching is high when the consumer did not try

the product before and low if the consumer has already tried the product. This is consistent

with the hypothesis that advertising has an informative e®ect.

13.3 Consider the following industries: pharmaceuticals, cement, perfumes,

fast food, compact cars. How would you expect them to be ordered by advertising

intensity? Why?


Solution: According to the Dorfman-Steiner formula, advertising intensity is proportional

to the demand elasticity of advertising expenditures and inversely proportional to the price

elasticity of demand. Price elasticity of demand is lowest for pharmaceuticals and perfumes,

highest for cement. Advertising elasticity is lowest for cement, highest for perfumes (and

some pharmaceuticals). We would expect advertising intensity to be highest for pharma
ceuticals and perfumes, lowest for cement, intermediate for fast food and compact cars.


13.4 In Section ??, it was argued that advertising intensity under duopoly

should be greater than under monopoly. DeBeers, the dominant ¯rm in the diamond

industry (a cartel that in many respects is like a monopoly), spends vast resources

on advertising. More recently, DeBeers has also started to advertise diamonds and

the name DeBeers. Is this consistent with the analysis of Section ??? What aspects

of the diamond industry are not re°ected in the analysis of Section ???


Solution: The value of diamonds is, to a great extent, a consequence of the perception

of scarcity. Advertising has played a very important role in the diamond industry, both by

increasing demand and by inducing a perception of scarcity. In this sense, there is a strong

\public good" element in the advertising of diamonds. By controlling the distribution of

diamonds, DeBeers is able to internalize this extrenality. Recent events in the industry (the

cartel defection of the Australian mines and the emergence of non-cartel mines in Canada) is

likely to lead to a more fragmented market structure. The \public good" e®ect would then

imply lower levels of advertising. However, with DeBeers controlling a smaller market share,

the market-share-shifting e®ect of advertising is now more important, leading possibly to

higher levels of advertising. Finally, in addition to changes in the level of advertising we are

also likely to observe a shift in the nature of the advertising expenditures, with a greater

emphasis on branding and less on generic characteristics of diamonds.


13.5 Which of the two cars, BMW series 5 and Nissan Sentra, would you expect

to have a greater price elasticity? Based on this, which car would you expect to have

a greater advertising to sales ratio? Is the empirical evidence consistent with this?


Solution: One would expect the price elasticity of demand to be higher for compact cars,

both because branding e®ects are likely to be smaller in this price range and because the

number of competing models is greater. See Box 12.1 for data from the US car market.

13.6 Consider the values in Table 1. In which industries do you expect adver
tising intensity to be higher?


Solution: We know from Equation 13.1 that a

portional to advertising elasticity and inversely proportional to price elasticity. Therefore,

for the table in the exercise we have:

13.7 [¤¤] Your company sells expensive, branded fountain pens. Currently, there

are 100,000 people aware of your pens. Each of these 100,000 people has his or

her own willingness to pay for your pens. These willingness-to-pay numbers are
uniformly distributed between $0 and $500. So, your demand curve is given by Q =
100000(1¡p=500). Your marginal cost per pen is $100. Well-versed in economics, you
are pricing your pens at $300 each, and selling 40,000 pens, generating a contribution

of $8 million.

You have just become brand manager for these fountain pens. The previous brand

manager engaged in very little advertising, but you are considering running a major

promotional campaign to build your brand image and visibility. Your are considering

two possible advertising campaigns, call them \Build Value," \Expand Reach." (You

will either run one of these campaigns or none at all; you cannot run both.)

The \Build Value" campaign will not reach any new potential customers, but will

increase the willingness to pay of each of your current 100,000 existing customers by

25%. This campaign costs $2.5 million to run.

The \Expand Reach" campaign will expand the set of potential customers by

25%, from 100,000 to 125,000. The 25,000 new customers reached will have the

same distribution of willingness-to-pay as the pre-existing 100,000 potential customers

(namely, uniformly distributed between $0 and $500). This campaign costs $1.8

million to run.

(a) If your choice were between running the \Build Value" campaign and running

no campaign at all, would you choose to run the \Build Value" campaign?

(b) If your choice were between running the \Expand Reach" campaign and run
ning no campaign at all, would you choose to run the \Expand Reach" campaign?

Show your calculations.

(c) What choice would you make in this situation: run the \Build Value" cam
paign, run the \Expand Reach" campaign, or run neither?


Solution:


(a) If you run the \Build Value" campaign, the willingness-to-pay of your 100,000 potential
customers will be uniformly distributed between $0 and $625, since $625 is 25% higher than

¡ ¡
$500. Thus, your demand will shift from Q = 100; 000(1 p=500) to Q = 100; 000(1

¡ ¡
p=625). Put di®erently, demand will shift from p = 500(1 Q=100; 000) to p = 625(1
Q=100; 000). With this new demand curve, the corresponding marginal revenue curve is
MR = 625(1 ¡ Q=50; 000). Setting MR equal to the marginal cost of $100 and solving for Q
gives Q [¤] = 42; 000. The corresponding price is p [¤] = $362:50. This generates a contribution
of $11,025,000, or $3,025,000 higher than without the campaign. Since this exceeds the $2.5

million cost of the campaign, the \Build Value" campaign is worth running, rather than no

campaign at all.


65


(b) If you run the \Expand Reach" campaign, you will now face 125,000 customers with

willingness-to-pay uniformly distributed between $0 and $500. Thus, your demand will

shift from Q = 100; 000(1 ¡ p=500) to Q = 125; 000(1 ¡ p=500). Solving for p gives
p = 500(1 ¡Q=125; 000), with corresponding marginal revenue of MR = 500(1¡ Q=62; 500).
Setting this equal to the marginal cost of $100 and solving for Q gives Q [¤] = 50; 000. The
corresponding price is p [¤] = $300. This generates a contribution of $10,000,000, or $2,000,000
higher than without the campaign. Since this exceeds the $1.8 million cost of the campaign,

the \Expand Reach" campaign is worth running, rather than no campaign at all.


(c) In comparison with running no campaign, the \Build Value" campaign adds $525,000 to

pro¯ts. In comparison with running no campaign, the \Expand Reach" campaign adds

$200,000 to pro¯ts. Since you can only pick one, you should pick the \Build Value" cam
paign.


13.8 [¤¤] The e®ect of advertising expenditures can be decomposed into (a) e®ect

on total market demand and (b) e®ect on market shares. Accordingly, the following cases can be distinguished, where qi is ¯rm i's demand and ai its advertising
expenditure: [3][5]


Cooperative advertising: @ qj = @ ai > 0
Predatory advertising: @ qj = @ ai < 0
Perfectly cooperative advertising: @ qi = @ ai = @ qj = @ ai
Completely predatory advertising: @ qi = @ ai + @ qj = @ ai = 0


Empirical studies suggest the following values of demand elasticity with respect
to advertising levels. [36]

¤¤¤¤¤ Cross elasticity is the elasticity of qi with respect to aj.
NB: these are derivatives of market share with respect to advertising level.


Based on the above classi¯cation, how do you characterize advertising expendi
tures on cola drinks, saltine crackers and cigarettes?


Solution: These are all instances of predatory advertising since the cross-elasticities are

negative, that is, increasing advertisisng decreases the market share of competitors.


14.1 Explain in words why the number of ¯rms in a free-entry equilibrium may

be less than proportional to market size.


Solution: The explanation lies in the fact that as the number of ¯rms increases, so does

competition. As a result, prices will fall, reducing the margin, p ¡ c. Therefore, variable
pro¯t per unit of market size decreases, making the number of ¯rms the market can sustain

increase less than proportionally to market size.


14.2 [¤] Suppose that two countries, initially in autarchy, decide to create a single

market. For simplicity, assume that, in both economies, there is only one product.
Demand for this product is given by Di = Si(a ¡pi); (i = 1; 2), where Si is a measure
of country i's size. Upon the creation of a single market, total demand is given by
the horizontal sum of the two initial demands.
Assuming there is free entry and that ¯rms compete µa la Cournot, determine
the equilibrium number of ¯rms in autarchy and after the completion of the single
market. Interpret the results.


Solution: In autarchy we have pi = a ¡ [D] Si [i] [. Assuming that the cost function takes the]

form c(qik) = F + cqik (where i indexes the country and k indexes the ¯rm), each ¯rm solves

the problem max[(p ¡ c)qik ¡ F ] which is equivalent to max[(a ¡ c ¡ PSki [q][ik] )qik ¡ F ]. The

¯rst order condition is given by a ¡ c ¡ [(][n][+1)] Si [q][ik] = 0 (due to the symmetry assumption),



therefore, we have the solution for each ¯rm's quantity qik = [(][a][¡][c][)][S][i]




[¡] [i]

n+1 [. The pro¯ts for each]



¯rm will be ¼i(ni) = ³ nai¡+1c ´2 Si ¡ F . In a free entry equilibrium these pro¯ts should be 0.



Therefore we have the solution: ni = ·(a ¡ c)q



SFi [¡][ 1] ¸.



After the completion of the single market the size of the market increases, and, as it is
assumed, demand becomes D1+2 = D1 + D2 = (S1 + S2)(a ¡ p). Using the same general



formula that we derived for the autarchy case we obtain that n1+2 = ·(a ¡ c)q



S1+S2 ¡ 1¸.

F



This tells us that some ¯rms will exit, the explanation for this being the same as in Exercise

14.1.


67


14.3 [¤] The number of imported automobiles in California is four times higher

than in Montana, in per capita terms. The population of Californian is mainly urban,

whereas the population of Montana is mainly rural. How do demographic di®erences

and the model presented in Section ?? explain the di®erences in consumption pat
terns? [3][7]


Solution: The model predicts that smaller markets will have fewer ¯rms and higher

margins. The fact that the population of Montana is mainly rural implies that the typical

market for a car dealer is smaller than in California.


14.4 [¤] Retail in Switzerland is mostly dominated by highly pro¯table cartels.

The Swiss authorities anticipate the gradual collapse of these cartels as the country

becomes better integrated with the rest of Europe. OECD, by contrast, hold a more

sceptical view, claiming that the collapse of cartels does not necessarily lead to more

competitive markets; rather, they add, cartel breakdowns are frequently associated

with an increase in concentration. Which prediction seems more reasonable? Are the

two views inconsistent?


Solution: Integration is likely to imply greater competition from foreign suppliers. Lower

margins will then imply that the Swiss market cannot hold the same number of ¯rms as

currently. It is therefore possible that the two predictions hold true: that prices go down

and that the industry becomes more concentrated.


14.5 \Barriers to entry may be welfare improving." What particular industry

characteristics might make this statement valid?


Solution: Following the discussion in Section 14.3, free entry may decrease welfare when

the business stealing e®ect dominates. For this to happen, as in the example of retail bank
ing, the product or service should be relatively homogenous (so that product di®erentiation

is unimportant) and price competition should be soft. In this case, paying a fee for setting

up a branch represents a barrier to entry and may act as an e±cient means of blocking

excessive entry.


14.6 [¤¤] Show that the coe±cient of scale economies, AC =MC, is greater than
one if and only if average cost is decreasing.


37Adapted from an exercise written by T. Bresnahan.

respect to Output q, we get

It follows that AC is greater than MC if and only if [d] [AC] d q < 0, that is, average cost is

decreasing.


14.7 [¤¤¤] Consider the model presented in Section ??. Suppose that ¯rms can

choose one of two possible technologies, with cost functions Ci = Fi + ciq.
a) Derive the conditions for a free-entry equilibrium.

b) Show, by means of numerical example, that there can be more than one equi
librium, with di®erent numbers of large and small ¯rms.


Solution: a) Suppose that demand is given by Q = a ¡ p. There are two types of ¯rms,
Firm i's pro¯t is given by (a¡ Q)qi ¡Ci. The ¯rst-order condition for pro¯t maximization is
qi = a ¡ ci ¡ Q. Suppose that in equilibrium each of the ni ¯rms with technology i product
output qi. Then Q = n1q1 + n2q2. Solving the system of ¯rst-order conditions, we get


qi [¤][(][n][1][; n][2][) =] [a][ ¡][ c][j][ ¡][ n][i][(][c][j][ ¡][ c][i][)] ;

1 + n1 + n2


for i; j = 1; 2 and i 6= j. From these equations, we can get Q [¤] (n1; n2), the equilibrium total
output when there are ni ¯rms of each type:



Q [¤] (n1; n2) = n1 a ¡ c2 ¡ n1(c2 ¡ c1)



1 +2 ¡ n n11 +(c n2 ¡2 c1) + n2 a ¡ c1 +1 ¡ n n12 +(c n1 ¡2 c2)



:
1 + n1 + n2



The equilibrium conditions are then given by

a ¡ Q [¤] (n1; n2) qi [¤][(][n][1][; n][2][)] ¸ Fi + ciqi [¤][(][n][1][; n][2][)]
³ ´

a ¡ Q [¤] (ni + 1; nj) qi [¤][(][n][i] [+ 1][; n][j][)]        - Fi + ciqi [¤][(][n][i] [+ 1][; n][j][)]
³ ´

a ¡ Q [¤] (ni + 1; nj ¡ 1) qi [¤][(][n][i] [+ 1][; n][j] [¡][ 1)][¡]
³ ´

Fi + ciqi [¤][(][n][i] [+ 1][; n][j] [¡][ 1)]              - a ¡ Q [¤] (n1; n2) qj [¤][(][n][1][; n][2][)]
³ ´ ³ ´


¡ Fj + cjqj [¤][(][n][1][; n][2][)]
³ ´


The ¯rst of these conditions implies that incumbent ¯rms make positive pro¯ts. The second

condition implies that a potential entrant would make negative pro¯ts. The third condi
tion implies that an incumbent would not gain from switching technologies. Note that all

conditions apply for i = 1; 2. We thus have a total of six equilibrium conditions.


69


b) The following values satisfy the equations above: a = 1000; F1 = 173; c1 = 0; F2 =
10:3; c2 = 10; n1 = 60; n2 = 60.


14.8 [¤] Consider the monopolistic competition model, presented in Chapter ??.

What is, according to this model, the relation between the degree of product di®er
entiation and market structure?


Solution: Refer to Figure 6.3 the solution to Exercise 6.2. The greater the degree of

product di®erentiation, the steeper the demand curve d faced by each ¯rm. In the long run,

price equal average cost. Therefore, the steeper d is the lower each ¯rm's output is in the

long run equilibrium. We would therefore expect a more fragmented market structure when

the degree of product di®erentiation is higher.


14.9 [¤¤] T. Bresnahan and P. Reiss collected data for small, geographically isolated

U.S. towns, on population as well as on the number of doctors, dentists, plumbers,

etc., in each town. Based on these data, they estimated that the minimum town size

that justi¯es the entry of a second doctor is approximately 3.96 times the required

size for the ¯rst doctor to enter. For plumbers, the number is 2.12. How can these

numbers be interpreted?


Solution: The higher number for doctors has two interpretations. The ¯rst one is that

competition between two doctors is very intense, so that it would take a much larger market

before the second doctor could recoup entry costs. The second interpretation is that there

are speci¯c barriers to entry by a second doctor which are not present in the case of a

plumber.

14.11 [¤¤¤] Consider the following model of entry into an advertising-intensive

industry. To simplify the analysis, and to concentrate on the e®ects of advertising,

suppose that there is no price competition. Speci¯cally, the value of the market, in

total sales, is given by S. (One can think of a demand curve D(p) and an exogenously

given price, whereby S = pD(p).) S is therefore a measure of market size .

Each ¯rm must decide whether or not to enter the industry. Entry cost is given

by F . If a ¯rm decides to enter, then it must also choose how much to invest in

advertising; let ai be the amount chosen by ¯rm i. Finally, ¯rm i's market share, si,
is assumed to be equal to its share of the industry total advertising e®ort:

e) With this speci¯cation of the model we have, from b), that advertising expenditures

increase with market size. This is an instance of endougenous entry costs, where because of

this costly investment in advertising, the net industry pro¯t grows by less than the market

size (as can also be observed form c)). As a result, even if price is exogenously given, as it

is in our model, the number of ¯rms increases by less than the market size, as the result in

d) shows.


15.1 [¤] LC Burgers is currently the sole fast-food chain in Linear city, a city that

is one mile long and consists of one street, with one thousand consumers distributed

uniformly along the street. The price for the BigLC, the only product sold by the LC

Burger chain, is set nationally at $4, so that the local Linear city manager's decision

is limited to choosing the number and location of its stores.

Each store costs $600,000 to open and lasts inde¯nitely. Each consumer buys one

burger per week at the current price of $4. However, no consumer will walk for more

than a quarter of a mile to buy a burger. Operating costs are $1 per burger. The

interest rates is 0.1% per week. The market conditions are unchanging, so present

discounted pro¯ts can be regarded as level perpetuities.

(a) Suppose that LC Burgers faces no competition and no threat of entry. How

many stores should LC Burgers open, and at what locations?

CS Burgers is contemplating entering Linear city. CS Burgers' costs and price are

the same as those of LC Burgers. Moreover, consumers regard the products at both

chains as equally good, so, if both brands are in town, each consumers buys from the

closest store.

(b) At what locations should CS Burgers open stores, given that LC Burgers has

opened the locations found to be optimal in part (a)?

(c) Recognizing the threat of entry by CS Burgers, at what locations should LC

Burgers open stores?

(d) Would your analysis of these product-location decisions be a®ected if you

also considered the possibility of pricing competition, i.e., if prices were then set

independently given the locations of the stores (rather than taking prices as ¯xed, as

was done above)?

(e) Moving beyond this particular model, does product positioning involve a ¯rst
mover advantage, a second-move advantage, or does this depend upon particular

aspects of the market in question?


Solution: With two stores, one at .25 and the other at .75 (miles from the left end of

the street), LC Burgers is able to cover the entire market. Any additional store would not

increase demand and would thus be sub-optimal. By opening two stores, LC Burgers makes a

discounted pro¯t of 1000($4¡$1)=:1%¡2$600; 000 = $1:8m. If LC Burgers were to open one
store only, the maximum it could possibly get is 500 ¤ ($4 ¡ $3)=:1% ¡ $600; 000 = $900; 000.
CS Burgers is contemplating entering Linear city. CS Burgers' costs and price are the

same as those of LC Burgers. Moreover, consumers regard the products at both chains as

equally good, so, if both brands are in town, each consumers buys from the closest store.

(b) CS Burger should open four stores, to the immediate left and right of LC Burger's stores,

thus stealing all of the market demand. Given these locations, CS Burger would receive

a demand of 1,000 and a discounted pro¯t (net of entry costs) of 1; 000($4 ¡ $3)=:1% ¡
4$600; 000 = $600; 000. Notice that, under this outcome, LC Burger's pro¯t is ¡$1:2m (two
stores, no revenues).


(c) LC Burger should open three stores and locate them at .1666, .5 and .8333. Given these

locations, the maximum an entrant can get is one sixth of the market (check). Given

this demand, discounted pro¯ts are 166($4 ¡ $3)=:1% ¡ $600; 000 = ¡$100; 000. Under this
location strategy, LC Burgers gets a total pro¯t of 1; 000($4¡$3)=:1%¡3$600; 000 = $1:2m.
This is substantially less than (unchallenged) monopoly pro¯ts (as in (a)). However, it is

more than LC Burgers would get by choosing the same locations as in (a) (¡$1.2m).

Notice that, while these locations are optimal, they are not the only optimal solution.

The important thing is that an entrant cannot achieve a market share of 20% or more, where

20% is the minimum market share necessary to recover entry costs (check). Therefore, any

solution with a store between .1 and .2, one at .5, and a third one between .8 and .9 would

also be optimal. The solution proposed above, however, is the only three-store solution that

deters entry when entry costs are as low as $500,000.


(d) If there were price competition, then we would expect ¯rms not to locate their stores very

close to each other. In particular, CS Burger's entry strategy in (b). would unlikely take

place as ¯rms would then compete as in the Bertrand model, yielding zero pro¯ts for in
cumbent and entrant.


(e) In the case considered above, there is clearly a ¯rst-mover advantage: the ¯rst-mover makes

positive pro¯ts, whereas the second mover stays out of the market and makes zero pro¯ts.

Suppose however that each ¯rm has limited resources and can open on store only. Then it

can be seen that, whichever location the ¯rst ¯rm chooses, the second ¯rm can choose a

location that gives it pro¯ts at least as large.


15.2 In less than one year after the deregulation of the German telecommu
nications market at the start of 1998, domestic long-distance rates have fallen by

more than 70%. Deutsche Telekom, the former monopolist, accompanied some of

these rate drops by increases in monthly fees and local calls. MobilCom, one of the

main competitors, fears it may be unable to match the price reductions. Follow
ing the announcement of a price reduction by Deutche Telekom at the end of 1998,

shares of MobilCom fell by 7%. Two other competitors, O.tel.o and Mannesmann

Arcor, said they would match the price cuts. VIAG Interkom, however, accused

Telekom of \competition-distorting behavior," claiming the company is exploiting its

(still remaining) monopoly power in the local market to subsidize its long-distance
business. [3][8]

Is this a case of predatory pricing? Present arguments in favor and against such

assertion.


Solution: One culd indeed argue that this is a case of predatory pricing. If Deutsche

Telekon has monopoly in local markets, it likely has ¯nancial resouces strong enough to

a®ord losing money in the long distance market by pricing below marginal cost. However,

since there are two other competitors that matched Deutsche Telekom's prices, one can argue

that there exists technology with marginal cost less than the low-price charged. Evidently,

other explanations can also invoked, namely low-cost signaling and reputation for toughness.

(See the discussion in the chapter.)


15.3 \The combined output of two merging ¯rms decreases as a result of the

merger." True or false?


Solution: If the merger implies little or no cost e±ciencies (namely at the level of marginal

cost), we would expect the combined output of the merging ¯rms to decline. If however the

merger reduces the marginal cost of the combined ¯rm signi¯cantly, then it is possible that

the combined output increases as a result of the merger.


15.4 [¤] One of the e±ciencies created by mergers in the paper industry results

from reorganization of production. A machine is more e±cient the narrower the range

of products it produces, among other reasons because the length of each production

run can be made longer.

The paper industry underwent a wave of mergers in the 1980s. Of the ¯rms that

merged, about two thirds increased their market share as a result of the merger. As
suming that (i) ¯rms compete by setting production capacity and (ii) paper products

are relatively homogeneous across ¯rms, explain how the previous paragraph explains

the pattern of changes in market shares. Which ¯rms would you expect to increase

their market share? [39]


Solution: According to the paragraph, there are increased cost e±ciencies from mergers.

Applying the analysis from Section 15.3, it seems that for two thirds of the merging ¯rms

the cost e±ciencies were so big that the merging ¯rms increased their output and market

share, while for the rest the e±ciencies were not big enough, resulting in a decreased market

share.

15.5 \The renewed prospect of a link-up between British Aerospace PLC and

the Marconi defense arm of General Electric Co. PLC of the U.K. as led to revived

talks between the top defense companies in Germany and France." [4][0] Discuss.


Solution: Refer to the discussion on merger waves in this chapter.


15.6 Consider a homogeneous product industry with inverse demand given by

p = 100 ¡ 2Q. Variable cost is given by C = 10q. There is currently one incumbent
¯rm and one potential competitor. Entry into the industry implies a sunk cost of F .
(a) Determine the incumbent's optimal output in the absence of potential com
petition.

(b) Suppose the entrant takes the incumbent's output choice as given. Show that

the entrant's equilibrium pro¯t is decreasing in the incumbent's output.

(c) What output should the incumbent ¯rm set in order to deter entry?

(d) Assuming that the incumbent ¯rm decides to deter entry, determine the Lerner
index as a function of F . Discuss the result.
(e) Determine the lowest value of E such that the incumbent ¯rm prefers to deter

entry.



Solution: a) The incumbent solves max[pq ¡ c(q)] = max[(100 ¡ 2q)q ¡ 10q]. The ¯rst
order condition is 90 ¡ 4q = 0 and the solution is q = 22:5.
b) Taking the incumbent's output choice as given, the potential entrant solves the fol
lowing problem: max[100 ¡ 2(qi + qe)]qe ¡ 10qe ¡ F . The ¯rst-order condition is given by
90 ¡ 2qi ¡ 4qe = 0, and the solution is qe = 22:5 ¡ [q] 2 [i] [. Plugging this result into the entrant's]

pro¯t function we obtain ¼e = 2(22:5 ¡ [q] 2 [i] [)][2][ ¡][ F] [. As one can see, the bigger is][ q][i][, the lower]

the entrant's pro¯ts are.
c) Knowing that ¼e = 2(22:5 ¡ [q] 2 [i] [)][2][ ¡][ F] [, in order to deter entry the incumbent has to]



set qi such that ¼e = 0. Therefore we have qi = 2(22:5 ¡
q



F



set qi such that ¼e = 0. Therefore we have qi = 2(22:5 ¡ 2 [).]

d) Since there is only one ¯rm in the market (entry is deterred) the market share is equal
to 1, therefore, the lerner index is L = [p][¡] p [MC] . In our case, p = 100 ¡ 2qi = 100 ¡ 4(22:4¡

q F2 [) = 10 +] p8F, MC = 10, hence L = 1 10+10 ~~p~~ 8F [. This basically says that the higher]



F2 [) = 10 +] p



8F, MC = 10, hence L = 1 10
¡ 10+ ~~p~~



F



8F, MC = 10, hence L = 1

2 [) = 10 +] ¡ 10+ ~~p~~ 8F [. This basically says that the higher]

the sunk costs, the higher the concentration index. In order to deter entry, the incumbent

deviates from its optimal monopoly output choice. However, sunk cost act as a barrier to

entry. Therefore, the higher the sunk costs, the smaller the incumbent's deviation from the

monopoly output choice and the higher the concentration.
