## Part Five: Contractual Relations Between Firms (Chapters 15-18)

### Chapter 15: Horizontal Mergers
- **Merger paradox:** In Cournot model, mergers often unprofitable unless:
  - Merger creates Stackelberg leader position
  - Significant cost synergies exist
  - Many firms merge simultaneously
- **Merger simulation:**
  - PCAIDS (Proportionally Calibrated AIDS) system
  - Estimate demand elasticities, compute post-merger prices
  - Lerner condition: L = (P - MC)/P
- **HHI thresholds:**
  - <1500: unconcentrated
  - 1500-2500: moderately concentrated
  - >2500: highly concentrated
- **Merger evaluation tools:** Divestiture, "fix-it-first" approach

### Chapter 16: Vertical Integration
- **Double marginalization:** Two successive monopolies → price too high
  - Vertical integration solves this problem
- **Vertical mergers in Cournot:**
  - Upstream and downstream foreclosure effects
  - Raising rivals' costs strategy
- **GE-Honeywell case:** Concerns about bundling post-merger
- **Cement/ready-mixed concrete market:** Empirical evidence

### Chapter 17: Vertical Price Restraints
- **Resale Price Maintenance (RPM):**
  - Minimum RPM: Sets price floor
  - Maximum RPM: Sets price ceiling
- **Service provision model:**
  - Retailers provide costly services that increase demand
  - Free-riding problem: Discount stores benefit from full-service stores
  - RPM can solve free-riding by guaranteeing retail margins
- **Dorfman-Steiner for retail services:** s² = (P - r)/(slope of demand)
- **RPM and collusion:**
  - Can facilitate manufacturer collusion (easier to monitor)
  - Can facilitate retailer collusion
- **Legal evolution:**
  - *Dr. Miles* (1911): Per se illegal
  - *Leegin* (2007): Rule of reason

### Chapter 18: Non-Price Vertical Restraints
- **Exclusive territories:** Prevent intra-brand competition
- **Exclusive dealing:** Prevent inter-brand competition
  - Can foreclose rivals from distribution
- **Franchising and divisionalization:**
  - Franchise fees extract retailer surplus
  - Divisionalization can increase competitive intensity
- **US beer industry empirics:** Exclusive dealing effects

## Part Six: Non-Price Competition (Chapters 19-21)

### Chapter 19: Advertising
- **Dorfman-Steiner condition:**
  - A/R = εₐ/|εₚ|
  - Advertising/sales ratio equals ratio of elasticities
- **Advertising as information:**
  - Informative: Expands market awareness
  - Persuasive: Shifts preferences, may reduce competition
- **Signaling through advertising:**
  - High advertising signals high quality (experience goods)
  - Nelson (1974): "Burning money" as quality signal
- **Advertising and market structure:**
  - Can be barrier to entry
  - May increase or decrease price competition

### Chapter 20: Research and Development
- **Innovation types:**
  - Process innovation: Reduces production cost
  - Product innovation: Creates new/improved goods
- **Drastic vs. non-drastic innovations:**
  - Drastic: Monopolist's ideal price < competitive price
  - Non-drastic: Must limit price to deter fringe
- **Schumpeterian hypothesis:**
  - Large firms and concentrated markets → more innovation
  - Arrow (1962): Competitive firms have more incentive
  - Empirical evidence: Mixed, inverted-U relationship
- **Patent races:**
  - Winner-take-all competition
  - May lead to over-investment in R&D
  - Dasgupta-Stiglitz model
- **R&D spillovers:**
  - Knowledge leaks to rivals
  - Reduce private incentives, increase social value
- **R&D cooperation:**
  - Research Joint Ventures (RJVs)
  - Can internalize spillovers

### Chapter 21: Patents and Patent Policy
- **Optimal patent life:**
  - Trade-off: Innovation incentives vs. deadweight loss
  - Nordhaus model: Balancing considerations
- **Optimal patent breadth:**
  - Narrow: Many substitutes possible
  - Broad: Few substitutes, more monopoly power
  - Gilbert-Shapiro: "Long and thin" may be optimal
- **Patent licensing:**
  - Royalty vs. fixed fee
  - Can increase welfare by spreading technology
- **Strategic patenting:**
  - Sleeping patents: Block competitors without commercializing
  - Patent thickets: Dense web of overlapping patents
- **Patent reform issues:**
  - Non-practicing entities (NPEs)
  - Quality of patents granted

## Part Seven: Networks, Auctions, and Strategic Commitment (Chapters 22-24)

### Chapter 22: Network Effects and Network Goods
- **Network externalities:**
  - Direct: Value increases with users (telephone, social media)
  - Indirect: Value through complements (hardware-software)
- **Critical mass:** Minimum adoption for market takeoff
- **Multiple equilibria:**
  - Low-adoption and high-adoption equilibria
  - Coordination problems
- **Installed base:** Source of competitive advantage
- **Standards competition:**
  - Compatibility vs. proprietary strategies
  - Tipping: Market converges to single standard
  - Battle of the Sexes game
- **Path dependence:** Historical accidents affect outcomes
- **Two-sided markets:** Platforms must attract both sides

### Chapter 23: Auctions
- **Auction types:**
  - English (ascending): Open, price rises until one bidder remains
  - Dutch (descending): Price falls until someone bids
  - First-price sealed bid: Highest bid wins, pays bid
  - Second-price sealed bid (Vickrey): Highest bid wins, pays second-highest

- **Private values model:**
  - Each bidder knows own value, not others'
  - Values drawn independently from distribution

- **Equilibrium bidding strategies:**
  - English/Second-price: Bid true value (dominant strategy)
  - Dutch/First-price: Shade bid below value
  - With uniform distribution on [0, V_max] and n bidders:
    - Expected k-th highest value: E[v(k)] = k/(n+1) × V_max
    - Optimal bid in first-price: b(vᵢ) = ((n-1)/n) × vᵢ

- **Revenue Equivalence Theorem:**
  - All four auction types yield same expected revenue
  - Conditions: Independent private values, risk-neutral bidders

- **Common value auctions:**
  - True value same for all, but privately estimated
  - **Winner's curse:** Winning means you likely overestimated
  - Must shade bid to account for information in winning

- **Affiliated values:**
  - Between private and common values
  - Revenue equivalence fails
  - English > Second-price > First-price in expected revenue

- **Auctions and Industrial Organization:**
  - Bertrand pricing as auction: p(cᵢ) = C_max/n + ((n-1)/n)cᵢ
  - Asymmetric bidders: Incumbent vs. entrant dynamics

- **Empirical application:** Ohio school milk markets (Porter & Zona 1999)
  - Complementary bidding patterns detected collusion
  - Incumbents bid differently in competitive vs. collusive regions

### Chapter 24: Strategic Commitments and International Trade
- **Strategic subsidies (Brander-Spencer 1985):**
  - Government subsidizes domestic "national champion"
  - In Cournot duopoly, optimal subsidy: s* = (A - c)/4
  - Net benefit positive: NB(s*) = (A - c)²/72
  - Achieves Stackelberg leader output: q(s*) = (A - c)/2

- **Strategic tariffs with scale economies:**
  - Tariff raises foreign firm's cost
  - Scale effects amplify advantage
  - Krugman (1986): Tariff as commitment device

- **R&D subsidies:**
  - Less directly violates WTO rules
  - Shifts R&D reaction functions
  - Spencer-Brander (1983): Optimal R&D subsidy always positive

- **Trade agreements as commitment devices:**
  - WTO prevents beggar-thy-neighbor policies
  - Prisoners' dilemma without agreements
  - "Tie hands" argument: Politicians can resist domestic pressure

- **Empirical application:** Canadian Wheat Board (Hamilton-Stiegert 2002)
  - State Trading Enterprise (STE)
  - Observed subsidies close to theoretically optimal
  - Conjectural variations parameter λ ≈ 1 (Cournot)
