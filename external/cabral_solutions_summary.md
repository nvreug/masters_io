## Key Concepts by Chapter

### Chapter 2: Costs, Demand, and Markets
- **Price-taking firms:** P = MC at optimum
- **Cost functions:** Deriving MC, AC from total cost
- **Consumer surplus:** Area under demand curve above price
- **Market equilibrium:** Supply = Demand with welfare analysis

### Chapter 3: Firm Boundaries
- **Make-or-buy decisions:** Transaction costs vs. production costs
- **Vertical integration:** When internal production dominates outsourcing
- **Asset specificity:** Creates hold-up problems favoring integration
- **Core competencies:** Focus on what firm does best

### Chapter 4: Games and Strategy
- **Dominant strategies:** Best response regardless of opponent's action
- **Nash equilibrium:** Mutual best responses; no player wants to deviate
- **Backward induction:** Solve sequential games from end to beginning
- **Subgame perfect equilibrium:** Nash in every subgame
- **Mixed strategies:** Randomization when no pure strategy equilibrium
- **Repeated games:** Cooperation sustainable through punishment strategies
- **Folk theorem:** Many equilibria possible in infinitely repeated games

Key exercises:
- Finding Nash equilibria in 2x2 games
- Sequential games with commitment
- Trigger strategies in repeated games

### Chapter 5: Monopoly
- **Profit maximization:** MR = MC
- **Lerner index:** L = (P - MC)/P = 1/|ε|
- **Deadweight loss:** Triangle between demand and MC
- **Two-part tariffs:** Extract more surplus than uniform pricing
- **Durable goods monopoly:** Coase conjecture, commitment problems

### Chapter 6: Monopolistic Competition
- **Free entry:** Drives profits to zero
- **Product variety:** Trade-off between variety and scale economies
- **Excess capacity:** P > MC but π = 0
- **Chamberlinian tangency:** AC tangent to demand curve

### Chapter 7: Oligopoly Competition
- **Cournot competition:**
  - Firms choose quantities simultaneously
  - Reaction functions: qᵢ = (a - c - qⱼ)/2
  - N-firm equilibrium: q* = (a - c)/(N + 1)
  - As N → ∞, approaches perfect competition

- **Bertrand competition:**
  - Firms choose prices simultaneously
  - With homogeneous goods: P = MC (competitive outcome)
  - Bertrand paradox: Two firms sufficient for competition

- **Stackelberg competition:**
  - Sequential quantity choice
  - Leader advantage: commits first, higher profit
  - Follower accommodates

- **Capacity constraints:** Reconciles Cournot and Bertrand (Edgeworth)

### Chapter 8: Collusion
- **Cartel formation:** Joint profit maximization
- **Sustainability:** Requires sufficiently high discount factor δ
- **Critical discount factor:** δ* = (πᴰ - πᶜ)/(πᴰ - πᴺ)
  - πᶜ = collusion profit, πᴰ = deviation profit, πᴺ = Nash profit
- **Grim trigger:** Permanent reversion to Nash after deviation
- **Price wars:** Can be equilibrium punishment
- **Demand fluctuations:** Green-Porter model, price wars during booms
- **Market characteristics favoring collusion:**
  - Few firms
  - Homogeneous products
  - Frequent interaction
  - Transparent prices
  - High barriers to entry

### Chapter 9: Market Structure
- **Concentration measures:**
  - Concentration ratio (CRₙ): Share of top n firms
  - Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: HHI = Σsᵢ²
- **Market definition:** SSNIP test
- **Entry barriers:** Structural vs. strategic

### Chapter 10: Price Discrimination
- **First-degree:** Perfect price discrimination, extracts all surplus
- **Second-degree (quantity discounts):**
  - Menu of quantity-price bundles
  - Incentive compatibility: high types prefer their bundle
  - Individual rationality: low types participate
  - "No distortion at the top" principle

- **Third-degree (group pricing):**
  - Different prices for observable groups
  - Inverse elasticity rule: Pᵢ/Pⱼ = (1 - 1/|εⱼ|)/(1 - 1/|εᵢ|)

- **Bundling:**
  - Pure bundling vs. mixed bundling
  - Profitable when valuations negatively correlated

### Chapter 11: Vertical Relations
- **Double marginalization:**
  - Upstream monopolist + downstream monopolist
  - Two markups → price too high
  - Vertical integration solves the problem

- **Resale Price Maintenance (RPM):**
  - Manufacturer sets retail price
  - Can solve free-riding on services

- **Exclusive territories:** Prevents intra-brand competition
- **Exclusive dealing:** Prevents inter-brand competition
- **Franchise fees:** Two-part tariffs between firms

### Chapter 12: Product Differentiation
- **Hotelling model:**
  - Consumers located on [0,1] line
  - Transport costs create local monopoly power
  - Minimum differentiation vs. maximum differentiation

- **Switching costs:**
  - Lock-in effects
  - Two-period pricing: low then high
  - Bargain-then-ripoff pattern

- **Search costs:** Create market power even with homogeneous goods

### Chapter 13: Advertising
- **Informative advertising:** Expands market, increases competition
- **Persuasive advertising:** Shifts demand, may reduce competition
- **Dorfman-Steiner condition:** A/R = εₐ/|εₚ|
  - Advertising-to-sales ratio equals ratio of elasticities
- **Advertising as barrier to entry**

### Chapter 14: Entry and Market Structure
- **Free entry:** Entry until profits = entry cost
- **Excess entry theorem:** Free entry may yield too many firms
- **Limit pricing:** Incumbent prices low to deter entry
- **Entry deterrence vs. accommodation:**
  - Depends on cost of deterrence vs. duopoly profits

### Chapter 15: Strategic Behavior
- **Predatory pricing:**
  - Price below cost to drive out rival
  - Requires deep pockets or signaling
  - Chain-store paradox

- **Limit pricing:** Signal low cost to deter entry
- **Raising rivals' costs:** Strategic vertical integration
- **Mergers:**
  - Horizontal: combine competitors
  - Merger paradox: often unprofitable with Cournot competition
  - Efficiency gains can justify mergers

### Chapter 16: Research & Development
- **R&D investment:** Trade-off between innovation and appropriability
- **Patent races:**
  - Winner-take-all competition
  - May lead to over-investment

- **Process vs. product innovation**
- **Spillovers:** Reduce private incentives but increase social value
- **Sleeping patents:** Block competitors without commercializing

### Chapter 17: Networks and Standards
- **Network effects:**
  - Direct: value increases with users (telephone)
  - Indirect: value increases via complements (hardware-software)

- **Critical mass:** Minimum adoption for takeoff
- **Installed base:** Source of competitive advantage
- **Standards wars:**
  - Compatibility vs. proprietary strategies
  - Tipping: market converges to single standard

- **Path dependence:** History matters for equilibrium selection
- **Two-sided markets:** Platform must attract both sides
